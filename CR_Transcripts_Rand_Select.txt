Critical Role Campaign 2 Episode 102 "Ghosts, Dinosaurs, and Stuff"
-MATT-
Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
-TRAVIS-
(hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
-MATT-
Vibrato, thank you.
I always wonder where it's going to go.
Before we jump into tonight's episode, we're going to go ahead and go through some announcements if you don't mind.
The first is our first sponsor for the night which is NordVPN.
-LIAM-
Nord.
-MATT-
Sam, if you don't-- Sam? Sam was supposed--
-LIAM-
Oh, Matt? I'm sorry. If I may, Blackwillow69@aol.com and Cryptonic Override were tricked by the Serial Killer about four months ago.
Remember, they tried to defeat the Ultra Codex and were banished inside the internet.
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wait, wait, wait, but then how are we supposed to, like, do this NordVPN sponsorship, then, if we don't have either of them, and also, what are Sam and Laura doing now if they're not here? (electronic music)
-LAURA-
Blackwillow69, we've been trapped in the dark web for nano-days.
Where in the cyber code are we now?
-SAM-
It's hard to say, Cryptonic Override.
The Serial Killer is so jacked in, he could've uploaded us anywhere.
The brony web, DARPAnet, heck, we might even be in Bing, where no one goes.
-LAURA-
Watch out! Incoming meme cluster.
(dog barking) (digital beeping)
-SAM-
Oh no! A virus firewall.
We've got to hack through it.
Whoa! (digital lasers firing) Laser sword! (grunts) (horse neighs) (glass shatters) (cat cries)
-LAURA-
Wow, now that was some spearfishing, Blackwillow.
You pwned that trojan horse.
-SAM-
Me? I've never seen a cube gleamed IRL before.
Cryptonic Override FTW.
-LAURA-
You know what? We make a pretty elite team.
-SAM-
Live by the code, die by the code.
Am I right?
-LAURA-
We've got to get to safety.
-SAM-
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
-LAURA-
Look, I think somehow we've managed to port into Dani Carr's Pinterest account.
-SAM-
Whoa, it's adorable.
-LAURA-
So cute.
-SAM-
We'll be safe here for a while, but to get out of the dark net we need someone to unjack us from the Ultra Codex.
-LAURA-
But only a class C12 Hackmaster could achieve such a move, and they would definitely need NordVPN.
Where can we find someone like that?
-SAM-
Huh.
Hmm.
-LIAM-
[inaudible] (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Boy.
-TALIESIN-
Damn it.
I swore I was through with my hacker past, but I guess it's time to boot up and suit up.
-TRAVIS-
(gasps)
-TALIESIN-
Right now, NordVPN has a special offer: a three year plan with 70% off, plus an additional month free if you sign up at https://NordVPN.com/criticalrole, https://NordVPN.com/criticalrole, or use a coupon code, Critical Role, at checkout! Now, I'm going to use it for one last slice!
-ASHLEY-
Whoa! (laughter)
-MATT-
Okay.
I guess...
tune in next episode? They're-- They're episodes now, why? Why are-- okay.
Cool, thanks, guys and thank you, NordVPN.
-LIAM-
Yay! (laughter)
-MATT-

We have some quick announcements to get through.
Marisha, you had something you wanted to talk about.
-MARISHA-
Yes, so, you all should join us next Tuesday, July 21st at 4:00pm Pacific for our next episode-- it's never not weird-- of Narrative Telephone.
(cheering) Featuring a story, which we have all definitely heard, from Travis Willingham.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, yeah, woo, so hard.
-SAM-
Oh, it was so good.
The twists, the turns.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, man, what a crazy story.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, the layers.
-MARISHA-
Brutal.
-ASHLEY-
So many layers.
-TRAVIS-
All the different facial expressions.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah.
-LAURA-
All of those.
-MATT-
The costumes I wore.
-SAM-
I think we all do.
-MATT-
That kind of threw me for a loop.
-LIAM-
The first one we got to the end perfectly.
-TRAVIS-
The stage blood substitutions that you guys had were really ingenious.
-MARISHA-
Well, I thought the inclusion of a musical number was really inspired.
-TRAVIS-
Somebody had to do, right?
-ASHLEY-
That's true. Somebody had to do it.
-MATT-
Well done.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
Check it out this Tuesday, and the VOD, of course, will be available immediately for our Twitch channel subscribers and will be on YouTube on Thursday as usual.
Yeah! (laughter)
-MATT-
Perfect, thank you, Marisha.
-MARISHA-
Nailed it.
-MATT-
Laura, you had something to talk about.
-LAURA-
I did have something to talk about.
-MATT-
Yes, you did!
-LAURA-
In case you guys missed it a few weeks ago, we introduced this Funko Pop!
-TRAVIS-
She's so pretty.
-LAURA-
It's Vex.
-TRAVIS-
She's so pretty on a broom.
-LAURA-
I'm going to take it out of the box.
-SAM-
You're going to unbox it?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I'm going to unbox myself.
-SAM-
It's going to lose half its value.
-LAURA-
So yeah, this-- Ah, she almost fell.
This beauty will be available.
I got to read where it's going to be.
It's going to be available at Best <i>Buy</i>!
-LIAM-
Wow.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
And at funko.com.
-SAM-
You had to read that?
-LAURA-
On July 22, you guys.
-LIAM-
It's going to be at Best...
Buy.
-ASHLEY-
Best <i>Buy</i>.
-LAURA-
Best <i>Buy</i>! That's me! Shut up.
-TRAVIS-
I can't believe you had to read that.
-LAURA-
I didn't believe it.
So there you go.
Check it out.
-MATT-
Fantastic.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
It's a Funko.
-TRAVIS-
She's gorgeous.
-LAURA-
Thanks.
-SAM-
She really is.
-LAURA-
It's got a witch hat, Sam.
-SAM-
I know, I'm so excited about that.
-TRAVIS-
Is she holding a little coin in her hand?
-LAURA-
She's holding a little coin.
-TRAVIS-
She's happy.
-LIAM-
That is funking incredible.
-ASHLEY-
Hey.
-MATT-
And on that note, thank you, Laura.
I believe that brings us to the end of our announcements, and as such, let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

-MATT-
Welcome back.
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein had made their way towards Rumblecusp to prepare for the coming day of Traveler Con.
Upon arriving at the strange island noticing a strange mist and a dreamlike quality to elements of its unexpected topography.
You encountered a village of individuals there from all over Exandria that had a difficult time recalling their pasts, but seemed exuberant and happy with their current day lifestyle here on the island worshiping a fire entity, a god, if you will, that existed within Rumblecusp's volcano itself.
You, after meeting with and staying the night with these individuals, learned a little bit about their culture, learned a little bit about the mystery of where they may have come from and what they do not know or recall, and you chose to go ahead and travel on foot through the jungle path to meet with this Vokodo, this fire god of the island, to ask permission to bring the Traveler and the various other Traveler followers to the island, and you are being accompanied by the spiritual guardian of the village of the people there, Viridian, a druid figure that seems to be the protector of the people there.
You've traveled extensively for hours through the jungle, passed by various dangers, watched as the landscape itself grew darker and strangely colder, dark pits filling the space between the heavy root network and dark tar-like liquid upon which most of you managed to avoid.
Caduceus had not quite so luck twice in a row, falling into the jaws of the creatures that existed within.
Pushing deeper into this darker shaded portion of the jungle and learning about different elements of the island itself being an odd jigsaw puzzle of places that probably shouldn't exist on an island let alone this one.
You came across the sound of something creepy, like a sobbing sound in the distance.
-MARISHA-
It sounded so sad.
-MATT-
I know, and upon going to investigate, Beauregard quietly threw some ball bearings towards the source of this creature and then decided to join it in its sorrow.
Upon which, it seemed a bit perturbed by your presence and began to make itself very aggressively known.
-ASHLEY-
I don't think it was a bad idea.
-MARISHA-
Thank you.
-MATT-
And that is where we left off.
I need you all to roll initiative.
-LAURA-
Like right on?!
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
Ah, jeez.
-TALIESIN-
Gosh darn it.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, ready.
-SAM-
Gosh darn it.
-ASHLEY-
Gosh dandruff.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-SAM-
Oh, we're doing this.
We're going into combat.
I'm going to say that this combat combat cam is powered by Dwarven Forge.
You will not want to miss the new Dwarven Forge Wildlands Kickstarter.
Join their mailing list as soon as it launches, dwarvenforge.com/wildlands.
(exclaiming)
-TRAVIS-
Look how good it looks!
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it looks so good!
-TRAVIS-
It looks so good! Oh, there are tar pools.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, is that what that is?
-MATT-
Yep, those are the various pools of that tar-like liquid.
-LIAM-
What Caduceus kept getting his foot stuck in.
-MARISHA-
Just like the La Brea Tar Pits. Yes!
-TRAVIS-
They're kind of sentient.
-ASHLEY-
We'll go there some time.
-MARISHA-
Steve can tell us all about it.
-LAURA-
-- in the bottom.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.
-MATT-
Now, the rest of you are who are holding back for the time being, where abouts are you standing?
-LAURA-
I don't know, which way did we come from?
-TRAVIS-
Which direction were we coming, towards you?
-MATT-
You guys were heading this direction around this way and then began moving this way to investigate where the sound was coming from.
-MARISHA-
Oh, man, he's already base to base with me.
-TRAVIS-
I will-- Does anybody have any--
-LAURA-
Can I be up on the--
-SAM-
No, you go first, Fjord.
-LAURA-
Oh, sorry, yeah, you go first.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'll swing this side.
-MATT-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, down by that pool bank, if I can.
-MATT-
One more down this way?
-TRAVIS-
To your right. Yeah, thank you.
-MATT-
You got it.
-LAURA-
I'll be on this rock on my corner.
-MATT-
Back this way?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I realize putting myself near a pool probably sucks.
-SAM-
No, it's fine.
-LAURA-
Yeah, you can just be pushed right into it.
Pretty awesome.
-TALIESIN-
You got one save, right? You can do one little hop.
-TRAVIS-
I'm part mermaid, it's cool.
-MATT-
All righty.
-SAM-
Can I go, which one is this?
-TALIESIN-
Is that canon?
-SAM-
Can I go near this tree?
-MATT-
Sure, you guys, we'll say, scattered out a little bit as Beauregard began to investigate this.
Most of you guys would probably be on the side.
You would not have had enough time to encircle the entire space.
-TRAVIS-
God, how do we play?
-LIAM-
I will go behind this big thick tree right here.
-MATT-
Right here?
-SAM-
Oh yeah, but we were togetherish, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we were.
-SAM-
It doesn't make sense that we spread out.
So put me closer to Jester.
-MATT-
Okay, so, I'll put you over in this space?
-SAM-
Yeah, near that tree.
Yeah, perfect, great.
That makes more sense.
-MATT-
Caduceus?
-TALIESIN-
Where's Beau?
-LAURA-
Hi, Veth.
-MATT-
Beau is right there.
-SAM-
Oh, hi.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I would've probably been about half way to Beau.
So, well, I would've been on the other side of that pool because fuck those things.
Here, let me.
-MATT-
Where abouts? That's what the laser pointers are for.
-TALIESIN-
See that weird little-- oh god, this is hilarious.
See that little circle?
-MATT-
Right here?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I would've been behind that stone.
-MATT-
Okay, like right there?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, about there.
-MATT-
Okay, Yasha.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so, I feel like I was kind of near Caduceus.
-MATT-
So possibly over on this space?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, so, I'll hang around.
Yeah, I'll hang out by the tar pool.
Why not?
-MATT-
You got it.
It's a little chilly.
-TALIESIN-
Strength saves to get out.
-MARISHA-
You look like everyone's favorite aunt right now.
I love you so much.
(laughter)
-MATT-
That's pretty great.
-ASHLEY-
Listen, the glasses don't work with the outfit, but--
-TRAVIS-
They do, shut up.
-TALIESIN-
Agree to disagree.
-MARISHA-
You definitely teach drama at the local middle school.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-MATT-
All right, 25 to 20.
-SAM-
Yeah, 22.
-MATT-
22, nice.
Veth. All right.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-LIAM-
What medium do you sculpt in?
-TALIESIN-
Papier-mâché.
-SAM-
Papier-mâché, totally.
-MATT-
20 to 15.
-MARISHA-
18.
-TRAVIS-
15.
Oh shit.
-SAM-
Has this--
-ASHLEY-
I had advantage, too.
-SAM-
Well, I'll get to that in a second.
-LAURA-
So that was Nott, Fjord--
-MATT-
14 to 10.
-TRAVIS-
Nott, Beau, Fjord.
-ASHLEY-
13.
-LAURA-
10.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Nott, Beau, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, Nott, Beau, Fjord, Yasha, and then Jester?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Hey, Liam.
-LIAM-
Hi, Tal.
-MATT-
Okay, 10 to five?
-LIAM-
Mighty nine!
-TALIESIN-
Six.
-ASHLEY-
I'm after Fjord?
-LIAM-
Six and nine.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Nice.
-TRAVIS-
Caleb and Caduceus, right?
-SAM-
(stage whisper) That's a sex thing.
-MATT-
All righty, so, top of the round as this strange, elongated, gray, fleshy, undead entity is now faced right in front of Beauregard.
Its rotted shawl that rests over the top part of its torso revealing this kind of sunken head, noseless, these black, eyeless sockets with this strange shine on the inside of them, and this is elongated, howling mouth of darkness right in front going (sucking gasp).
Veth, you're up first.
-SAM-
It hasn't made an aggressive move yet, right?
-MATT-
Not yet.
-TRAVIS-
I can barely see.
-SAM-
I'm far away.
-MATT-
But it's aggressive in the sense that it just (swishes) appeared right in front of Beauregard.
-SAM-
That's scary, but Beauregard is the coolest.
So I'm going to play it safe, and (startles) I'm going to cast Spider Climb on myself--
-ASHLEY-
Nice.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
-- and scurry up that tree next to me.
-MATT-
You got it. Is that concentration?
-SAM-
Probably. Why, was I doing something else?
-MATT-
No, I'm just--
-SAM-
It says touch.
It does not say-- oh, it is concentration, yes.
-MATT-
Okay. I'm just putting that on there for you there.
All righty.
-SAM-
Scurry up that tree and if I can, bonus action, sort of hide in those-- the foliage.
-MATT-
I'll allow it. Go for it.
Go ahead and roll a stealth check for me, if you don't mind.
Halfling's too tiny.
-SAM-
27.
-MATT-
You're pretty hidden.
-SAM-
And then I will wait.
I'm looking at Beau to see if she looks scared or--
-MARISHA-
No.
-SAM-
She's fine, she's fine.
I'm ready.
-MATT-
Okay, you got it.
So you're holding your action just in case something--
-SAM-
There is no action to hold.
I'm just waiting.
-MATT-
Oh, that's right because you cast, so you're just waiting.
All right, so, on the initiative count 20, you watch as these little flickering flames kind of (whooshing thumps) out of the black, tar-like substances around, and these strange, little, eerie, blue flame lights begin to rise out.
These faint, little, bobbing, blue flames.
-ASHLEY-
Well, that's not a good sign.
-LAURA-
Like little will-o'-wisps?
-MATT-
Something like that, you could say.
-TRAVIS-
They're farts underneath the water.
-TALIESIN-
More like kill-o'-wisps, am I right?
-LAURA-
(laughs exaggeratedly) That's the best one you've ever had, Caduceus.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I'm ashamed of myself.
-MATT-
They then immediately begin to drift towards the nearest source of life.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Like will-o'-wisps.
-LAURA-
Uh-oh.
-MARISHA-
That's great.
-LAURA-
Uh-oh.
-TRAVIS-
Source of light or life? Because I'm kind of dark inherently.
-SAM-
(laughs) Just your personality?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
You're super dark.
-TRAVIS-
So moody.
-MATT-
So as part of that.
Against you, Fjord, it's going to go ahead and attempt to (swooshes) dart in your direction, like, towards your shoulder area, like it's about to just butt in towards your torso.
-TRAVIS-
(yells)
-MATT-
Ooh, that's a 24 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
That definitely hits.
-MATT-
All righty, you take 13 points of lightning damage as it shocks you.
-SAM-
Lightning!
-MATT-
It comes into contact with you and as it does, this jolt arcs through your body as a bit of your life force seems to have been (puffs) pulled out from the impact.
-TRAVIS-
Let me give it to you. (shuddering yell)
-MATT-
There you go, perfect.
Thank you.
-MARISHA-
Nice.
-MATT-
The one moving towards you, Yasha.
That's going to be a 19 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
That'll gif well.
-ASHLEY-
(blows) 19 hits.
-MATT-
All righty.
You take eight points of lightning damage as it also swoops in towards your body, and you try and move out of the way, and you technically dodge its impact, but it's about a foot away and, still, these arcs of lightning (sizzles) arc off of it and blast to your body, and you feel your muscles tense from the pain as you pull away and the sparks dissipate.
-TRAVIS-
No saves, by the way.
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
Caduceus.
-SAM-
Those were just a melee attack.
-MARISHA-
Lightning attack.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's rolling to hit you.
-TALIESIN-
I don't think I'm next.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's right, yeah.
-MATT-
No, it's attacking you--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, okay, that's fine.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 17 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
That misses.
-MATT-
It does, nice! So as this one now comes towards you, you bring the shield up and the electricity actually arcs off the exterior metal parts of the shield.
It absorbs it, no actual damage done to you.
-TALIESIN-
I can't use one of the Shield-- boy, I'm out of it-- Shield of Retribution on this?
-MATT-
If you'd like to. If you have the ability to do so.
-LAURA-
You're coordinating so well right now, Taliesin.
-TALIESIN-
Sure.
-MATT-
Beau, you're on deck, by the way.
-LAURA-
The hair and his shirt and his backdrop.
-LIAM-
Backdrop.
-TALIESIN-
"When a creature misses you with a melee attack--" It's not a melee attack, is it? Or is it? Was that a melee attack?
-MATT-
It was, yes.
-TALIESIN-
So I use my reaction to blast him with arcane force.
You get 4d6 damage.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh!
-MATT-
All right, go ahead and roll damage.
-SAM-
That's hardcore.
-TALIESIN-
It's pretty cool, it's pretty cool.
There we are.
-LAURA-
I think these are undead.
-MATT-
This is force damage, you said, right?
-TALIESIN-
Arcane-- force damage.
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
So that's (counting)--
-TRAVIS-
Sure feels like a good candidate.
-TALIESIN-
14 points of force damage.
-MATT-
14 points.
-TALIESIN-
And a strength saving throw.
-MATT-
Strength saving throw.
It rolled a natural 20--
-ALL-
Ooh!
-MATT-
-- but with the modifier, it's a 15.
-SAM-
It has a negative five?
-TALIESIN-
That's my spell save, right? Spell save is 17.
-MATT-
Is there not one put on the shield?
-TALIESIN-
That's actually a good question.
Hold on.
No, a strength saving throw or be pushed.
Oh wait-- no.
-MATT-
Okay, if you can't find one, for now we'll use yours.
So, yeah, we'll say it works.
-TALIESIN-
Pushed 20 feet away from me.
-MATT-
All right, so it gets pushed.
-TRAVIS-
Look how pretty those trees are, you guys.
-MATT-
It jams into the tree behind and vanishes inside of it before slowly emerging from the outer side, right below where Nott is.
-TALIESIN-
Jerk.
-ASHLEY-
Nice.
-MATT-
All righty, now, Beau, it is your turn.
-MARISHA-
Okay, so this thing just--
-MATT-
At the top of your turn,
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-oh.
-MATT-
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
-MARISHA-
Why?
-TRAVIS-
Because it's got a big ol' mouth.
-LIAM-
Yep,
-SAM-
Oh, no.
-MATT-
Because you are now staring directly into its gaping face.
-TRAVIS-
Really, that's the problem?
-LIAM-
It's kind of depressing to look at.
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's real bad, seven.
-MATT-
Seven!
-SAM-
But can't you do monk stuff?
-MATT-
Oh no.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no!
-MATT-
You guys watch as Beauregard puts her fists up, looks into its face, and her eyes go white, and she drops to the ground, unconscious.
-TRAVIS-
No!
-ASHLEY-
What?!
-LIAM-
You just dropped.
-TRAVIS-
Unconscious?!
-MATT-
You're at zero hit points.
-TRAVIS-
My dope monk shit can't fix that.
-SAM-
Oh shit.
-ASHLEY-
What?
-SAM-
Is she rolling death saves or she's just out and stable? We don't know?
-MATT-
You don't know.
-SAM-
We don't know.
-MATT-
So, Beau, it's the end of your turn.
I need you to roll a death saving throw.
-MARISHA-
Well, that answered the question.
-SAM-
Well, that answered that.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Death save, 12.
-MATT-
12, okay.
That's one success on you there.
Fjord, you're up.
Yasha, you're on deck.
-MARISHA-
This is the last time I try to relate to somebody.
-TRAVIS-
Don't you come to me that fast! All right.
I will run over to Beau, use all 30 feet to get on over there.
-MATT-
(counting)
-SAM-
Does that thing get to attack him or anything?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, so I get a attack of opportunity from the flame?
-MATT-
Yes, it does.
It gets one strike on you as a reaction.
That is going to be a 12 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
That misses!
-MATT-
Yep.
(whooshes) Manage to just avoid the arc's energy, (sizzles) goes across the ground, and you dodge right out of the way as you rush around and head towards Beauregard.
-TRAVIS-
I see Beau fall to the ground, and I go into a baseball slide, and I slide across the ground, and I place a hand on her, and I'll do Lay on Hands--
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
Fuck, yes.
-TRAVIS-
-- and restore two hit points.
-MATT-
Okay, there you go.
Hey, that's conscious.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MARISHA-
I'll take it.
-LIAM-
Just a defibrillator.
Can't say that word.
-TRAVIS-
That's my action, as my bonus action, I'll look up and cast Hexblade's Curse right in its face.
-MATT-
Right on its face, you got it.
-TRAVIS-
On the thing, yeah.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
As you, on the ground, you see Beauregard (gasping) come to life with a deep breath.
As you turn your hand back towards it, you see its face.
It's already put into shadow, these little green veins begin to reach up inside, glowing the underside of its neck, and that represents your Hexblade's Curse.
The element of the Wild Mother drawing into its necrotic presence to dig deeper into its body.
-TRAVIS-
Is it just darkness in its mouth?
-MATT-
Yeah, it's just a void of darkness.
-LAURA-
That's terrifying.
-MATT-
That finish your turn, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
It does.
Yeah, it's my max move.
-MATT-
Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so, I'm going to run over to Beau.
-MATT-
Okay, up to just to back of her, or--?
-ASHLEY-
I kind of-- Let me go to where I could maybe also attack?
-MATT-
Yeah, you have the enough movement to do that with Beauregard over here.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
Plus I have Mobile, too.
-MATT-
There, yeah, we got two people with 50 speed movement.
It's crazy.
The will-o'-wisp does get an attack of opportunity on you as you dart out of its space.
Ooh, wow, that's a 21 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You take 11 points of lightning damage as you feel it hit you from behind, but you just grit your teeth and keep running.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to lean down to Beau and use Healing Hands on her, which will heal you for 12 hit points.
-SAM-
What, what is this?
-TRAVIS-
It's not a competition, okay?
-ASHLEY-
It's a competition.
(laughter) Okay, so--
-MARISHA-
Oh, yeah, keep tapping me.
-ASHLEY-
And then-- do I-- bonus attack.
I'm going to attack it.
-LAURA-
(singing Yakety Sax)
-MATT-
Your Healing Hands is an action?
-ASHLEY-
It's an action.
-MATT-
So you have no action to attack.
-ASHLEY-
I can't do that, that's fine.
I'm going to just hover over Beau.
-MATT-
Okay, you still have a bonus action if you want to do anything.
-LAURA-
(whispering) Can you rage?
-TRAVIS-
I think you can rage as a bonus, right?
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, thank you.
I'm going to rage.
-MATT-
Okay, there you go. I know it's been a while.
♪ It's been a while ♪
-TRAVIS-
I got you, fam.
-MATT-
All righty, so,
-ASHLEY-
Thanks, guys.
-MATT-
So as you get up, now both Fjord and Yasha flanking Beauregard staring at this creature, you feel the adrenaline surge through your system, and your eyes narrow, your teeth grit.
-TRAVIS-
Being able to get the fuck out of here.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It's now the creature's turn, if you're done.
-LAURA-
Oh, god.
-TRAVIS-
Cool, all three of us, hey.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'm done.
-MATT-
The creature now hasn't really moved its head from where Beauregard dropped.
As you guys moved in, it still stood there, still.
Okay. Its head turns in one rapid motion.
You don't even see the transition.
Its head is just suddenly facing forward.
-LAURA-
Oh, no, I hate that.
-MATT-
I need you to make--
-LAURA-
That's Ring girl shit.
-MATT-
-- a constitution saving throw for me, Fjord.
-SAM-
That's Travis' favorite.
-MARISHA-
It's going to be bad.
-TRAVIS-
That's actually not terrible.
That's cocked.
-MATT-
Cocked, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Ugh. Terrible, nine.
-MATT-
Nine. As you look into its open mouth, you hear this horrible sucking sound that gets higher pitched, and as it does, all of the world around you just goes dark, and you feel this horrible burning sound as something is pulled from you from the inside.
You suffer--
-SAM-
Not dead, not dead.
-MATT-
Let's see here.
-ASHLEY-
What the heck is this thing?
-LAURA-
I hate it.
-ASHLEY-
Me, too!
-TRAVIS-
Less dice, please. Less dice, small number.
I am friend.
-MATT-
48 points of necrotic damage.
-TRAVIS-
(splutters) (laughter)
-MATT-
As your vision goes into this dark tunnel and then returns, your whole body is pulsing with intense pain rooted deep in your system that you haven't felt before, and you feel like a part of you is just gone.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) I'm just sad.
-SAM-
We avoided a dragon turtle, and we just walked up to this one.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Bet it changed your max hit points.
-MATT-
It just stands there, looking at Fjord still.
It doesn't look afraid, it's not moving.
It's just waiting for you to come to it.
That brings us to Jester's turn.
Caleb, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
We need to get the fuck out.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, we should just go.
-SAM-
Jessie, you're up.
-LAURA-
I just thought of something, and it's so not appropriate and I want to do it.
-MATT-
Do it.
-LAURA-
No, because everybody's in danger.
-MATT-
That's the best time to do something inappropriate.
-LAURA-
I'm going to run forward and get in front of Caduceus so I'm within 30 feet.
-MATT-
25, 30, you can't quite get in front of him.
You can get over here, maybe, but you'll be in melee with the will-o'-wisp.
-LAURA-
That's okay.
-MATT-
You have to get over the trunk to get over there, anyway.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So you can get there.
-LAURA-
Okay, hold on because this-- oh, god.
This changes what I was going to do.
This is dumb.
-SAM-
Use Vex's broom to fly over there.
-LAURA-
Zoom! Hold on.
-SAM-
Dumb is the best, do dumb.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) I love the check in, like the visual look of "Hey, is this okay?" We don't know what it is.
(laughter)
"It's okay, right?" What is it?
-MATT-
What you got, Laura?
-SAM-
While she's thinking, we must admire your shirt for a moment.
-LAURA-
This is so stupid! I'm going to try to use the Wand of Smiles on it.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay, all right, all right.
-MARISHA-
I am so here for this.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
What's the saving throw it has to make?
-MARISHA-
It feels adjacent to what I was doing.
-LAURA-
Oh god, oh no, that's so terrible! It's a low save! It's a real low save!
-MATT-
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it.
-LAURA-
I'm not going to do it!
-SAM-
Do it!
-LAURA-
No, I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to Turn Undead.
I'm going to Destroy Undead.
-MATT-
Okay, all right.
-LAURA-
I have no idea if these are undead.
-MATT-
The save on that is?
-LAURA-
17.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
That's cocked.
That's a nine.
-LAURA-
Oh, then they fail it.
-MATT-
They do.
-LAURA-
Are they undead?
-MATT-
It is undead, yes.
But at what--
-LAURA-
At-- okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Wait, but there was a but.
-MATT-
Well, the Destroy Undead itself has a specific--
-LAURA-
Destroy Undead happens if it's a-- two or lower.
-LIAM-
Challenge Rating.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's much higher DC that that,
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
But it does turn it.
-LAURA-
Yes, I don't know if the will-o'-wisp thingies are undead either, but anything within 30 feet of me.
-MATT-
Within 30 feet of you? So the one that's right in front of you.
-LIAM-
You turned the big one?
-TALIESIN-
There's a couple.
-MATT-
And there's one that's underneath Veth.
So they will both make saves--
-TRAVIS-
Had a little too many vegetables.
-MATT-
-- and both fail!
-LAURA-
Okay! That's something.
-TALIESIN-
What's their Challenge Rating?
-MATT-
Those wisps, you watch as the two flames that are flickering there-- (poof) and the lights are snuffed.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
All right, all right.
-TALIESIN-
So this thing on its turn--
-TRAVIS-
Away?
-TALIESIN-
Full fucking speed away from us.
-SAM-
I broke my feet.
-TRAVIS-
Away from Jester or all of us?
-TALIESIN-
Away from Jester.
-LAURA-
Away from me.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh, this island's fucking weird.
-SAM-
Did the big bad take any damage?
-LAURA-
He got turned but he didn't get destroyed.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, he's going to run.
-TRAVIS-
Somebody turned the power off to the island, and the dinosaurs are running amok.
(laughter)
-MATT-
So that finish your turn, Jester? That was your movement, your action, you have a bonus still.
-LAURA-
For my bonus action, can I do a spell?
-MATT-
Yeah, because Channel Divinity is not a spell.
-TRAVIS-
Somebody find Dennis Nedry.
-LAURA-
Oh, great, then I'm going to--
-MARISHA-
UNIX! I know this.
-LAURA-
For my bonus action, I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon at 4th-level, so it's got my serrated lollipop.
-MATT-
Slick, and we'll put it right on the other, next to Fjord?
-LAURA-
I'm going to put it-- yeah, next to the guy.
-TRAVIS-
♪ I'm going to make your lollipop ♪
-LAURA-
But I want to look and see if I hit him, does it break the turn undead? It's not like that, it's not like a charm.
-TALIESIN-
I don't think it does.
I think there's nothing, it's just run no matter what.
-LAURA-
It's just got it.
So I'm going to try to hit him.
-MATT-
Let me double check on that one.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
♪ I'mma take you to the candy shop. ♪
-LAURA-
"If the creature fails its saving throw against turn undead--"
-MATT-
Turns for one minute, or until it takes any damage.
-LAURA-
"-- or until it takes any damage." Okay, okay, okay.
So I'll just protect my friends with my spiritual weapon, but I won't hit it.
-MATT-
Okay, there you go.
That finishes Jester's turn.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MATT-
Caleb, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.
-TRAVIS-
High five.
-LIAM-
Are there any of the glowing blue balls left?
-MATT-
None that you can see.
-LIAM-
Shoot, so, I'm behind this tree.
I saw none of that.
I don't know what's going on.
So he would step out diagonally to his right to see what is going on.
-MATT-
You look over here, and you can immediately see there is Beauregard on the ground, eyes open and just getting up to her elbows from a prone position.
Yasha and Fjord both there facing off with this creature, Jester's spiritual weapon apparates in the air, but isn't taking any notion yet, and that's all you see.
-LIAM-
Okay, so seeing that and calculating very quickly, I will start muttering and take a bite of licorice root and cast Haste on Beauregard.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MATT-
Okay, gotcha.
So, Beau, you are hasted.
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-MATT-
We'll put a blue one on you.
That's fun.
-MARISHA-
That's speed times two?
-MATT-
Speed times two.
-LIAM-
Your AC goes up.
-MATT-
By two.
-LIAM-
You get an extra action.
-MATT-
I think advantage on dex saves? Is that how it works?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
And yeah, the extra action for a single attack or anything else you want to try.
-LIAM-
Plus two to AC.
-MARISHA-
Plus two to AC.
-LIAM-
Advantage on dex saves.
-MARISHA-
Oh, yes, you're the best.
-LIAM-
Additional action on each turn.
-MATT-
You got it.
So that's 10 feet of movement.
-LIAM-
"The action can be used only to take the attack, dash, disengage, hide--" Yeah, 10 feet of movement, and I'll go back behind the tree.
-TRAVIS-
I love playing this fucking game.
Look at these guys.
-LIAM-
76 hit points, everybody.
-TRAVIS-
It's so great.
-MATT-
All right, Caduceus, you're up.
At the beginning of your turn,
-MARISHA-
Oh, I can do this.
I can do this.
-MATT-
I need you to make a constitution saving throw for me, please.
-LAURA-
Caduceus, why Caduceus?
-TRAVIS-
Because he can see it?
-MATT-
You glance past and you can see into its eyes.
You can see this dark black hole--
-TALIESIN-
Can it do that even when under Turn Undead?
-MATT-
Yeah, it's not-- It's not an action it takes.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, It's just a thing.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-TALIESIN-
20.
-SAM-
Oh wow.
-MATT-
Okay, all right.
-TALIESIN-
I think I do take half damage or something like that.
-LIAM-
You're going to be okay.
-LAURA-
We're going to be fine, we're going to be fine.
-MATT-
Okay, so nothing happens.
You're fine.
You do gather, as you pull your eyes away from it for a second, that there is something about its gaze, something about its eyes and that connection that tried to reach into your soul and you just managed to shrug it off.
So what are you doing with your turn?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to yell at everybody: Don't look at its eyes, don't look at its eyes! Don't look in there, oh man.
-MARISHA-
It's his mouth.
His eyes were very pretty.
It's his mouth.
-TALIESIN-
And let's see--
-TRAVIS-
You got a purdy mouth.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
You got a purdy mouth.
-MATT-
That's the best post-date conversation.
It's not the eyes, it's the mouth.
-TALIESIN-
And I'm going to cast Bless at 3rd-level--
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
-- for myself, Beau, Fjord, Jester, and Yasha. Just everyone who's in the thick of it.
-SAM-
Smart, smart.
-ASHLEY-
What is it?
-TALIESIN-
You get an extra d4 on--
-MATT-
Attacks and saving throws.
-TALIESIN-
-- attacks and saves.
-MATT-
Okay, so who was it? Yasha, Beau, and who else?
-TALIESIN-
Myself, Yasha, Beau, Fjord, Jester.
Everyone who's in the midst.
-TRAVIS-
What did we get?
-ASHLEY-
Thanks, Caduceus.
-LAURA-
Blessed.
-TRAVIS-
Blessed.
Plus four to?
-LAURA-
Attacks and saving throws.
-TALIESIN-
I think we should run.
I think we should run, and I'm going to start backing off.
-MATT-
At this point, all right.
That finishes your turn?
-TALIESIN-
Unless, yeah, I want to move a little further away from this thing.
I want to be about-- Actually, yeah, I'm just going to move five feet to the left, 10 feet to the left.
-MATT-
All right, this way?
-TALIESIN-
The other left, sorry,
-MATT-
There you go.
-TALIESIN-
Then maybe back a bit if there's not a puddle there.
I can't quite see.
-MATT-
You can get right there, and then before that, you start getting in to puddle territory.
-TALIESIN-
Let me stay on the rocks.
That's a little close.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Can I stay on the rocks?
-MATT-
All right, there you go.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Stay on the rocks ♪
-LAURA-
♪ Stay on the rocks ♪
-MATT-
Ending your turn, Viridian, the druid who's been traveling with you, comes rushing up from the side where you guys were to see this scenario.
-TRAVIS-
Step up.
-MATT-
And goes--
-SAM-
Do something, lady!
-MATT-
"The specter, it's too far south.
This isn't right." You see her pull back.
She's going to go ahead and--
-MARISHA-
A specterecter?
-LIAM-
Specter.
-MATT-
She calls it the specter.
-LAURA-
It's like a thing they know about.
-TRAVIS-
<i>The</i> specter.
-MATT-
You watch as she puts a hand up, and as she clenches her fist, clouds begin to (rumbles) roil in the sky above, and then she brings her hand down to the ground like that.
You watch as one bolt of energy goes (sizzles) out of this cloud and slams into the creature.
-LAURA-
Oh, motherfuck.
-MARISHA-
Oh, now we're fighting. (laughs)
-SAM-
Oh, good!
-TRAVIS-
I think we're fighting.
-LIAM-
I like to think of that in character in the moment.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
"Oh, motherfuck."
-ASHLEY-
Ah, motherfuck.
-MARISHA-
Oh, we're fighting!
-MATT-
It does make its save.
-TALIESIN-
Damn it.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Inspector Gadget ♪
-MATT-
You could always try it again, and, unfortunately, she was not present for that shout.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
All right, so, that is 3d10.
-TRAVIS-
3d10.
-MATT-
All right, so, it takes some lightning damage.
You see it move quickly.
It's been standing there this whole time.
As soon as the bolt of energy comes, it looks up (gasps) and seems to dart to the side and it impacts right to side of the creature.
It still shocks it, but it manages to reduce the damage that it took.
So it took a little bit.
All right, top of the round now.
Veth, you're up.
-SAM-
Sorry.
-LAURA-
Did you just burp or something?
-MARISHA-
Are you going to barf?
-SAM-
No, there's something wrong with my flask.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-SAM-
I don't think I cleaned it real well last week.
-MATT-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
But I've been watching you sip it this whole time.
-LAURA-
Do not drink from it anymore tonight, Sam.
-MATT-
Did you get a chunk?
-SAM-
It's a little rough.
Maybe I should--
-TALIESIN-
Should've gotten smooth instead of the chunky, man.
-SAM-
Maybe I should go slow. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Dude, if you poop your pants at the table, that would be amazing.
-LIAM-
Just one episode.
One out of hundreds of episodes.
-TRAVIS-
Just gamble on a fart and let it happen.
-LAURA-
Do not drink from it.
-SAM-
It's not right, it's not right.
Something's not right.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Speaking of not right, Veth, it is your turn.
-MARISHA-
I've never seen you this panicked.
-SAM-
I know, it's never tasted this bad before.
-MATT-
Even the live show with the old Scanlan-- never mind.
-SAM-
That one was better.
-LAURA-
Oh, god.
-TRAVIS-
That made my stomach hurt.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, your pain isn't funny, but I'm laughing.
-SAM-
Okay, okay. (Veth-like yells) Um... I'm going to-- Am I on a branch-- I mean, I spider climbed up.
-MATT-
Yeah, so, you're standing on the side of it.
You're hiding amongst the various branches and thick foliage.
-SAM-
Can I grab onto a branch?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
In case I lose my spiders.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
And I will take out a bit of-- if I can one-handed, or I guess with a finger, I'll take out a bit of fur and rub it in my hand and touch the bolt in my awesome crossbow, and I will aim it and cast <i>Brenatto's</i> Voltaic Bolt.
-ASHLEY-
What?
-SAM-
And I will fire my cross<i>bow</i> at the creature.
-MATT-
Go for and roll an attack.
-ASHLEY-

-LAURA-
What is it, what is it?
-SAM-
A dramatic 12.

-MATT-
A total 12?
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
You are hidden, so you have advantage on it.
-SAM-
Oh, thank god.
(laughter) Okay, way better, 23.
-MARISHA-
Are you blessed?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
I'm not blessed.
-TALIESIN-
Not blessed.
-MATT-
23 does hit.
-SAM-
Okay, 23 hits.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Sam is blessed, clearly.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, of course.
-SAM-
I will-- it's sneak attack damage.

Where's my thing? Sorry, so much math.
31 points of damage plus the extra lighting damage.
That's another 13 points of damage, 44 points of damage.
-MATT-
44 points of damage to it.
-ASHLEY-
Damn, okay.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
How do you want to do this?
-MATT-
No, but you do watch--
-ASHLEY-
Howdy doody do dis.
-MATT-
-- as you are hanging from the branch below, you cast the spell, grab the branch, fire it.
There's this (shushes) streak of energy that encircles the exterior front of the bolt thrower as it (shushes) fires of.
The creature is standing there (gasps, thunk) looks over in your direction temporarily, and then the bolt (crackles) shocks from the inside.
For a brief second, you see this flash in the deep, deep, dark parts of its socket where is the energy filtered through it, and it (groans) leans forward and the smoke pours out of its mouth and its eyes.
That was a healthy chunk of damage on it.
-LAURA-
Yay!
-SAM-
Okay, good, good, good.
-MATT-
All right, are you going to stay put or--?
-SAM-
I'm going to stay put.
-MATT-
All right, you got it.
-SAM-
Hanging on a tree.
-MATT-
The last will-o'-wisp is going to take its turn now.
-ASHLEY-
(breathy) Will-o'-wisp.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
25, 30, the closest life source to it is Fjord.
So it's going to go ahead and shift towards Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Damn it.
-MATT-
It's going to attempt to strike you--
-TRAVIS-
All right.
-MATT-
-- for 11.
-TRAVIS-
That misses!
-MATT-
Yep, you see it coming out of the way, and you duck as it just glides overhead and is now floating just slightly above you right now, the flames (fluttering) hovering.
-LAURA-
All the little tabs on Beau right now.
Poor Beau.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Get off! No!
-MARISHA-
(yelling)
-MATT-
Beauregard, it's your turn.
-LIAM-
Get these hula hoops off of me.
-TRAVIS-
We better get out of here.
-MATT-
Beauregard, it's your turn.
Fjord, you're on deck.
What are you doing on your turn?
-MARISHA-
I guess we're fighting.
So I'm going to stand up.
-LIAM-
Hasted.
-MARISHA-
Hasted.
-MATT-
You are hasted.
-MARISHA-
And I'm going to-- staring at it and scream.
I'm going to-- is the bolt Nott fired still in there?
-MATT-
It is. Are you looking towards the creature?
-MARISHA-
No, I'm just sitting up and I'm looking towards the bolt, and this is a-- fuck ghosts, and I'm going to pop pop.
And I'm going to use the bolt.
-SAM-
Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool.
-LAURA-
Cool, cool.
-MATT-
You got it.
So you're averting your gaze?
-MARISHA-
(unsure) Yes.
-MATT-
Okay.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I'm looking at its stomach and not its dank mouth.
-MATT-
Just wanted to confirm.
-LIAM-
Caduceus warned us.
-MATT-
Based on Caduceus' warning...
-TRAVIS-
Spoon fed.
-LIAM-
Shouted it out.
-MARISHA-
I already did this once.
-MATT-
I understand.
All right, so, you go ahead and make your attacks on it.
Because you are averting your gaze, your attacks are with disadvantage.
-MARISHA-
What? Oh.
-TALIESIN-
But you add a d4.
-MARISHA-
Okay, yeah.
-SAM-
Yeah, that makes sense.
-MARISHA-
Pop pop. I'm going to try and just go and just beat the bolt further in it.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-MARISHA-
I don't know, disadvantage with a d4-- oh, yucky.
That's bad.
Well. Four, five, six, seven. 17?
-MATT-
17 hits.
-MARISHA-
I love you. Hugs!
-TALIESIN-
I love you.
-MARISHA-
(exclaims) Okay, no, I wasn't expecting-- I don't know what to do now.
Okay, hang on, d8.
Okay, nine damage, right? Yeah, that's what-- nine!
-MATT-
Nine damage, all righty.
-MARISHA-
Sorry, I wasn't expecting to hit.
Pop pop again.
That's both 16s plus three.
So, nine, 29.
-MATT-
29 hits.
-MARISHA-
Best <i>Buy</i>.
-LAURA-
Jesus.
-ASHLEY-
Best <i>Buy</i>!
-MARISHA-
11 damage, great.
-LIAM-
Best Buy, July 15th.
-LAURA-
July 22nd.
-MARISHA-
I have another action? So I'm going to pop pop again.
-MATT-
Well, it's a single attack.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I'm going to single attack again.
-MATT-
So, pop pop, pop.
-LIAM-
I want to hold it so bad.
-MARISHA-
Pop pop, pop.
-LAURA-
I know.
-MARISHA-
11 plus...
one.
So, 12, 22?
-MATT-
22 hits.
-MARISHA-
13 damage.
-MATT-
All righty.
Okay?
-MARISHA-
Flurry of Beaus.
-MATT-
Go for it. Two more strikes.
-MARISHA-
I'm just punching through its abdomen.
-MATT-
You're just Ip Manning it.
-MARISHA-
Just fuck this ghost.
-SAM-
Ghost punch.
-MARISHA-
Still at disadvantage, yeah?
-LAURA-
Aim for his dick!
-MARISHA-
Okay, I hear that, and I start for his balls--
-TRAVIS-
Speed bagging?
-MARISHA-
-- where his balls would be.
-TALIESIN-
Speed bagging.
-MARISHA-
Ooh, yucky, that's a natural one.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
Ooh.
Well, this makes sense because there are no balls there.
As you go to swing, (whooshes) it's smooth as a Ken doll.
-MARISHA-
Wrong direction! He has no dick! I shout.
-MATT-
This man has no dick.
-MARISHA-
And... (laughs) (laughter) Pop pop.
-SAM-
More popping?
-MATT-
You have one more attack.
-MARISHA-
Huh?
-MATT-
You have one more attack.
-MARISHA-
I have one more attack?
-MATT-
Your Flurry of Blows was two more strikes, right?
-MARISHA-
Yes, yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, so you have one more.
-MARISHA-
But I did my bonus attack, right?
-MATT-
Correct. You did--
-MARISHA-
Was just this.
-MATT-
-- your first two attacks, then your bonus attack--
-MARISHA-
Which just missed.
-MATT-
-- and then you did Flurry of Blows, which is two more.
-MARISHA-
So, two more attacks.
-MATT-
Correct, well, you just did one.
-ASHLEY-
Damn! That is so crazy.
-LIAM-
Was one of those the hasted attack?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, one of them was a hasted one because I haven't done my Flurry of Beaus yet.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Right?
-MATT-
You did nine, 11, 13 damage, but then you missed on one attack.
So that's four attacks you've gone through.
-MARISHA-
Okay, so, last pop.
-MATT-
Yeah, this is the last one.
-MARISHA-
That's better.
17?
-MATT-
17 hits.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
And that's an eight for a beautiful 13.
-MATT-
13 points of damage, great.
-MARISHA-
And then--
-SAM-
Two more attacks.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
I--
-LAURA-
And then I'm going to fly 120 feet.
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
100 episodes later.
-TRAVIS-
Always.
-MARISHA-
So I can spend my Mind of Mercury to buy-- no, that's a reaction.
Never mind, never mind.
I will-- I have a bonus action?
-MATT-
No, you've already use that for your Flurry.
-MARISHA-
Okay, right, I'm done.
-MATT-
You're done, okay.
End of your turn, because this is something that I should have been keeping track of, but have not.
After the impact of the attacks from Beauregard (thumping) (groaning) you watch as the air around it grows dark at the end of your turn, and all of a sudden, everyone in proximity just feels like more of their life force being yanked out of their body.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
What is the proximity?
-MATT-
Yes, Beauregard, Yasha, and Fjord...
-TALIESIN-
All with a d4.
-MATT-
There's no save here.
You all take eight points of necrotic damage from just the surrounding dark aura around it.
-ASHLEY-
But I'm resistant to necrotic.
-MATT-
So you take four.
-ASHLEY-
So I take four.
-LAURA-
Marisha, were you adding a four to all of those attacks? Because you're blessed.
-MATT-
No, she was.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
In fact, one of them hit only because of that.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MARISHA-
Attack and saves, yes.
-ASHLEY-
Girl, you're blessed.
-LAURA-
Because, girl, you're blessed.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
I'm on it.
-MATT-
Finishing Beau's turn.
Fjord, you're up, Yasha, you're on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, (humming).
I am going to summon the Star Razor and activate it,
-MATT-
All right (shushes) the sword appears in your hand.
-SAM-
Star Razor activate!
-TRAVIS-
And I will cast Banishing Smite as a bonus action at 5th-level.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TRAVIS-
And I will take two strikes against this thing, not looking at it, with disadvantage.
-MATT-
Okay, so, averting your gaze, you do take disadvantage on those strikes.
Go for it, first attack.
-TALIESIN-
And you get a d4, which I will say every time no matter who's doing what.
-MATT-
Yeah, man.
No, cleric's about being Clippy the Clip.
-TALIESIN-
It's just going to keep happening.
-TRAVIS-
Plus four or a d4?
-TALIESIN-
d4.
-MATT-
Plus a d4.
-TRAVIS-
Plus a d4, okay.
So-- hold on.
It's been a second. Attack.
Plus two is 14.
-LAURA-
Wish we knew what his strengths and weaknesses were.
-MATT-
That's a d6 you just rolled. d4.
-SAM-
Well, we know that it doesn't have a dick.
-LIAM-
I'm going to guess necrotic not good against it.
-TRAVIS-
What's a d4 look like? It's a triangle, right?
-MATT-
It's the pyramid, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Do I not have a fucking pyramid?
-MATT-
Did it get lost in the shuffle?
-TRAVIS-
Throw me a pyramid.
-LAURA-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Throw me a d4.
-MATT-
Laura, you do it, since you guys are--
-SAM-
You can touch.
-MATT-
Yeah, you're a pod.
-LAURA-
Ready? Four!
-TRAVIS-
Four.
-MATT-
Yep.
-TRAVIS-
So that is 27 to hit.
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-SAM-
Jesus.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, so, that is 5d10, right, something damage.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Cool, sorry.
-SAM-
Expert level D&amp;D player.
-MATT-
So you rolled damage on the weapon, right?
-TRAVIS-
I rolled damage on the weapon, okay.
-MATT-
Plus your Hexblade's Curse damage.
-TRAVIS-
(like Travis) I've lost my d4 and I don't know what I'm doing.
(laughter)
Holy shit.
Seriously, I am out of it.
-LAURA-
He only has one d4.
-SAM-
I mean, to be fair, I do, too.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, nine plus seven is 16 plus four for Hexblade's Curse.
-TALIESIN-
It's a weird die, to be fair.
-TRAVIS-
So, 20, and then 5d10.
-ASHLEY-
Damn.
-TRAVIS-
Seven, 27.
-SAM-
You want to try my flask, Laura?
-TRAVIS-
31, yes, 38.
-MARISHA-
Were there chunks?
-LIAM-
Could you strain out the--
-TRAVIS-
10, 48.
-SAM-
I think I left some wine in there last time.
-TRAVIS-
51 points of damage.
-SAM-
And it's just vinegar.
-TALIESIN-
What kind of damage?
-TRAVIS-
It's got a fucking thing next to it.
It looks like a comet or a meteor.
-TALIESIN-
Radiant, I think.
-TRAVIS-
Force, and if it drops it below 50 hit points, does it?
-MATT-
How do you want to do this? (cheering)
-TRAVIS-
Damn, I was not anticipating that.
I'll just summon the Razor and then just go like (whimpers and impact) and just take it from collar bone to hip, just diagonal, long cross guard sash.
-MATT-
You guys watch as this large arc of faintly green radiant energy swings off the blade as it converts to a force blast.
As it impacts, the blade doesn't even reach the flesh of the undead creature.
The force of the magic actually begins tearing it apart before the blade can cut into it, and you watch as it just scatters into four or five different pieces.
What looks like rags, now, thrown against the ground and turn to ash crumbling away.
The creature is destroyed.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh! I regain some hit points with that.
-SAM-
Nicely done, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Thank you.
-SAM-
Wait, what about the little will-o'-the-wispies?
-MATT-
Yeah, there is one little will-o'-wisp right next to Fjord.
You have your second attack, if you want.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I do?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Because I started with one melee, I guess I can do one Eldritch Blast, right?
-MATT-
No, your action either is two attacks or it's two Eldritch Blasts-- or three Eldritch Blasts.
-TRAVIS-
It's not-- Is it near me? Oh, it is. He's in my lane.
So I'll spin around and make an attack.
-TALIESIN-
Fly swatter.
-TRAVIS-
I will look at him.
-MATT-
You can do that. (laughs)
-LAURA-
(like wisp) What, why, no, I wasn't.
I was just coming to say hi.
-TRAVIS-
23.
-MATT-
23 hits.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
(high-pitched) Hee hee! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I reroll ones.
Four plus seven is 11.
-MATT-
11 points of damage to that one.
-LIAM-
(like wisp) You don't want to hit me.
-TRAVIS-
And I regain-- Man, this shit's all over the place.
I regain 15 hit points because the thing on my Hexblade's Curse d-d-died.
-MATT-
It did.
That one, I believe, had already suffered damage, that will-o'-wisp, and so (fluffs).
-LIAM-
(like wisp) I'm so wispy!
-MATT-
That one scatters and a moment of silence falls upon the battlefield here as you all stand ready for the next thing to go ahead and arrive and assail you, and after a moment--
-TALIESIN-
Eyes of the Grave?
-MATT-
Eyes of the Grave. You look around yourself.
You sense that nothing at the moment is challenging the place where you guys are standing.
For the time being, you seem to be somewhat safe.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I think we're pretty cool right now.
-LAURA-
What was that?
-SAM-
What happened? Beauregard, you wandered off, and what the hell was that?
-MARISHA-
It looked sad.
I tried to be nice because it looked sad.
Fuck that shit.
Fuck that, I'm never doing that shit again.
-MATT-
The roiling cloud above fades and Viridian goes, "I'm so sorry.
I don't normally traverse on foot, and it's strange.
This specter, I've not seen, but heard story of, and it's supposed to be from the north and by the Ruin.
Normally, I've not heard of it traveling as far south."
-LAURA-
What could've made it travel?
-MATT-
"I don't know."
-SAM-
Maybe it heard about Traveler Con.
-LAURA-
Beau, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds.
Oh, wait, shit, no.
I don't think I have it prepared.
-TRAVIS-
An early access badge.
-SAM-
Yeah, it wants to go to Traveler Con.
-LAURA-
Shut up, you guys.
-LIAM-
It's like right on speed dial.
-TRAVIS-
How many hit points do you have?
-MARISHA-
Six.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
I got Healing Word.
-TRAVIS-
One of those is mine.
-LIAM-
'Sup, Caleb.
-ASHLEY-
You have six? You should have more.
-LAURA-
No, she got sucked dry a little bit.
-ASHLEY-
You got hit, you got-- never mind.
-LAURA-
Maybe we should take a little rest or something?
-TALIESIN-
Let's maybe find a place that isn't quite so ominous?
-MARISHA-
Caduceus.
-MATT-
"I think that's a good idea."
-MARISHA-
Do I have biceps still? Did I lose my biceps?
-TRAVIS-
Viridian, do you know how much further this
-TALIESIN-
I mean, they're there.
-TRAVIS-
-- particular cesspooly area goes on all the way to the mountain or--?
-MATT-
"No, no, probably another, at most, an hour's worth of travel."
-TRAVIS-
Should we try and get out of the inky black stuff?
-MATT-
"I would recommend that."
-TRAVIS-
Can you make it another hour, Beau? Do you have a potion?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
I do, but I'm fine.
-LAURA-
I'm going to use Healing Word just to be safe, okay?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I was going to throw a Cure Wounds at this, too.
-TRAVIS-
I'll give you another one hit point.
I mean, it's no big, just chill.
-LAURA-
I'm going to Healing Word at 3rd-level for you, Beau.
-MARISHA-
Oh, it's like Icy Hot.
Thank you.
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to do a quick Cure Wounds at a 2nd-level.
-ASHLEY-
I mean, I can only do that once a day, anyways.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, only once a day? Shame.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that's not bad.
-ASHLEY-
You know, it's not my thing.
-TALIESIN-
13 points also.
-SAM-
It was just much more powerful, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Wow, okay.
-MATT-
13, and you have a 3rd-level Healing Word, you said?
-SAM-
And she's not even a magic user.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Some people care about quantity over quality, okay?
-ASHLEY-
That's just like instant 12 points.
You know, I don't even have to--
-SAM-
She doesn't blink or have to cast anything.
-LAURA-
14 points.
-SAM-
She just does it.
-ASHLEY-
It just happens for me.
-TALIESIN-
Just until we find a place to take a short rest.
-LIAM-
They're not doctors, they're EMTs.
They'll get you up real quick, that's it.
-TRAVIS-
We're lifeguards.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yep.
-MATT-
How much is that? Five?
-LAURA-
14.
-MATT-
Oh, 14. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
What is this? How is that--
-LAURA-
Well, I held up four for 14 and then I realized.
-MATT-
Four and then teen.
(laughter) Come on, Travis. Get with it.
-LIAM-
(like Jester) You know.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-LAURA-
I had Oreo in my mouth, okay?
-TRAVIS-
Are we teaching Ronin 14? (laughter)
-LIAM-
(like Jester) You know, 72.
-TALIESIN-
He has 55 fingers, to be fair.
-LIAM-
Viridian, how far are we from that thing's normal haunting grounds in time?
-MATT-
"Two day's travel, at least, on the northern side of the island."
-LAURA-
Does he move fast or is he, like, super slow? That must've taken him a while.
-MATT-
"I mean, I can't tell.
I've not encountered it myself."
-ASHLEY-
Why do you think he was down here? You don't usually see him around?
-MATT-
"No, I've not seen him in my travels, but I normally don't veer from the path to and from the mountain space, itself."
-MARISHA-
Are you sure this is the same one?
-MATT-
"I hope so.
I would hate to think there's more of these on the island.
Nevertheless, I think it's best we move on from this space in case we draw any more of the wisps from the swamp around us."
-TRAVIS-
Agreed.
-MATT-
"Follow me," and you watch as Viridian takes the lead on this one.
What's the marching order going forward following Viridian?
-LIAM-
Caleb takes the center.
-SAM-
Let's put Beau in the middle, too.
She's a little bit--
-TALIESIN-
I'll go in the front.
-MARISHA-
Yasha.
-ASHLEY-
I'll-- Yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm going to, just for as long as my Spiritual Weapon stays up, which isn't much longer, I'm going to just try to eat it.
-MATT-
Okay, sure.
-TALIESIN-
It's more of a lickable object.
-MATT-
It's your Spiritual Weapon, so you describe what happens as you try and lick your bladed lollipop.
-LAURA-
Well, I'm not licking the blades.
I'm licking the middle.
-MATT-
Okay, and it tastes like?
-LAURA-
Strawberries and cotton candy.
-MATT-
Checks out.
-TALIESIN-
I've always imagined that the blades were retractable like the phantasmagoria ball.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I just don't want to risk it.
Just in case something triggers it, like, a touch or something makes them come out.
-LIAM-
Just shards of hard candy. (ticks)
-ASHLEY-
Beau, do you need a hand?
-MARISHA-
It's been a while since I've asked for this favor, but
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I can--
-MARISHA-
Will you hold me and carry me?
-ASHLEY-
I can hold you.
-MARISHA-
Okay, thank you.
-LAURA-
(cackles)
-ASHLEY-
Take a load off.
-MARISHA-
Okay, this is nice, thank you.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, you got it.
-TRAVIS-
Are you doing the fireman's carry or over the shoulder like a sack of potatoes?
-MATT-
Like a koala?
-MARISHA-
Fireman's, this my arm over her neck.
-ASHLEY-
Arms around her.
-LAURA-
Patting your little butt.
-ASHLEY-
Her legs around me.
There you go.
-TRAVIS-
There's a good burp.
-MATT-
So Viridian's at the front, and then we have Caleb.
Beau is now being held by Yasha.
-LAURA-
I'll follow behind them because I want to draw this in my sketchbook.
-TALIESIN-
I'll be right in the front, actually.
-MATT-
Right in the front, behind Viridian?
-TALIESIN-
Behind Viridian.
-MATT-
All right, and then Fjord and--
-TALIESIN-
High perception, and that way, people can pull me out of the water If I fall in again.
-MATT-
Fjord and Veth, where are you guys at?
-SAM-
Back.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MATT-
All right, you guys have got the rear.
-LAURA-
As I follow behind Beau and Yasha, when Beau looks back at me, I'm going to be like-- (laughter)
(mouthed) I mean, her big muscles!
-MARISHA-
(mouthed) So warm and strong and comfortable!
-MATT-
Roll a perception check, Yasha.
-ASHLEY-
I was just going to say that.
I can feel her arms moving around.
-MATT-
Yeah, gestating.
-TRAVIS-
She's having a seizure.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
15.
-MATT-
15.
Make a sleight of hand check.
-MARISHA-
Okay! (laughter) I don't know-- I don't do this very often.
-TRAVIS-
Fail.
-LIAM-
♪ Fail. ♪
-MARISHA-
I'm using my good-- oh.
24.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-MATT-
Yeah, no idea.
-MARISHA-
I rolled 19.
-MATT-
Poor thing's hurt.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
(whispers) She smells good. (sniffs)
-LAURA-
I lean forward and I'm trying to smell her as we're walking.
(laughter)
-MATT-
With Viridian helping lead the way, there are a few points in time where some of the larger pits seemed to be a point of stopping and moving around.
You watch as she carries her staff out in front and some of the nearby trees and roots shift to create a makeshift bridge temporarily and helps you continue forward.
There is one more length of this to traverse.
I will need everyone to make one more dexterity saving throw to avoid the darkened pits.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast Resistance on myself beforehand because I've been burned before.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TRAVIS-
Did the-- the saves don't-- It's not a save.
-SAM-
Wait, it's a save or a check?
-MATT-
It's saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
It's strength?
-MATT-
Dexterity.
-LAURA-
Uh oh.
-TRAVIS-
14.
-MATT-
14, okay. Jester?
-SAM-
Fjordteen.
-LAURA-
Nine.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
16.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
25.
-ASHLEY-
17.
-TALIESIN-
21!
-MARISHA-
17.
-MATT-
All righty.
All of you manage to come across mostly without issue.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, we got the same number.
-MARISHA-
We did!
-MATT-
Makes sense.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Jester, unfortunately,
-MARISHA-
I'm just dodging branches.
-MATT-
In the process of watching and making hand motions and drawing this experience, you get about three or four steps before you realize there's a heavy sloshing sound (slurps), and you're about knee deep in the water.
I need you to roll a d4, a d6 for me, sorry.
-LAURA-
A d6.
-MATT-
Yes.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
One?
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
That's never good.
-MATT-
Let me see if I can recall where the previous one was.
As you begin to step into the middle of the space here and realize the danger that you're possibly in, you withdraw your legs from it without issue.
-SAM-
So lucky.
-LAURA-
Cool.
-TRAVIS-
A one did that?
-SAM-
Ones are always good.
-MARISHA-
A d6.
-LAURA-
Is that it, is that it?
-LIAM-
It's not a d20, it's a whole different system.
-TRAVIS-
Did you just walk in that thing?
-LAURA-
Yeah, but I'm going to stare at it for a minute.
-MATT-
Okay, you watch as elements of the murky tar-like liquid beneath it has darkened the lower half of your body, (blurbs) and then just sits there, clusters of dying vegetation floating on top.
-TRAVIS-
You have to be careful.
-LAURA-
Hey, man, it didn't even do anything.
Caduceus, why are you always having so much trouble with this stuff? It's easy, just step right back out of it.
(laughter) (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I feel like I tried that.
I don't know why it didn't work.
I mean, I feel like I've tried that.
-LAURA-
It happens again, just remember--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, maybe I didn't.
-LAURA-
Just walk right out.
-TALIESIN-
It's been very distracting here, to be fair.
All right.
-ASHLEY-
If it happens again, I can always pull you out.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I can't.
-SAM-
Oh, Yasha, Yasha.
I think she's asleep.
-ASHLEY-
(shushes) (laughter)
-SAM-
(raspberries and cries)
-ASHLEY-
No, I want the art to look cool if they can draw it.
-TALIESIN-
(shushes) She's dreaming.
-ASHLEY-
Don't draw it that way.
-MATT-
Speaking of dreams, though.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-MATT-
As you guys begin to move on and find that these thick, clustered, dark tar pits begin to slowly drain away.
The swamp, at least, changes and transitions from this dark, cold space, color seems to return to the surrounding vegetation.
The temperature begins to rise to an uncomfortable tropical temperature.
The heavy armor of which many of you wear and the layers of which you brought here based on your Xhorhasian experiences and the colder temperature of what you just passed through, cause you to begin to sweat beneath your armor.
You begin to hear the buzz of insects swarming and keeping a vicinity to the new sweaty individuals that are traversing this.
Going forward for the next 30 minutes or so through this space, the-- the jungle is back to its fully lush and dense sense that it was when you first arrived on the island, but these insects are bugging you.
You begin to feel a pain and slap as it goes.
-LAURA-
Can you talk to them?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, yeah.
Hey, do you all mind for a little bit? I'm sure there's other things to eat and, honestly, we're probably bad for you.
-MATT-
(buzzing)
-TALIESIN-
We're from way far away.
I mean, like--
-MATT-
(clicks) Right there on the forehead.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
All right, apparently, we have to agree to disagree.
-LAURA-
Can't you just suck them into your staff for something?
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to see if I can rattle some of my insects out of the staff to see if they'll come up and maybe help out a little bit.
-SAM-
Vouch for you?
-TALIESIN-
They're carnivorous.
-MATT-
They come out and hang out on the very, very top portion of the staff and clutching onto the wood.
Not a whole lot of interaction between your beetles and these large, mosquito-like insects that seem to be keeping a very, very close distance to your party.
Uncomfortable as it is, after a while of passing through these clouds and trying to slap them as they come, I do need everyone to make a constitution saving throw for me, please.
(groaning)
-LIAM-
Could I Produce Flame in my hand and using that as sort of like a bug spray.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking West Nile.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
For this.
-MATT-
I'll say with that, it'll give you advantage on your saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
Same thing, 14.
Wait, was that dexterity or constitution?
-MATT-
Constitution.
-TRAVIS-
18.
-MATT-
18. Jester?
-LAURA-
Six.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Caleb.
-LIAM-
26.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
16.
-MATT-
Yasha?
-ASHLEY-
26.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
17.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
15?
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
I'm really sweet, you guys.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Okay.
You begin to look up past the various breaks in the jungle canopy, and you can see the mountain is looming larger and larger still as the day gets closer and closer to sunset.
You can see the colors shifting in the sky, and looking up at the mountain, the mist that hangs and suffuses the surrounding jungle gives it this very hazy, this very dream-like quality to it.
You get momentarily lost in the spectacle of the space around you and shake yourself out of it and still can't shake that feeling like you're being watched.
-SAM-
Oh, that's right.
-MATT-
Jester, you're not feeling so well.
-LAURA-
Like, how not well?
-MATT-
Like, you start to sweat profusely.
Your knees are starting to ache a little bit.
Your stomach's started to knot and twist.
-MARISHA-
No.
-MATT-
As Viridian goes, "(sighs) We should be getting there very soon.
We passed the hard elements of it.
You said you need to rest?"
-SAM-
Oh, yes, that's right.
We're going to take a short rest.
-TALIESIN-
Short rest might be a good idea, especially if there is a way that we can get some-- Are the insects, have they let off a bit?
-MATT-
"Insects?" Are you asking Viridian?
-TALIESIN-
No, have the insects let off a bit?
-MATT-
They let off a little bit, but for the most part, you guys are just pushing them off as they come and smacking them as they go.
It's not the worst it's been, but they're still around.
-TRAVIS-
Is Viridian not bothered by the insects?
-MATT-
She doesn't seem to be.
-ASHLEY-
Do you get bit by these a lot?
-MATT-
"They do, but it doesn't seem to bother me much.
I usually, once again, don't traverse quite as physically through this space."
-LIAM-
Are you feeling all right?
-LAURA-
Um.
-LIAM-
You look a little peaked, different shade of blue.
-LAURA-
I feel kind of shitty.
-MARISHA-
Well, how much longer until we rest?
-SAM-
Do you need to go out in the woods and make a poo poo?
-LAURA-
I can't tell for sure. I'm not sure.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that's the worst.
-LAURA-
It might come out top, it might come out bottom.
-MARISHA-
Ooh, I hate that.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, like you feel it in your stomach?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, the twirls.
-LIAM-
Caduceus, is there anything that you can do for her? Tea or--
-TALIESIN-
I mean, I can try a couple things.
-LAURA-
My skin feels achy.
-SAM-
Achy skin?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Well, that's no good.
-TRAVIS-
You know, I could try to--
-LAURA-
I'm going to sit down.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to use five hit points from my Land on Hands, and I'll touch Jester's shoulder and try and cure a disease or neutralize a poison.
-LAURA-
Touch my head. Do I feel hot, Fjord? Is my head--
-TRAVIS-
Does she feel hot?
-MATT-
She does feel quite hot, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, yeah.
-LAURA-
Do I feel shivery?
-TRAVIS-
Take some refuge with the Wild Mother. (blurbs)
-MATT-
Okay, you feel this warm sensation emerge from Fjord's palm, and as it does, it resonates through your forehead and down into the neck where the lymph nodes felt a little swollen, and with that warmth, the discomfort fades.
The disease that had just set within you is purged from the body.
-MARISHA-
Hell yeah.
-LAURA-
Hey! I certainly don't have to poop anymore.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, really?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
That's wonderful.
Does that mean you went?
-LAURA-
I don't know. No!
-TRAVIS-
No poops?
-LAURA-
It just went away.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, well, that's good.
-SAM-
Wow.
-LAURA-
Wow, thanks, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, no problem.
-MATT-
At this point, Viridian has begun to gather elements of the nearby heavy roots and built this small enclosure, if you will, this temporary enclosure of knotted bark and wood.
-MARISHA-
Holy shit, you did that really fast.
-MATT-
"It's my specialty."
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's cool.
-MATT-
"Come, let's take a rest," and she goes over and sits down, takes the staff and sets it in the ground and begins to meditate, the twisted vines that form the right leg temporarily rooting into the ground.
-ASHLEY-
I put Beau down.
You feeling okay?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, no, you're great.
Thank you.
I'm going to meditate, too, and just try and (snores) and take a power nap and recover some hit points.
-MATT-
Okay, are you guys taking a short rest?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, please.
-MATT-
All righty, you get your spells back.
You get your Channel Divinities back.
Any other short rest abilities come back and you can spend any hit dice if you have them.
-TRAVIS-
During the short rest, can I go over to Jester, and as quietly as I can, possibly out of earshot of Viridian, and just say: Jester, I feel like when those mosquitoes were buzzing that maybe they might have transferred some sort of, I don't know, poison or disease, and what the Wild Mother has enabled me to do is neutralize that.
Do you have something similar?
-LAURA-
Like being able to get rid of disease?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I just wondered.
Viridian said she didn't really--
-LAURA-
Feel anything about it?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I mean, I always have been-- mosquitoes are always attracted to me.
-TRAVIS-
Always?
-LAURA-
I've always had that problem.
My mama says it's because I eat so much candy.
-TRAVIS-
That would make sense.
-LAURA-
But I don't know.
I do have stuff that can help with that, but not right now.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, I also have it.
I just--
-LAURA-
I bet Caduceus has something like it though.
He's usually a bit more prepared in the ways of healing than me.
Sometimes I forget to remember that I'm supposed to heal people.
-TRAVIS-
Right, I also don't want to offend her, but it can't hurt to just try and neutralize something that may or may not be there.
I'll ask him.
-LAURA-
Oh, you mean you think she's diseased?
-TRAVIS-
Isn't it strange that everyone-- (whispering) Isn't it strange that everyone here seems to forget where they are and where they came from?
-LAURA-
Well, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Wouldn't it make sense that maybe it's something on the island that's doing it? What if it's just the wildlife or the mosquitoes or, I don't know, what if they're all just needing to be purged of it?
-LAURA-
Wait, so, you can literally just walk up to her and touch her and then maybe she'll be cured?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Should we ask if she wants a massage or something?
-TRAVIS-
That feels a little overt.
I was just thinking maybe like a "uh-oh!" and trip and "oh, you caught me."
-LAURA-
Accidentally grab her boob.
-TRAVIS-
No, shoulder or elbow.
Why boob?
-LAURA-
I don't know.
It's just that's what it seemed like you were doing.
-TRAVIS-
No, that would be-- I was up here.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay.
I mean, that's better, probably.
-TRAVIS-
How tall is Viridian?
-MATT-
I'd say about 5'8".
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it's the shoulder.
-LAURA-
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
Can I ask you a question?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Do you think it's weird that Viridian, who's not a god, can basically do the same things that the Traveler can do? What if the Traveler's just a druid?
-TRAVIS-
Viridian?
-LAURA-
She's shaping the wildlife and that's something that the Traveler can do.
What if she can make herself really big? I mean, she did turn herself into an owl.
-TRAVIS-
Right, but didn't you also say the Traveler's not a god either?
-LAURA-
Well, no, I know.
Right. He's not.
-TRAVIS-
Right. Is that a problem?
-LAURA-
But he's still supposed to be super powerful compared to other people.
He's basically a god, he's just not a god.
You know what I mean?
-TRAVIS-
(sighs) Yes.
I've been a little concerned that maybe the Traveler's trying to become a god, and you might be helping him.
-LAURA-
I don't think he wants to be a god.
I mean, I really don't, based on conversations that we had.
I think he's kind of over it.
-TRAVIS-
You know, can I just toss out there, though, that when he told you he didn't want all that responsibility and he still makes you go forward with the gathering of numerous, numerous people on a volcanic island, they sound kind of like conflicting messages?
-LAURA-
I am the one who chose the volcano, you know.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but he could just cancel the whole thing at any time, and then responsibility gone.
It just feels a little like he's telling you something opposite of what he's making you do.
-LAURA-
Why would he do that?
-TRAVIS-
I don't know.
I just want to make sure that you're keeping your eyes open to any possibility.
I know he's been with you your entire life, so I'm a little hesitant in saying it.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
-LAURA-
Thanks.
I'll keep my eyes open.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LAURA-
But he's really a good guy.
-TRAVIS-
He's shown us nothing to the contrary.
Okay, I'm going to go talk to Caduceus.
-LAURA-
No, wait, I thought you were going to go grab her boob?
-TRAVIS-
I have to breast first! It's the shoulder.
-SAM-
You have to breast first?
-TRAVIS-
No, I--
-LAURA-
You have to breast first.
He said breast.
-TRAVIS-
Just a titty bit of time.
-LAURA-
And Veth, stop listening in on our private conversation.
-SAM-
Oh, sorry, sorry.
-ASHLEY-
Titty bit of time.
-LAURA-
Oh, man, everybody can hear us.
-LIAM-
He needs to express it.
-TRAVIS-
I'll be back.
Can I go and tell Caduceus the same sort of thing and just the concept that maybe we could be able to lift something?
-TALIESIN-
I was just starting to meditate when this-- what?
-TRAVIS-
I'm so sorry.
I know how important this time is to you.
I just wanted to share the same thing I told Jester to you.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I don't know.
This is really complicated and weird.
I'm not sure. Maybe I have something.
I don't know.
I'm confused.
-TRAVIS-
I just wanted to let you know so if I, all of a sudden, reach out and grab a random shoulder or elbow-- nothing else-- that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm not clumsy or anything.
I'm just trying to see if we can...
-TALIESIN-
No, that makes sense.
-LAURA-
Go do it now, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
I'm resting! Stop talking about it! I have to go rest.
I'm going to meditate.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to talk to the Wild Mother. I'm going to see what I can-- I have some questions.
-MATT-
Okay, so you're going to go ahead and Commune?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm going to cast Commune.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
Eight, yes.
-MATT-
So in the middle of this space here as everyone is resting themselves, you can vaguely hear the louder-than-normal snoring of Beauregard recovering in the middle of this strange, half-root wall, and as you close your eyes and connect with the rather intense nature around you, you can feel that warm embrace.
The air, itself, becomes comforting and sweet, as opposed to the sticky, warm air that's been in the breeze that has been guiding you through this portion of the jungle, and you can sense her smile upon you.
-TALIESIN-
I'm feeling watched.
Is Vokodo what's watching me?
-MATT-
You feel a tug at your shoulder, the breeze as it pushes your face towards the direction of the volcano, and you take that as a confirmation, as yes.
-TALIESIN-
Is Vokodo why people on this island forget?
-MATT-
Still looking upon the mountain, you watch as your eyes focus on the mist, focus on the strange, dreamlike quality, and you sense within the mountain there is something that is indeed robbing people of their memories.
So the answer, you imagine, would be yes.
-TALIESIN-
Do I possess magic that can abate this effect?
-MATT-
You feel a small, growing base of strength in the palm of your hand, and you sense the Wild Mother confidently acknowledging that you have the power within your grasp.
Perhaps not at the moment, depending on what spells you have prepared, but you know you have it as a capability.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
(exhales) So...
Yeah, Vokodo's watching us, and something about it is what's happening to these people.
I don't know if it's intentional or unintentional, but it's connected.
And if your power can't undo this, I'm pretty sure mine can, and I'd be curious to see what you're capable of.
-TRAVIS-
Don't think it's much, but I'm certainly open to trying.
Vokodo's not a god, right? We established that. It's something else?
-TALIESIN-
I don't know what it is.
-TRAVIS-
We just saw this floating island chase us in our ship.
There's no chance that this island is something, right?
-TALIESIN-
I mean--
-TRAVIS-
Who reads books? You, you, who fucking knows if an island is a thing?
-LAURA-
An island is a thing.
An island is-- It is.
It's a massive landform.
-TRAVIS-
No, is it a creature?
-LAURA-
It's in the middle of the ocean.
-TRAVIS-
Are we on a creature right now?
-TALIESIN-
Surrounded on all sides?
-MARISHA-
You just woke me up to ask if an island was a thing?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, motherfucker! Listen, did you not see that astral dreadnought? There is some big shit in this world.
Are we on the back of something?
-MARISHA-
I have no context.
I was asleep, what are you--
-LIAM-
The only knowledge of this island--
-LAURA-
Go back to sleep, Beau.
-LIAM-
-- we have is through Jester.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, what do you mean "a thing"?
-LAURA-
I'm going to just fan Beau to give her a little bit of a breeze.
Go back to sleep.
-ASHLEY-
Do we have any water?
-MATT-
Yeah, you brought water along with the journey, and Viridian, actually, is easy enough to create any fresh water if you need it.
-SAM-
Also, Yasha, I think you still have my flask.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Four months later.
-ASHLEY-
You're probably right.
I do.
-SAM-
So feel free.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to wet a little bit of a rag from my cape and dab Beau's wrists and then put it around her neck so she can cool down while she's sleeping.
-TRAVIS-
With vodka?
-MARISHA-
Is that whiskey? Feels nice.
-ASHLEY-
Just some cold-- yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it's good.
-ASHLEY-
What do you mean by thing?
-TRAVIS-
No, I just mean like-- I'd only heard of dragon turtles.
I'd never seen one before, and it was fucking huge and terrifying.
If it's not a god, and we're on this island that's already changed colors and shapes and the wildlife has changed--
-SAM-
Captain Tusktooth, wasn't this island on a map, though?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, but I couldn't tell you if it was properly charted or explored or any of that.
-SAM-
Well, you found it.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but what this is like a--
-LIAM-
What are you asking? If this island is alive?
-TRAVIS-
Yes! Yes, that!
-LIAM-
Have I ever read about a living island in all of my booking?
-MATT-
Roll arcana or history, your choice.
-LIAM-
Arcana, please.
-MARISHA-
Can I do the same?
-MATT-
If you're not still napping, yeah.
-MARISHA-
I'm being pampered on right now.
I'm living my best life.
-MATT-
Sure, if you want to pay attention to this.
Go for it.
-LIAM-
28.
-MATT-
28.
-TRAVIS-
Booze on your wrists.
-MARISHA-
25.
-MATT-
25, yeah.
There have been myths through the ages of landmasses that turned out to be creatures, whether that be like the dragon turtle example of what you met in the sea not too long before, creations by the gods during pre-Calamity times and the time of the Founding.
The very primal elemental titans that once ruled this land themselves had whole groups of creatures that called them homes, depending, like the earth elemental titans themselves had an entire biome that existed within them as a walking mountain.
There've been examples of it through time.
It's not a common thing, necessarily, and you can't-- I would say you're hard pressed to think of any specific examples of modern time of islands being a living thing.
It doesn't sound out of the world-- you've been to so many weird places and learned about so many weird things.
Sure, it's possible.
-LIAM-
I would imagine that the things I have read about were on a smaller scale than this island even though the island is not that big.
It's a big place.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LIAM-
I say to Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Fair enough, makes sense.
-LAURA-
But if it is a living thing, then maybe the volcano's just like a giant zit or something.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, but isn't all land a living thing?
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
You know?
-LIAM-
Well, <i>ja</i>, but--
-MARISHA-
We're, like, all connected, right? Right, Caduceus?
-SAM-
Oh, boy.
What's happening right now?
-LAURA-
I have no idea.
-TRAVIS-
We're short rest.
We're being eccentric.
-SAM-
Philosophical.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
Waxing...big word.
-MATT-
At this point, as you guys are finishing out the end of the short rest and having this conversation, you watch as Viridian's staff suddenly goes to her side, and she stands up very carefully and goes, "Do you hear that?"
-SAM-
No.
-LAURA-
Do we hear anything?
-TALIESIN-
Hear what?
-MATT-
Actually, it would be Caduceus and Beauregard and Caleb.
-MARISHA-
Did we get a rest in?
-MATT-
Yeah, you guys finished your short rest, but at the end of it, as you listen in, and you can hear what sounds like shifting of wood, breaking of branches.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, good.
-SAM-
The island is mad.
-LAURA-
Like distant or close?
-MATT-
Distant and getting closer--
-LIAM-
Everybody quiet down and get down, please.
-MATT-
-- and then you hear another branch snap louder and closer, and you hear things moving, shifting, leaves and boughs crashing into each other, and it's getting louder and louder.
-MARISHA-
I feel like we should move away from it.
-TRAVIS-
Like (thooms) of footsteps, something big or just the trees moving?
-MATT-
At the moment right now, just hearing of trees and foliage moving.
-MARISHA-
Let's go that way.
-TRAVIS-
Hide, hide?
-MARISHA-
Let's run.
-LAURA-
What do you think it is, Viridian?
-TRAVIS-
Or should we take cover?
-SAM-
I'm going to hide.
-MARISHA-
Hide?
-SAM-
I'm going to just hide and throw some bushes over me.
-MATT-
Okay, hiding? Anyone who's hiding, make a stealth check.
-LIAM-
I'm going to pull out a bit of fleece and start to cast Major Image and just create similar fauna to what's around us, but obscuring the party entirely.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MATT-
Okay.
So as you guys are all having this conversation, you watch as the jungle area around you suddenly is filled with immaterial leaves and branches and knotted roots and vines, and you all feel fairly well hidden.
As you all wait and Viridian looks back towards you and gives a nod of like, "Well done," you hear getting louder and louder, and now you hear footfalls (crunching), not incredibly heavy, but heavy enough, and you see a shape now moving maybe about 30 feet ahead, not directly towards you from what you can tell right now, but shifting parallel to the direction you were traveling, and then you can hear heavier footfalls behind it.
(booming) The cracking and breaking sound of heavy trees and branch gets louder and louder like thunder.
You can see the shifting and moving of heavy tree boughs just at the top of the horizon beyond where the break in the canopy would be, and you watch as a tree (crunches) falls over.
Suddenly, you see a blur of gray as you see a massive, 12-foot tall creature with four arms, gray skin, a white, silver matte of a stripe of hair down its back, this open jaw with sharp teeth come rushing through.
Go ahead and make an arcana check, Beauregard and Caleb.
-SAM-
Beauregard.
-TRAVIS-
What the fuck?
-LIAM-
25.
-MATT-
25.
-MARISHA-
23.
-MATT-
Okay, you both, looking at it, you recognize some of the features, elements of the coloration of the skin are vaguely drow, but monstrous and mutated, and you immediately recall you've heard of in some of the darker drow societies there being a blending of drow blood and demonic blood to create something called a draegloth, but they are creatures that almost exclusively live in the Underdark and to see it here makes no sense, and it's rushing--
-MARISHA-
They live in the Underdark?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Almost exclusively.
-MATT-
As you see it-- As soon as that hits you, you watch as it comes rushing forward and you can see there is blood streaking down its face, and the look on its-- the expression on its large, demonic, twisted face is that of desperation, and you hear (heavy footsteps) coming up from behind it as (crash) breaking through the nearby trees, you watch a giant toothed mouth, jaws open, snatch it from the middle of its leap as it gets pulled in the air.
You can see a large, lizard-like entity standing about 20 to 25 feet tall, this massive mouth of foot-long like-dagger teeth as it lifts in the air and chomps into it.
Blood pours out of the side of it as the large draegloth is like (growls).
(crunches) A secondary horrible crunch sound and it's silent.
You now can see standing, this massive lizard creature, similar to the ones being cooked at Vo the night before, but much larger with these smaller, vestigial arms by comparison as it (crunches).
-TRAVIS-
Is it a t-rex?
-SAM-
It's like Land of the Lost.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
It sure is.
-MATT-
Chews (gulps, sniffs).
So, now, everyone, make a stealth--
-TRAVIS-
Means it's based on movement.
-MATT-
Yeah, I know.
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Just make a stealth check in general.
-LAURA-
We don't know that.
-MATT-
Just make a stealth check in general.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no!
-ASHLEY-
Make a stealth check, okay.
-LIAM-
Does the Major Image help with that at all?
-MATT-
You'll find out.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I'm so happy right now.
-LAURA-
I'm so scared to roll.
-TRAVIS-
You guys, there's a t-rex on this fucking thing or an allosaurus.
-LAURA-
No! (laughs)
-LIAM-
No good.
-LAURA-
No, no!
-SAM-
It's a group check, it's a group check.
We'll be fine.
-MATT-
It is a group check.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
We'll be fine, guys.
-LIAM-
♪ You lift me up ♪ (laughter)
-MATT-
So, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-MATT-
15.
(groaning)
That counts as two failures.
-LIAM-
Seven.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
(gasps) That's two failures?
-SAM-
25.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
17.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
-MARISHA-
15.
-LAURA-
Uh-oh.
-LIAM-
But Beauregard.
-ASHLEY-
Wait.
-SAM-
That's one, two, three, four failures.
-MARISHA-
Is that four failures?
-SAM-
And four successes.
-LIAM-
Bring out the t-rex!
-MATT-
You watch as it kind of like-- It's about 40 feet from you at this point and (gurgles) its big leathery tongue is curling across the outside of its teeth.
The thick, dark purple blood that's dripping from the bottom of its jaw from the remnants of where the draegloth's body was torn open and then swallowed.
It starts sniffing (sniffs).
-ASHLEY-
I put my hand on the hilt of my Skingorger just in case.
Getting ready.
-TALIESIN-
I'm...
going to cast Thaumaturgy.
-SAM-
What?
-MATT-
What are you doing?
-TALIESIN-
I'm creating a sound of a group of people 30 feet away just off our axis, out of its sight.
-MATT-
Okay, roll a deception check, if you don't mind.
-TALIESIN-
Deception check?
-MATT-
Yep, just make a standard roll.
-TRAVIS-
Get rid of the flare!
-MATT-
But you can add your wisdom modifier to it.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, thank you.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-TALIESIN-
Never mind.
-MATT-
As the sound of rustling and voices off to the side, the creature immediately (growls) (receding thudding)
-LIAM-
I'm so mad at you, Taliesin.
-LAURA-
It's not that far away.
-MATT-
Begins charging--
-LIAM-
I'm so mad at him.
-MATT-
-- away from it.
-MARISHA-
For what, because you want to fight it so bad?
-SAM-
I want to fight it so bad.
-MATT-
You guys waiting?
-LIAM-
I want to fight a t-rex.
-SAM-
Let's go chase after it.
-TRAVIS-
You want to go to get it?
-ASHLEY-
Hey!
-TRAVIS-
We could mind control it.
-LIAM-
Caleb doesn't want to! I do.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Come on, 80 hit points, we got this.
-MATT-
You can hear it now. It's off to the side.
You can hear it angrily (growls and crunches) another the tree (rumble) slams near off.
You can see some of the dust get kicked up and blown in this direction.
It's searching for whatever the source of the sound is about 40 feet off from where you guys are.
-MARISHA-
Oh god, that's not far.
-SAM-
Should we sneak away?
-MARISHA-
Let's sneak, let's sneak.
-LAURA-
Yeah, we probably should.
-MARISHA-
Let's go, let's go.
-LAURA-
Should we fly? (laughs)
-LIAM-
How about we don't move for a moment? Don't move at all.
-TRAVIS-
(quietly) Yeah, Viridian, have you seen one of these?
-MATT-
(whispering) "I have."
-TRAVIS-
Do we run or freeze?
-MATT-
"Either. I usually run, but I can fly." (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
That doesn't help us.
-SAM-
She keeps bringing that up every two seconds, by the way.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, we get it. You can fly.
-TRAVIS-
Caleb, should we freeze?
-LIAM-
Not today.
-TRAVIS-
We don't move, or we move?
-LIAM-
No, we stay put.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I cannot fly today.
I mean, I can fly, but you cannot fly.
-MATT-
(thumping footsteps)
-MARISHA-
(whispering) I feel like its nose was really strong--
-LAURA-
(shushes)
-SAM-
(normal voice) Caleb, did you see that spell I cast earlier? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I just put my hand over Nott's mouth.
(slow heavy footsteps)
-MATT-
You see it starts rubbing its nose against the trunk of one of the trees, like trying to scratch an itch.
(crunches and growls)
-LAURA-
It's so cute.
-ASHLEY-
I love him.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I was going to try to start that conversation--
-LAURA-
Shut up!
-LIAM-
-- but the group moved on without me.
-SAM-
Well, we could have it right now.
-MATT-
(receding thumping)
(receding thumping) The footsteps get quieter and quieter.
The distraction combined with the illusion, it did not happen to see through, the lack of movement, and you technically failed on the stealth check, but the illusion was enough to offset it--
-TRAVIS-
Oh, smart fucking wizards.
-MATT-
-- and the Thaumaturgy distracted it enough where it didn't zero in.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, let's go.
-LIAM-
Robbed me of a T-Rex battle.
-MATT-
(laughs) It's okay, another day.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, hold him up, hold him up.
-MATT-
It's a shitty little T-Rex that I brought up.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
So cute.
-ASHLEY-
I love him.
-LAURA-
That's a cute T-Rex.
-TRAVIS-
Damn.
-TALIESIN-
Glue some feathers on it.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-MATT-
So you wait for a sufficient amount of time in hopes that it's enough to not gather its attention and that it's found a new destruction or continued with whatever its venture may be.
-LAURA-
We could've ridden it.
We could ride it all the way to volcano.
-SAM-
Oh, man.
Vokodo would have to take heed from us if we were coming in riding on a fucking dinosaur.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Yeah, man.
-MATT-
Pushing forward, Viridian begins to lead the way.
At this point, you're hitting dusk.
The sky itself is a bright orange turning red, and you can barely see now, passed the distance to the eastern side, the purples and blues that begin to usher in the rest of the dark night.
You could hear some semblance of nighttime insects and crickets starting to make their noises, various denizens of the night coming alive.
However, at the same time, you are approaching the base of the mountain.
You guys are now hitting a steady incline, and it's turned from a walk into a hike, and following Viridian, as you begin to follow the switchback trail naturally up the side of the mountain, that same kind of weird, dreamlike haze still sits over this jungle and the mountain before you.
You get closer and closer to it, and by the time night comes, and you watch as Viridian lights the edge of the staff.
Any of you who have light sources, it would be recommended to create one at this moment as it is getting near impossible to see or those who don't need to necessarily.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, summon the sword, light.
-LIAM-
Four globules. (plops)
-MATT-
Then, within a short trek up the side of the mountain, Viridian goes, "There.
That is the entrance," and she points her staff towards.
You can see the pathway levels out and there is a cave opening about 20 feet from end to end and a jagged top that's about 10 feet, sometimes closer to 12 feet at its apex, and it is just pitch black unto the inside of the mountain.
-SAM-
Is it customary to go in at night or do we have to wait till daybreak?
-MATT-
"I believe any time.
I do not think that Vokodo rests."
-LAURA-
He doesn't sleep at all?
-MATT-
"Well, what sleep do you need when you are a god?"
-LAURA-
I don't know, I mean...
dreaming is really fun, you know? He's missing out.
Maybe that's why everything's crazy around here, you know? Maybe his dreams are crossing over into the real world.
-MATT-
She laughs a little bit.
"I think he'll like you."
-SAM-
All right, then we'll go now.
-TALIESIN-
I think that's a good theory.
-MARISHA-
It's kind of a great theory.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm into it.
-MATT-
All right, as you approach the mouth of the cavern entrance, the volcanic smells of the island become more mineral rich.
The lush plants and ferns that have taken residence around this space here are wedged in the earthy cracks of the mountainside are vibrant and a very, very healthy, larger than counterparts you've seen along the Menagerie Coast and other elements of the tropical jungles and the surrounding area.
The winds are a little strong, though, as you get close to it, towards the crest where this entrance is, and you reinforce your footsteps instinctually.
As you reach the foot of this cavern, there is a faint wind coming from the inside.
The air is actually warmer at the opening of this cavern than the surrounding space.
As night has come, the temperature has dropped, but as you get to the front of this cavern, the temperature spikes another 15 degrees or so.
-TRAVIS-
Is it real lush and green still, not rocky or hot or arid?
-MATT-
Well, it is rocky here at the base, but within the cracks of the rocks, you can see there are a lot of other elements of vegetation that have taken root, and it turns rocky the further up the mountain you go, but at this entrance as you enter, it just looks like it just goes into volcanic rock, porous, black, volcanic rock.
-TRAVIS-
Pretty steep where we are right now?
-MATT-
It was a little steep getting up there, but there's a level off platform right where this enters where you guys have even footing now that you've gotten there.
-LAURA-
Hey, Traveler, you here? Artagan, are you here?
-SAM-
This is somebody else's house, Jester.
-LAURA-
What?
-SAM-
This is somebody else's house, maybe--
-LAURA-
I know, but he said he was going to come because he wanted to see.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
-LAURA-
Do you sleep? I'm not talking to you, Vo-kay-do.
I'm talking to the Traveler.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
"Vo-kay-do."
-LAURA-
This is so weird.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Okay, do you guys rest here or do you enter with Viridian?
-SAM-
Let's go in.
-LAURA-
We should go in.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
Hold on one moment.
Come here for a second.
-SAM-
Yes, yes.
-LIAM-
I place my hand on Veth's shoulder and just cast Enlarge and expend transmutative magic to change my stone's capabilities to fire resistance rather than constitution bumping.
-MATT-
You got it, okay.
-LIAM-
You are now twice your height--
-SAM-
I'm enlarged.
-LIAM-
-- for a minute.
-MARISHA-
You're my size.
-SAM-
Whoa, this is so cool.
-TRAVIS-
It's a good look.
-LAURA-
Is Veth taller than me now?
-LIAM-
<i>Ja.</i>
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-LIAM-
For the next--
-SAM-
Arm wrestle.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(growling) Veth and I are going to arm wrestle.
-MATT-
Both of you guys make strength checks for me,
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
And I'll say for your size, add a d4 to it.
-MARISHA-
My strength is garbage.
-LIAM-
Yes, it is.
-MARISHA-
16.
-SAM-
You said add a d4, right?
-MATT-
Correct. Or, you know what? No, you'd have advantage on it I would say.
-LIAM-
One of those ropy fists.
-MATT-
At this size, it is a strength based thing.
-SAM-
18.
(gasping)
-MATT-
Straight up. It's a tense fight, but Veth takes the victory.
-LAURA-
Holy shit.
-TALIESIN-
That's cool.
-MARISHA-
Look, I'm more into endurance training and stamina.
So, you know.
-SAM-
(low voice) I get it, I get it.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Give me a hug, though.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-MARISHA-
Oh, yeah!
-MATT-
Mid-hug, Veth shrinks down to normal size.
-SAM-
Oh, okay, I'm back to --
-LIAM-
She just hangs from Beau's arms.
-TRAVIS-
Beefy, my gosh.
-MATT-
Viridian's standing there, staff leaning against the entrance of the cave, arms crossed, looking over.
"You're a very strange bunch."
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-SAM-
Yeah, we can't fly, but we're okay.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we appreciate you taking such--
-LAURA-
I mean <i>they</i> can't fly, I can.
-LIAM-
Some of us can fly.
-LAURA-
I can fly.
-LIAM-
I mean, not today, but on a different day.
-LAURA-
I can fly today.
I just didn't want to leave everyone behind.
-LIAM-
I turned into an owl just six hours ago you saw.
-MATT-
"I saw that, it was impressive, yeah."
-ASHLEY-
Wait, I can't remember. Can you fly? (laughter)
-MATT-
"I'm beginning to sense that there is a-- I may have misspoken, and I apologize if I had been--"
-ASHLEY-
No, I'm just giving you shit.
-TRAVIS-
We joke with the people that we like, and we want to thank you for taking such excellent care of us. Tap on her shoulder.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I'll cast Land on Hands and dump five hit points to see if I can cure a disease or neutralize poison.
-MATT-
Okay, as you touch the shoulder, there is a small flash of divine energy and she looks back and goes, "Well, I wasn't injured, but thank you.
I appreciate you looking out."
-TRAVIS-
Just a thank you.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Maybe you had to touch her boob?
-TRAVIS-
I'm not touching any boobs.
-SAM-
Just saying.
-LAURA-
How are you feeling? How do you feel now? How do you feel now? You feel okay?
-MATT-
"I feel fine."
-LAURA-
Okay, just checking.
-TRAVIS-
Jester felt so bad after we went through the mosquitoes and the insects--
-SAM-
Where were you from again originally?
-MATT-
"I don't recall."
-LAURA-
How long have you been a druid?
-TRAVIS-
Damn, fucking balls, they forget!
-LAURA-
Are you an arch fey? How long have you been a druid? How long have you known how to shape foliage?
-MATT-
"Since I've been here."
-LIAM-
Do you remember what the place was like that you are from.
Maybe you don't remember names, but do you remember was it a cold place or perhaps a dry climate?
-MATT-
"No."
-LIAM-
Urban? Rustic?
-TALIESIN-
How intense are we to actually solve this particular riddle before we go inside.
-MATT-
"If you're worried about any sort of toxins, as part of my druidic practice, poisons don't seem to take heed in my body."
-TRAVIS-
Oh, shit, right.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's why the bugs don't bother you.
-TRAVIS-
Not that much, I don't think, not yet.
We'll see, I may regret this.
-MATT-
"Regardless, shall we?"
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
All right, the same marching order, or are you switching it up a bit?
-LIAM-
I cannot see the order.
I'm so far away.
-MATT-
We have Viridian in the front with Caduceus, then we have Beau and Yasha, then we have Caleb, Jester, and then Fjord and Veth.
-SAM-
We're going into lava area.
Anyone fire resistant or fire-- you are?
-MATT-
He is now with the stone.
-LIAM-
I am now.
-SAM-
Okay, yeah, maybe you should go up front.
-LAURA-
Yeah, but he's still super weak, though.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I don't know if I'd put you up front.
-LAURA-
I mean, you're super, like, strong--
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you're valuable.
-TALIESIN-
I'd rather the fire resistance be a last--
-MARISHA-
Just stay in the middle.
-LIAM-
(sniffs)
-TALIESIN-
You're not a shield.
-LAURA-
I'm just saying your arms are really, really scrawny.
-LIAM-
You smell like crayons.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, sometimes I do.
-TRAVIS-
Crayons?
-LIAM-
Tickles my nose.
-TRAVIS-
Is that a Zemnian thing, crayons?
-MATT-
So are we good with this order?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, we're good, we're good.
-TALIESIN-
Yes, apologize.
-MATT-
All right. So stepping within the entrance to the interior cavern at the base of Rumblecusp mountain proper, the black, porous rock that surrounds you is rough to the touch for any that are skirting along the sides of it, crumbly but still, at times, sharp and catching the finger in a way that hurts.
The air is dry and definitely warmer once you've stepped fully within the tunnel itself.
Your nostrils sting slightly with a ripe, aromatic mixture of vitriolic scents that seem to be coming with this wind.
It is lightless beyond the sources you have, and you plunge further down the steady decline of the winding tunnel deeper into the mountain.
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-MARISHA-
We're going down.
-MATT-
And that's where we're taking a break.
(grumbling)
-ASHLEY-
I just want to keep playing forever.
-MATT-
I know, well, let's take a break, and we can come back.
There's another part of the story, don't worry.
We'll be back here in a few minutes while we take a break.
We'll see you guys here shortly.
-LIAM-
Yay!
-TRAVIS-

And then they headbutt.
And they headbutt, and they headbutt, and they headbutt again! And they headbutt. (growls) And I've got to admit, I don't remember anything else that happened at all.
(light music) Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.
It's perfect for the home or the office, or your bathroom.
Ooh, look at this, look at the details, ooh.
Darling, I'd recommend buying two, one for you and another for you, let's be honest.
It's so cute, I can't handle it.
(cat meows) This is a lot of stuff, you guys, we have like so many cool things right now.
All this and more, now available in the Critical Role shop.
(cheerful music) We're here talking about rap battles because this next critter hug goes out to the Hollabacknerds and their insane Critical Role rap battle video.
Yes, that sentence is correct, you heard me.
They are a trio of nerds from multiple corners of the world, Kieren Berling, Gemma Mercott, AKA Nerd By Night Cosplay, and Danny Durato.
Everything from the writing, the vocals, the costume, the makeup, the production, the editing, all done by them.
Their most recent video is Yasha versus Beauregard.
Once again, that's right, ya heard me, so here's a little taste.

That was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
It's so good.
That was so good! And not just the fact that they wrote a Critical Role themed rap, but the cosplay was amazing! It's every facet of it is done to such a level of quality that it's extremely humbling and amazing from our standpoint, doing this show, and just another example of how many talented artists are out there doing cool shit.
Go subscribe to the Hollabacknerds on YouTube, because they do some really fun stuff, and Kieren and Danny have another YouTube band called Cat, Hat, Fiddle, and Friends, and you can follow Gemma's cosplay @Nerdbynight on Twitter.
A lot of people I know who are extremely talented at this.
I am not one of 'em.
I trip over my words constantly, which is a shame because words are like my job.
Hey, same.
Right?! I feel ya, right there.
So I'm like, I can't form sentence, see, it's happening right now, which is why...
Who would you want to see next in a rap battle? I would want to see campaign one versus campaign two, like themselves.
Oh shit.
Yeah, right? That's actually pretty cool.
Wouldn't that be pretty cool? Like Keyla vs Beau, like a rap battle? That's what I'd want to see.
That'd be pretty rad.
I'd like to see a throwdown between guest characters.
Oh god.
We're talking like if we want to bring in Keg versus Reani in a full-on throwdown.
That would get really personal, really fast, and it would just be about sleeping with Beau.
Yeah.
You know what, that's exactly what- That's kinda why I'm down here for this.
That's why I want it.
Marisha, you over there? Are you ready? (cheerful music) (Pumat grunting) (Pumat chuckles) Would you look at that? I think it worked.
You were right, Pumat number three.
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.
Pumat number three? Oh boy.
Well, hello there.
I'm Pumat Prime.
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.
I see this as the Twitch Prime realm, I think, and oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we? Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.
(Pumat chuckles) Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm, but this isn't too bad.
You see, if you already have access to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship after that peace treaty the prime minister signed a few years back.
You just have to remember to renew your Twitch Prime subscription at the top of each month, respectfully.
And hey, if you're already a subscriber, you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription using the Gift a Sub button.
That is, assuming the Empire hasn't sent a tax man to your shop here recently. (chuckling) All right, well, off to find that darn elusive prime rib realm.
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets? Good luck. (chuckles) Pumat three? Subscribe.
Re-subscribe.
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.
-MATT-
And welcome back.
So, Mighty Nein.
As you step into the dark interior of the central volcanic mountain of Rumblecrusp, Viridian leads you deeper in, saying-- what?
-SAM-
Saying what?
-LAURA-
What?
-MATT-
I don't know.
-LAURA-
She said what?
-SAM-
What?
-MATT-
Don't make fun of my speech hiccups.
-MARISHA-
Sorry, I just liked "Rumblecrusp."
-MATT-
Rumblecrusp was good.
-TRAVIS-
I heard it too, but I wasn't sure.
-MATT-
Occasionally the brain gets mixed up and my impediment kicks in. My apologies.
-MARISHA-
It sounds delicious.
-ASHLEY-
The Rumblecrusp--
-MARISHA-
I want a Rumblecrusp right now.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
God, I would kill for it.
-SAM-
Oh, blueberry Rumblecrusp.
Every detail's important, Matt.
We want to make sure we're not missing it.
-ASHLEY-
Rumblecrusp crumble.
-MARISHA-
New, from Slayer's Cake.
-MATT-
Just adding some more hit points to the next battle.
-TRAVIS-
No!
-LAURA-
No! (laughter)
-MATT-
Pressing inward, Viridian does say, "These tunnels can be a bit confusing the further in we go, but the waters are safe.
They're breathable, actually.
The fire god is welcoming and keeps the various tunnels and elements of water within his mountain abode welcoming as well."
-MATT-
"Indeed."
-TRAVIS-
As in you can submerge yourself in liquid water and breathe?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-SAM-
No, thanks.
-TALIESIN-
You seem very surprised considering we've done that before.
-TRAVIS-
With magic.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, I think this is magic water.
-LAURA-
Well, I bet this is magic here, too.
-TRAVIS-
Wonderful, lead on.
-MATT-
"I do warn, though, the air grows heavier and toxic as we travel deeper in.
Best to make haste to the water as soon as we can," and she begins to pick up her pace a bit.
-LAURA-
Everybody brought their masks, right?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay, good.
-MATT-
As you continue down the slowly winding decline of this pathway, this tunnel that goes deeper and further beneath the mountain, that acrid taste in your mouth as the various chemical gases that mix with the air and the warm wind that's blowing through this tunnel past you as you go.
You can taste that very chemical, metallic-type flavor, and the air itself does become heavier and heavier as you go.
-LAURA-
I get out my mom's perfume, my lavender oil, and I put a little bit on a piece of cloth and hold it in front of my nose.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Essential oils.
-MARISHA-
It's the same kind of irony, acrid smell that I smelled before earlier in the forest?
-MATT-
Similar in some ways in the fact that there are a lot of...
mineral elements that are not common towards the surface, but it is a different type.
The air is getting heavier and Viridian says at a certain point, "While the toxins don't affect me, perhaps try your best to hold your breath."
-TRAVIS-
(inhales)
-MATT-
Do you all take a deep breath?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I don't take a deep breath, I just hold it.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Okay, you got it.
-LAURA-
I didn't want to take a deep breath because there's already toxins in the air.
-MATT-
True.
-MARISHA-
That's a good point, yeah.
-MATT-
So all of you beginning to push forward.
Those of you who took a breath, you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus your constitution modifier.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
So what is that for you?
-TRAVIS-
For me, that is-- the modifier?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
So five.
-MATT-
Okay, so, five minutes you can hold your breath.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LAURA-
You, because you didn't take a deep breath, you lose the one base.
So, what's your constitution modifier?
Oh.
Three.
-MATT-
Three, so, you can hold your breath for three minutes.
-LIAM-
Total of three.
-MATT-
Three.
-SAM-
Two total.
-MATT-
Two minutes.
-ASHLEY-
Eight minutes.
-LAURA-
Holy--
-TRAVIS-
Fuck, let's go, fam.
-ASHLEY-
What?
-SAM-
She's got a third lung.
-ASHLEY-
My constitution is a plus seven.
-LIAM-
That can come in handy.
-MATT-
Your saving throw is plus seven, but just the modifier.
-ASHLEY-
Fuck.
(laughter)
-MATT-
It's all good.
-ASHLEY-
I'm all cocky about it.
-TRAVIS-
12 minutes.
-LIAM-
She gets down starts doing one-handed push-ups with her mouth closed.
-ASHLEY-
Three.
-MATT-
There you go, three minutes.
-ASHLEY-
That makes more sense.
-MATT-
Plus the one?
-ASHLEY-
Three.
-MATT-
Okay, Caduceus.
-TALIESIN-
Four.
-MATT-
All right, and Beauregard?
-MARISHA-
Four, yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
So, with the breaths that you have held, you continue down this pathway as Viridian is leading.
The floor itself is rocky and jagged, and as you are rushing, you can see the topography itself drop at times, and your boots catch and in some cases, split or cut against the obsidian flakes and edges of the sharpened broken rock.
And pushing as fast as you can, if everyone could go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw for me.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-MARISHA-
Save?
-MATT-
Yes, to move quickly through here, but without tripping or stumbling your way down the decline.
-LAURA-
Using too much of your held air either.
-TRAVIS-
10.
-MATT-
10, got it.
-LAURA-
♪ N-n-n-n-nineteen ♪
-MATT-
Nice.
-LIAM-
I failed, but I will use my ring of evasion to succeed.
-MATT-
You got it.
-SAM-
29.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
20.
-TALIESIN-
11.
-MARISHA-
11, I rolled a two.
-SAM-
Oof.
-MATT-
Okay, Caduceus, Beauregard, and Fjord.
As you guys are all rushing and following Viridian, Fjord, you turn one corner and your knee slams into the edge of a sharpened blade.
It cuts through.
It doesn't do damage as you pulled back just in time.
You feel the impact, and it would have done some damage, but in doing so, the back foot hits a crumpled part of a ledge and you fall back.
(crunches) Hit the ground as you do.
(gasps) The air escapes.
You do lose two minutes of breath.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
-TRAVIS-
I'm down with you normies at three.
-MATT-
All right.
Caduceus, as you see Fjord hit the ground, you slowly climb down the edge and move ahead, and as you do, you hit a small-- it's like a slick patch of condensation on the ground.
You skid for a moment and you catch yourself, and as you sit up, you realize, as you were keeping low and skidding, that this portion of the ceiling is a bit lower than expected and you (bumps) hit your head.
-TALIESIN-
I'm fine, everybody, I'm--
-MATT-
You lose two minutes of breath.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, wow.
-MATT-
Beauregard, you see this happen to Caduceus and instinctually laugh and lose two minutes of breath.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Amazing.
-LIAM-
That's just right.
-TRAVIS-
So, I'm at three--
-ASHLEY-
That was just right.
-TRAVIS-
You're at two, and you're at one?
-MATT-
It is a three minute journey.
So those of you who are at two minutes or lower, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
I'm also going to give myself a little Resistance before I breathe in.
-MATT-
Okay, Resistance of?
-TALIESIN-
Constitution?
-MATT-
Okay, add your--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, just a--
-MARISHA-
Con save?
-MATT-
Con save, so, that is?
-MARISHA-
20 total.
-MATT-
20 total, great.
-TALIESIN-
(sighs) 10.
-MATT-
Got it, and you, Veth?
-SAM-
A 17, I breathe through my clothes.
-MATT-
Okay, you just barely make it.
In trying to breathe in as you need to, the lungs are burning and you find yourself instinctually, to survive, breathing in.
It stings and burns the inside of your throat and your lungs.
The temperature itself is hot enough in this space, but the toxins that now swim in the invisible air around you just burn horribly.
You manage to shrug off the majority of the pain.
You all rolled above a 17?
-LAURA-
Hmm. Mm-mm. He rolled a 10.
-MATT-
No, you rolled a 10, right, yeah.
The two of you manage to inhale and it burns, but you push forward.
Caduceus, it seizes the inside of your chest for a moment, and you find yourself poisoned for the next 24 hours.
-LAURA-
Oh no. I notice Sprinkle's looking a little uncomfortable.
(laughter) I'm going to hold up my lavender cloth to his nose, too.
-MATT-
Roll a very, very tiny constitution saving throw for me, if you don't mind.
-LAURA-
Do I just roll that with a d4?
-MATT-
Roll a d12 or d20,
-TRAVIS-
(like Sprinkle) (panting)
-MATT-
Just a straight roll.
-LIAM-
(like Sprinkle) (gasps)
-LAURA-
17.
-MATT-
But yet, the toughest-- This guy, who's survived and endured so much, this spindly little creature of nature who has been blessed by the Wild Mother, it seems, much like two of your compatriots, is (tiny hacking), but manages to shrug off the toxic effects of the air.
-LIAM-
(like Sprinkle) I am my scars.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(like Sprinkle) Why?
-MATT-
The air is growing more humid as the dryness of it begins to fade.
As you curve around, the moisture in the air grows thicker, and you begin to see a faint, orange glow around the bend.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
As you curve around the tunnel, you begin to see small orange and red plants growing all along the floor and walls and ceiling emitting a faint glow of the same color.
They have a flowered seaweed-type look to them, a rubbery texture, and you can see, now, the interior volcanic rock that encompasses this tunnel is, in itself, glistening with moisture.
The plants, themselves, are well embedded within the various nooks and crannies of the volcanic rock, and you can see, occasionally every few seconds, droplets (plops) of condensation splashing in the path ahead.
-LAURA-
Does the water feel hot if it lands on us?
-MATT-
Do you want to go underneath the water?
-LAURA-
Oh, I just thought the condensation falling was going to fall on us sometimes.
-MATT-
Sure, and it does, and it doesn't burn through you.
It's not acid, but the temperature in here is very, very, uncomfortably hot.
The tunnel slopes to an end, finally, and the floor itself is now being taken with a liquid surface.
A pool of faintly steaming water, roughly 30 feet across, and the ceiling slopes and ends at the other edge of this pool.
Beneath the water, you can see a faint bioluminescent glow of that same orange coming from plants that now suffuse the entirety beneath the water.
Viridian stops at the edge as well and looks down, and turns back to you.
Anyone here trained in nature? Proficient in nature?
-TALIESIN-
You'd think so, but no.
-SAM-
We all know that the dump stat.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Sorry, Kiki.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I know.
Keyleth is crying somewhere and she doesn't know why.
-MATT-
Viridian at this point, though, does go, "Be warned, these and those are torch blooms.
They're Fire Plane-native plants that live off the dense nutrients of the inside of this mountain, volcanic regions and such."
-LAURA-
Cool.
-MATT-
"Avoid touching them, if you can."
-TRAVIS-
Will they be under the water? I can't, I'm not talking.
-LAURA-
Will they be under the water as well?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-LAURA-
Okay!
-MATT-
And you watch as she then begins--
-SAM-
How do you do that?
-MATT-
-- to wade into the water before diving below the surface, and Viridian vanishes from view.
-MARISHA-
Did you ever want to try ventriloquism or something? Fucking-- like, that's insane.
-MATT-
Is anyone following?
-SAM-
Ooh, next campaign.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, yes, yes, we're going, we're going.
-SAM-
Next campaign, you're going to have a dummy.
-MATT-
As you begin to wade into the water, it is very warm.
It's like a hot tub, like.
It's not to the point of discomfort.
It's very hot, and you can see the steam rising off of it as you begin to submerge, but it's not scalding.
As you continue to step inward and watch as the surface eventually comes up over the top, there's that uncomfortable moment where the breath begins to give out.
You look around you, and as your feet begin to step off the floor and you're now floating above, you can see where the blossoms, the torch blooms just completely coat the bottom of this little lake.
-LAURA-
I'm just going to reach out, I'm going to look at Veth, and I'm going to hold her hand.
-SAM-
Thank you, because I'm not going in there otherwise.
-TRAVIS-
I'll watch everyone's expressions.
If anyone panics, I'll cast underwater breathing on everybody.
-SAM-
I'll pull off my Ring of Water Walking, close my eyes and just let her pull me in.
-MATT-
Okay, it is warm, which is a nice comfort compared to all the cold water that you've hated being a part of before, but those of you who are on the cusp of losing their breath, you reach a moment where you have to inhale, and as you do, the water fills your lungs, but it's not as thick as you'd expect.
It's thicker than air, but it's lighter than the sensation of swimming through it, and your body instinctually panics for a moment.
You begin to seize a bit as you feel the body goes through the process of the beginning stages of downing, and then it calms.
As you exhale and inhale and exhale.
-SAM-
I'm freaking out.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
It's a little wild, but the water is breathable.
-TALIESIN-
Can we hear each other down here?
-TRAVIS-
The Abyss.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It is very similar to The Abyss, actually, yeah.
-LIAM-
Little white rat?
-TALIESIN-
In that case, real quick.
Lesser Restoration, just I don't feel good.
-MATT-
Okay, Lesser Restoration.
You remove the poison on yourself.
-SAM-
Oh, that was easy.
-TALIESIN-
Well, it's a spell slot gone.
-MATT-
Yeah. It takes a while for you to calm down, but you do reach a point where you're calmer.
It's still a very odd sensation, but you're all swimming around this larger lake that descends further before coming to an end, and you can see Viridian swimming towards this heavy cluster of torch booms, and looking back in your direction gives a hand motion to follow.
She begins to speak, and it's interesting.
The water carries the vocal vibrations.
It is slower.
So all the voices come across as deeper and a little sludgy, but you can speak amongst this, and as Viridian says, "Once again, avoid the blooms."
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Don't touch the flowers.
-SAM-
(low-pitched Veth scream-sigh)
-MATT-
She turns towards this heavy wall of tangled torch bloom plant mass, and you watch as it begins to pull away at her approach and reveal a continuing tunnel that delves down at a steeper almost 80-degree angle from where you are.
-LAURA-
We have to swim at an 80 degree angle?
-MARISHA-
That's hard.
-LAURA-
Good thing we're all very strong swimmers.
-TALIESIN-
(uneasy noise)
-MATT-
You begin making your way down to follow Viridian.
What is the marching order now? The tunnel itself that she's going into is about 10 feet across and the interior is completely surrounded by torch blooms.
So you can only really go single file and you have to be careful.
-TRAVIS-
I'll go first since my swim speed is my normal speed.
-LAURA-
I'm going to let Nott go in between me and Fjord since he's the strongest swimmer.
-MATT-
All right, so, Nott between you and Fjord.
-SAM-
(frustrated noise)
-LAURA-
I've got your back.
-MATT-
Who's after Jester?
-LAURA-
I'm right here.
-MARISHA-
I'll go after Jester.
-TALIESIN-
And I'll go after Beau.
-MATT-
All right, and then Caleb and Yasha?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'll go second to last.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, I'll go last.
-MATT-
All right, and Yasha's at the caboose. Got it. All right.
-SAM-
I'm just closing my eyes this whole time.
You got to push me.
-LAURA-
Well, it's difficult.
You need to open your eyes.
-SAM-
Mm-mm.
-LAURA-
Veth, open your eyes.
-SAM-
Nope.
-LIAM-
(low-pitched mumbling)
-MATT-
You all begin to make your way through, and you can see the tunnel shifts rapidly and splinters off into different directions.
There's a strange sensation as you hit this portion of the water.
I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-MARISHA-
A wisdom save.
-TRAVIS-
Come on, man.
I got to be rolling better than I have been.
-LIAM-
I also have a question.
-TRAVIS-
Natural 20.
-LIAM-
Viridian described all these passages as confusing as we've been going.
Are they supernaturally confusing? Or has Caleb been able to track their progression?
-MATT-
You've just begun to see the splintering points.
So, so far at the moment, Viridian seems to be swimming with purpose, and has a confidence to the path, and you know that she is the one who interfaces often with Vokodo.
So following her seems to be the best course of action.
From what you've seen so far, it could be confusing for somebody who does not know the pathway.
-LIAM-
But I guess my question is: Does Keen Mind let me remember the exact path we took?
-MATT-
It would, yes.
If you had to backtrack, you'd know that.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Natural 20 for 23.
-MATT-
Nice.
11?
-SAM-
110.
-MARISHA-
Two.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
26.
-MATT-
26.
-SAM-
10.
-MATT-
10.
-ASHLEY-
14.
-MATT-
14.
-TALIESIN-
27.
-MATT-
27.
-MARISHA-
17.
-MATT-
17, okay.
Yasha, Veth, and Jester, as you're following Viridian, there's something thrilling about this location you're in.
The mystery of what's beyond.
There's something almost calling you.
There's a drive, a force.
There's something that's pulling you in the same direction as Viridian, but you can sense something's close, and you have to see it.
You have to get there, and you weirdly know the way, and so as you all are swimming and following Viridian, you watch as Yasha begins to push past, and Jester and Veth.
Suddenly confidence takes you, Veth, and the water is not so scary.
This curiosity, this driving force is much stronger than the fear that has been welling up inside you, and you are all taking the lead behind Viridian.
You guys watch as they push past and begin scrambling to the front of this line.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, well, fine.
-SAM-
Still going in the right direction, though, right?
-MATT-
Still following Viridian, and it's splintering.
Some tunnels are curving off.
Some are smaller, some are larger.
Some are similar size to what you're at, but she seems to be following a very particular journey.
-MARISHA-
Beau just looks at Fjord and shrugs.
-LAURA-
♪ We're going to lose our memories sometime ♪
-MARISHA-
Jeez Louise, all right.
-SAM-
It's all good.
-LAURA-
I can't wait to get to where we're going.
(laughter)
-SAM-
This is fun.
-ASHLEY-
Me too.
-MARISHA-
Is my voice deeper?
-TRAVIS-
That did nothing when you talked. You just did this.
-MARISHA-
(mumbles)
-TRAVIS-
Is my voice deeper?
-TALIESIN-
It just sounds like, well.
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy.
Oh, hello.
-MARISHA-
We're in a pandemic.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Yeah, we're all getting a bit loopy now.
Pushing through this network of tunnels for about 10 minutes or so, the anxiety begins to build in the stomachs of those who watched their friends hurry on ahead, and you fight to keep up.
There is a fervor to the pace of swimming that them and Viridian are taking, and as you struggle to keep up--
-TRAVIS-
Can I try and match the three that are anxious since my swimming speed is the fastest.
-MATT-
You have no problem with this.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, just in case they get too far ahead.
Then, at least, it's Viridian and I plus three.
-LIAM-
And the rest of us are slowed, right?
-TRAVIS-
Half your speed, right, in the water?
-MATT-
Half speed.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
But you push on for about 10 or so odd minutes of adjustment before the pathway suddenly expands into a gargantuan underwater chamber where you can see the rough, black, glassy volcanic rock is broken by heavy patches of torch bloom in corners giving off this pockets of light in this otherwise lightless room.
You can see vents bubbling forth from breaks in the rock and little stalagmites of the same volcanic pillar covered in gathered minerals, and this gas escapes and gathers in the ceiling and then vanishes through small cracks.
You can see heavy stalactites that come down, some only a few feet, some maybe a 40-foot ceiling about you, some of them almost touch the ground.
It is a jagged forest of upside down rock coming from above.
You can see this slight movement as you come in and the water disturbs bit that some of the nearby torch bloom plants sway with the movement of the water.
As you all swim and enter this chamber, you can see some of the rock walls, themselves, glow faintly orange with heat like there is some sort of volcanic proximity.
You've now all entered the chamber, and those of you who were anxious to get here, you've arrived.
-LAURA-
Does it feel like-- do we know we've arrived?
-MATT-
You do, you know you arrived, and then you're like: Why did we-- what are we arriving for?
-TRAVIS-
Cavern space is about how big again?
-MATT-
From edge to edge, from where you're entering now across the way, I'd say it's close to 100 or so feet or more on the opposite side, and from what you can see, you're not able to see the other edge.
You just see one edge of the tunnel and a curving wall around one side, and there are platforms of rock that rise up.
There's a slight, like a bridge over one growth where it looks like elements of the nearby rocks have tumbled in and created a small incline or just built over time from the elements and minerals that are gathering.
You can see on the opposite end just barely out of sight and from a nearby glow, looks like a large pillar of rock that twists up and then stops.
It's really wild interior here, but you're free to swim, if you'd like.
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to thank a bunch of plants.
Thank you for making that clear.
You didn't have to.
I really appreciate it.
We'll be coming back real soon.
We'll see you again.
-MATT-
As you turn and look, Caduceus, you notice that the torch bloom has completely enclosed the tunnel behind you.
It has expanded and swollen and knotted the path that you took.
-TALIESIN-
We'll be coming back out soon, but thank you.
-TRAVIS-
Can I swim forward a little bit and just extend Divine Sense in this watery cavern?
-MATT-
You may, you may indeed.
-TRAVIS-
60 feet; celestial, fiend, or undead.
-MATT-
All righty.
You put the sense out there in this space and...
nothing catches your mind.
Nothing catches your sense.
-LIAM-
Caleb is going to start looking for anything that is not natural, anything that is man-made or humanoid made or of civilization--
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
-- or higher intelligence, yeah.
-LAURA-
Do we still feel anxious, like with a higher purpose of getting here or now that we're here, do we feel like that's calmed down a bit?
-MATT-
Now that you're here, that's washed away.
It's calm.
-TALIESIN-
Do we still feel like we're being watched?
-MATT-
Yes, you do.
In fact, it's more intense than it's ever been.
-LIAM-
25 on perception.
-MATT-
25. You glance around, and the first thing you notice as you enter the chamber and swim out a bit is there are a couple of shiny glints at some parts of the floor.
You glance over, and the one nearest to you, you look over, and it looks like a coin, a gold piece or a silver piece just catching the light, and you see a few more scattered about 10 or so feet from there and a handful that are resting on elements of rock in the middle of this underwater cavern.
-LIAM-
Without touching it, can I focus on one and get closer to it and see if it is indeed a coin or something else?
-MATT-
Yeah, you swim forward and you grab it and it is--
-LIAM-
Without touching.
-MATT-
Oh, without touching, okay.
Looking at it, it's got a little bit of soot on one edge of it, but it does appear to be a Dwendalian gold piece.
-LIAM-
Ah.
-SAM-
Hm.
-TRAVIS-
It's a wishing well.
-ASHLEY-
What's-- yeah.
-SAM-
It's our time down here.
-LIAM-
This is our time.
-SAM-
It's our time.
-ASHLEY-
Viridian, how did you find this place?
-MATT-
"He calls us here, and he is here." And she swims out a little bit into the open space.
"Vokodo.
I come with new... friends." At which point, simultaneously, sourceless but deep in your mind, a presence...
is there.
It's not language.
It's images and shapes and emotions.
It is alien, yet still familiar.
Your brain takes these tangled masses of experiences and processes it as language best that it can, and it speaks to you.
"I have sensed you since you found paradise.
You come to look upon the center of the world and kneel."
-TRAVIS-
"Center of the world and kneel"?
-SAM-
Should we kneel?
-MARISHA-
<i>Can</i> we kneel? We're in water.
-TALIESIN-
I think we're swimming.
-SAM-
Oh, are we in water?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we are still in the water.
-SAM-
We can't kneel.
-TRAVIS-
Are we on the floor or are we in stasis in like hovering buoyantly in the middle of water.
-MATT-
That's up to you guys.
You guys can lower yourself and walk along the floor or swim along the floor if you want.
-TRAVIS-
What is up?
-MATT-
Looking up, you see all the heavy rock stalactites that are coming down at different levels.
-TRAVIS-
Just solid water to the roof?
-MATT-
From what you can tell, yeah.
And your light source is fairly limited at the moment.
It's just little bits of frost bloom--or, sorry, of torch bloom and the spells that you have active.
Make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
I get 20 feet from the sword.
18.
-MATT-
18, okay.
As this voice is happening, and Caleb, at this point, too, as you are hearing this voice, you glance up, and in the center of the ceiling amongst the heavy points of rock that descend, you see a couple other glints, a couple other little momentary shines of light reflecting off other metallic surfaces similar to the one that you noticed.
Viridian speaks out and says, "Vokodo, great fire lord and protector of the realm, these people come to ask a favor." There's a momentary pause before it says, "Ah.
Speak of this favor, new blood."
-SAM-
Maybe we should give some gifts first.
-TRAVIS-
Did he say "new blood"?
-MATT-
Yes.
-SAM-
Some gifts?
-ASHLEY-
New blood.
-TRAVIS-
New blood, new blood.
-LAURA-
Oh, well, okay.
-SAM-
Maybe?
-LAURA-
Do you want some presents before we ask you a favor? Or do you just want--
-MATT-
Before you can finish, "Yes, presents."
-LAURA-
Oh, presents, he wants presents.
-SAM-
So, while swimming, I guess, I'll try to reach down through my pockets and sink a little and come back up, and I have a little, tiny diamond.
It's worth 50 gold.
Blessings to you, Vokodo.
Take this as a symbol of our peace offering, And I just throw it.
-MATT-
You throw it?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay, you chuck it and see it (whooshes).
There is a slight (shushes) shift of movement in the shadow above, and it's gone.
-SAM-
Did that please you?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-SAM-
Okay, okay, okay.
-LAURA-
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
-SAM-
Come on, pony up, everyone.
-MARISHA-
I give him my two gold rings that I have, and I pull them out in my hand, and I just open my hand, and I say, these are for you.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, you're going to make him eat out of your hand?
-MARISHA-
It's a mistake that I have made several times in D&amp;D, but here we go.
-MATT-
Okay, you wait and wait, (laughs) and you hear this low, almost a guttural rasp or a purr is the best way I can describe it.
It's just like (growls), and for a moment, you see images in your mind, briefly, of shines and glittering things, and silver clouts, and in that brief moment, you look back at your hand, and the rings are gone.
You all, actually it would be Caduceus and Caleb, as you watch Beauregard recoil a moment briefly taken with the vision, you see something dark, this long, black tendril just rapidly (shushes) and snatch the rings out of her hand, and then withdraw back into the dark, lightless ceiling of the chamber.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
I'll reach into my coin purse and grab a handful.
Let's call it 10 gold, and I'll throw it up towards the ceiling.
-MATT-
Okay, you throw the coins up, and one by one, they just go out.
-LAURA-
I...
-MATT-
You two and you now can see with each of these coins, these tendrils kind of (whips) and fish each out with fairly incredible speed--
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
-- all emerging from the central ceiling of the chamber.
-TRAVIS-
No, no.
-LAURA-
What?
-MARISHA-
I don't know.
-TRAVIS-
I know.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, I was seeing how much money I had.
-LAURA-
What are you thinking?
-ASHLEY-
What happened?
-TRAVIS-
I mean--
-LAURA-
I am going to pull out my one white sequined glove (laughter) that I've had with me since the very beginning, and I'm going to throw it into the air.
-TRAVIS-
Not the glove, Jester, no.
-LAURA-
It sparkles!
-SAM-
It's so valuable.
-LAURA-
I know.
-SAM-
It's too valuable.
-LAURA-
I've been holding onto it for so long.
-MATT-
The sequined glove travels approximately a foot and a half as it is not a very--
-LAURA-
Flow. (laughs)
-MATT-
Yeah, It doesn't have a lot of heft behind it against the water.
-TRAVIS-
A lot of drag.
-MATT-
Yeah, A lot of drag on that one.
And it just shimmers a bit, and then slowly begins to drift-- (laughter) towards the ground.
-LAURA-
Aw, come on.
-LIAM-
Similar to Beauregard, I also have a gold ring--
-SAM-
It just floats back to Jester.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, shoves it back.
-LIAM-
--that I got somewhere, and I'll just put it on my thumb and flip it through the water.
-MATT-
Okay, (whoops and snips) snatched out of the water once more.
-TALIESIN-
I'll do the 10 gold as well and spread them far out.
See what happens.
-LIAM-
Spread 'em.
-MATT-
As you throw them out a little bit, You see something in the shadow shift to one side, and then (whoosh) a few are fished out.
You see things wrapping around the outside of these stalactites and pulling itself to the other side and snatching the other bits before resting back in the shadow.
You see glimmers of orange, slight glows that spike and brighten for a second and then vanish in the shadow, like the embers at the edge of somebody burning a pipe, brighten and then darken once more.
-LAURA-
Did you not want this glove?
-MATT-
"You've earned a discussion."
-SAM-
Just take it back.
-LAURA-
I'm just going to pick it up.
(laughter)
-SAM-
It's just sad.
-MATT-
"What is your request?"
-LAURA-
Well, we were hoping to have a party on your island.
-SAM-
You're leading, I mean--
-LAURA-
I mean, just what else am I going to do?
-SAM-
Yes, but-- okay.
-TALIESIN-
Just go with it.
It's just got to go.
-LAURA-
This is a really cool island and so we thought maybe we could have a party here and invite a bunch of people.
-LIAM-
A big party.
-LAURA-
I don't know how many will come.
-LIAM-
Fairly medium-sized.
-MATT-
You can see the images flash into your mind, images of ships coming to the beaches of the island and people offloading and the emotions mingle with that, and once again, your brain interprets these images and these thoughts and these feelings as language.
"How many?"
-LAURA-
I wish I had a better answer, you know? It could be 20.
It could be 200.
-SAM-
We hope 200.
-LAURA-
I don't think it'll be that many.
It's all really hard trip, you know? And I don't know.
-MATT-
"And why do they come?"
-LAURA-
Well, I have this friend who...
is...
also a god who thought maybe it would be fun to hang out with you and get to know you and have a party at your house.
-SAM-
Your island is fantastic.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
It's a paradise.
It's sought after across the seas.
-LAURA-
Obviously, center of the world and all that.
People have heard of it far and wide.
-SAM-
Even other gods want to experience it.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
"A god that...
seeks a party?"
-LAURA-
Yeah, well, he's a pretty cool guy, and he likes to party.
-MATT-
"Please elaborate."
-TRAVIS-
Kay, kay.
-LAURA-
Have you heard of the Traveler?
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"No."
-LAURA-
Oh, that's so weird.
I thought all you gods knew each other.
-MATT-
"Bring this Traveler as well.
Bring you all that you like.
You're all welcome here."
-SAM-
Some gifts? Cool.
That feels really good.
Where on the island?
-LIAM-
Are there any spots on the island?
-SAM-
Maybe, limitations?
-LIAM-
Yeah, off limits or--?
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where should we have a par-- where should we do it at?
-MATT-
"Beyond the mountain."
-SAM-
What is she doing?
-MATT-
"The choice is yours.
You wear such shinies."
-MARISHA-
I told you I should've put away my bracers.
-TRAVIS-
If you don't mind, we heard of your splendor as a fire god.
I admit, we are but lowly forms of life.
I'm surprised to see you in this space of water and liquid.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-MARISHA-
Yes, yes, yes.
-ASHLEY-
Good, good, good.
-TRAVIS-
I think I have advantage on these, right? Do I? It's an eight-- no, 17.
18.
-MATT-
It's an 18?
-TRAVIS-
Do I have advantage on deception checks?
-LAURA-
I feel like with your--
-LIAM-
You should.
-SAM-
Some gifts? You have Friends, don't you? You can cast Friends.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's a good idea.
-MATT-
Friends gets a little weird.
-SAM-
Oh, yeah because then they know.
-LAURA-
Because then they know.
-SAM-
Hey, by the way, Marisha?
-MARISHA-
Yeah?
-SAM-
A second ago, you were like this.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-SAM-
I forgot to tell you.
-MARISHA-
What did you get me?
-SAM-
If you ever want to punch Liam.
-MARISHA-
Fuck, yes.
Fuck, yes.
I love you so much.
-SAM-
We just need a code, and you can be like, "Punch Liam!"
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Try it out. Try it out.
-MARISHA-
Well, how about just "Punch Liam" is the code?
-LIAM-
(grunts)
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
Damn it, Marisha.
-MARISHA-
Fuck yes! (kisses)
-MATT-
Okay, so a total of?
-TRAVIS-
18.
-TALIESIN-
I hope it was this funny visually for everyone else as it was for us.
-MATT-
The water around you--
-LIAM-
On the forehead?
-LAURA-
Wait, wait, wait, listen.
-MATT-
Guys.
-MARISHA-
Sorry.
-MATT-
The water around you seems to swirl on its own for a moment, and you feel yourself being drawn towards the center of the chamber a little bit, and as you do, you all watch as the shadows up amongst the stalactites, hundreds of tiny embers begin to flash and brighten, and you watch as tendrils, these big, thick tentacles begin to withdraw from the shadows and lower this massive, black fleshed-creature, where beneath the cracked edges of its blackened flesh, you can see beneath it this underlying, glowing, yellow-orange layer of flame or volcanic material almost.
As it descends slightly, you can see this open jaws with rocky black teeth and the inside of its mouth, this bright, fiery light just emerges and lights up Fjord's face as it descends and gets about 10 feet from you, its mouth open, and you're just there lit by it.
On top of its head, you see four separate orbs, themselves also orange and red with these slight, pointed, red pupils.
You see massive red rocks or gems that are jutting from elements of its body in different places.
These heavy, almost like pseudopod, what would have been tentacles, that have become more like thick legs dangle beneath, and as it hangs, you can see, across its back, a hoard of treasure.
You see chests and coins and objects and just a scattered mass of things of value that have been placed and are now adorning this creature like a shawl or a cape,
-MARISHA-
That's so fucking cool.
-MATT-
And as it dangles there, it says, "Look upon the lord of this island, the Lord of Exandria, and offer.
You have such shinies." You can see the torch blooms in the chamber.
There looks to be another entrance to this that now, all of a sudden, closes up as well.
Viridian is now on the ground and says, "I-I think he wants another offering."
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, that's apparent.
-TRAVIS-
I'd say that's fair.
-LIAM-
What is the distance between this entity and us?
-MATT-
Well, you guys are a bit scattered on the ground at this point.
You and Fjord are probably the ones that were furthest up since you were inspecting.
It's about 30 feet from you.
It's about 10 feet from Fjord as it rushed to him with the water as close to the face, and you're about 10 feet from it.
-TRAVIS-
This didn't trigger celestial, fiend, or undead with Divine Sense?
-MATT-
Nope.
-TRAVIS-
What, what?
-LIAM-
Elemental?
-TRAVIS-
Elemental.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I did not give an offering yet, so.
-SAM-
Yeah, do it.
-ASHLEY-
I don't have a lot of money.
I will go over and, um-- closer to him and I do have 10 gold.
Here is 10 gold.
-MATT-
One of the eyes kind of (crackles) looks down in your direction while the other three are still looking at Fjord glancing over.
One of the tentacles (whips) snatches it out of your palm, and you watch as it places it (crunches) and plucks it amongst the rest of the hoard on its back.
The waters release you, Fjord, and then it stands there waiting and Viridian just goes, "I don't think he's happy with the offerings you've given.
It would do well to--"
-TRAVIS-
Oh, yes.
-MATT-
"-- to give of something sizable based on what you carry."
-MARISHA-
Yeah, well, I asked you about this, Viridian, and you were like, "No, he's cool, he's understanding.
He won't judge you based on your appearance."
-MATT-
"Well, it's not by your appearance.
Usually we just give him everything we have and find."
-MARISHA-
Right, right, yeah.
-LAURA-
Well, but we-- we-- would--
-MARISHA-
He's not getting my bracers.
-SAM-
No, of course.
-MARISHA-
I would fucking murder him before he takes the fucking bracers.
-LAURA-
You know, the thing is we kind of need some of the shiny things that we have to bring you more people with other shiny things.
-TRAVIS-
Well, I do have five of these.
They're all that I have, and I'll take-out five platinum, and I will toss them towards Vokodo.
-MATT-
Okay, you watch as two of the eyes that were facing you look off towards the platinum and you can now see its four massive tentacles with a bunch of smaller ones that occasionally emerge from the body to snatch things nearby and then recoil it in.
-TRAVIS-
Shrimp legs.
-MARISHA-
So cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
It snatches the coins out and brings them back in, but the one eye is still focused on you.
There's the one that's over on Caleb or over now on Yasha, and it just stays there dangling.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm going to slowly start backing off from this thing one foot at a time.
-TRAVIS-
There is more where that came from, but we would have to perhaps take an entry fee from all those coming to the island.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
If that's of interest to you?
-LAURA-
God, we could bring you so much more after everyone gets here.
-LIAM-
Yeah, this is just the down payment.
-MATT-
"You will."
-LAURA-
Yeah, we totally will.
Doesn't that get heavy on your back?
-MATT-
"No."
-LAURA-
It's impressive.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, it's very impressive.
-MATT-
"It is just an extension."
-LAURA-
That's true, though.
Things are not as heavy in the water.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that's fair. That make sense.
-LAURA-
Maybe that's why we're under water now.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You see it looking about the rest of you.
-ASHLEY-
Have you been here just forever? How did you get here?
-MATT-
"Curious questions.
I've been here a very long time."
-MARISHA-
I pull out a pearl necklace that I also have,
-MATT-
(whips) Snatched up.
-MARISHA-
And then I say in Deep Speech: Curious minds want to know.
What are you doing here?
-MATT-
It doesn't seem to flinch or react to the language.
The way that it's communicating to you is a form of telepathy that transcends language.
It's what ever you are envisioning, it's not the words that communicate but the intent behind it.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Which, to that degree, makes it challenging, in some ways, to circumvent social barriers, But you see it kind of-- there's an air of impatience to it as you see the rummaging flames beneath its skin beginning to brighten and flair at moments.
It seems still expectant and Viridian, you see a little fright in her eyes like, "We really want to make sure that our offerings are up to his liking."
-SAM-
We're going to have to cough up something nice here, guys.
-LAURA-
I mean.
-LIAM-
Is there any kind of cover in this room or is it just a large open space?
-MATT-
There's plenty of cover.
There are masses of rock that have either fallen from the ceiling or have risen up from gathering elements and minerals.
You can see that large, twisting pillar-like mass on further in the other side of the room.
You can see there are small outcroppings where some of the chamber itself, becomes a wall in areas, little corners.
-LIAM-
Anything in the middle of the room did you describe?
-MATT-
In the middle of the room, there is one large broken heap of rock with one leaning like a pillar and there's a tunnel that goes through it, and then there is that large, twisted pillar that rises up about 25 or so feet before it levels off.
-LIAM-
Okay, I will move slowly towards the jumbled bit trying to understand if the thing is tracking me as I go.
-MATT-
Okay, are you going stealthily?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Roll a stealth check.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
As he does, I'll go--
-LIAM-
17.
-MATT-
17, okay.
-SAM-
I'll search through the bag of holding, I guess.
I own a 550 gold piece pouch of gold dust.
-MATT-
You do.
Caleb, as you slowly shift in the direction, you begin to make your way towards there, and you watch one of the eyes train on you.
-LIAM-
You are very shiny.
-MATT-
"Indeed."
-LIAM-
I throw 10 platinum into the water above me.
-MATT-
You watch as two tentacles that are holding it to the ceiling, those other two that are dangling below, smaller ones eject and grab the platinum and pull them back in.
You watch as they attach to the body, they slowly move them up like a bunch of cilia or fingers causing the coins to roll up the body until they join the rest of the hoard on its back.
-LAURA-
Does the hoard look like it's only shiny things? Or is it like--?
-MATT-
Make a perception check,
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's what I want to know.
-MATT-
And this will be probably with disadvantage unless you have darkvision.
-LAURA-
I do.
-MATT-
There you go.
-SAM-
I don't like this.
-LAURA-
(singsong) Doesn't matter because I rolled like fucking shit.
-SAM-
♪ Fucking shit ♪
-LAURA-
♪ Nine ♪
-MATT-
Nine, it's hard to make out.
From what you can see, there's a lot of coins.
You see some really fancy dishware.
You can see some weapons, some armor.
It's a smattering of things, but nothing at a glance that catches your eye beyond what you would expect a bunch of precious things to look like.
-TRAVIS-
Jester, you're confident that the Traveler will want to come and meet Vokodo, yes?
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Traveler's definitely going to want to come and say hi.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, then I don't mind handing this over, and I will hold up the Star Razor.
-SAM-
(gasps)
-LAURA-
No, no! Fjord, no.
-MATT-
You watch as all four--
-LAURA-
Fjord!
-TRAVIS-
No, no, it's okay.
Vokodo deserves the shiny.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check for me.
-LIAM-
Do it, come on, face man.
Come on, face man.
-SAM-
Piss off a god.
-TRAVIS-
20, 15 plus five.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-SAM-
All right, all right, all right.
-MATT-
All right, you watch as all four eyes shift towards the blade that you now hold aloft.
Is it lit?
-TRAVIS-
It is, it's glowing.
-MATT-
Yeah, and so as it's right there on the blade--
-LIAM-
It is lit.
-MATT-
Yeah, (laughs) you watch as it descends slightly more, and one of the tendrils, the bigger ones, begins to reach out towards the blade.
"This is a precious offering."
-TRAVIS-
It is.
We expect to be able to go and bring more to you in exchange for this.
-MATT-
Takes the blade, places it amongst the hoard on its back.
"Your offering is accepted." The eyes begin to shift amongst the rest of you expectantly.
You also notice the temperature of the room getting slightly hotter.
The water is rising in temperature along with the expectant frustration that the slightly brightening, simmering fires beneath the skin seem to insinuate.
-TRAVIS-
Do you require more for us to go and bring you?
-MATT-
"<i>Your</i> offering was accepted."
-TRAVIS-
Oh, shit.
-LAURA-
Ugh. I pull out--
-SAM-
Here, take this.
Take the bag of gold.
-LAURA-
No, I have a thing of elven chainmail that I pull out.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
(rattling)
-MATT-
(tentacles whipping) "Your offering is accepted."
-TRAVIS-
We are just paying this dude.
-SAM-
I got this for you!
-MATT-
And you throw the pouch of gold?
-LAURA-
This fucking sucks.
-MATT-
You watch as the pouch gets snatched up, the tentacle pulls it over by one of the eyes and opens it up, and you see, for a moment, this large fiery entity becomes this miserly grandpa rummaging through the pot.
You can see the flame inside the mouth get a little bit brighter and it looks at you expectantly.
-SAM-
Wait, that was a lot of gold.
That was 550 gold.
He doesn't like gold.
-TRAVIS-
I think he wants your--
-SAM-
Well, he can't have it!
-MATT-
The temperature's getting hotter now.
-LIAM-
Caleb has watched all this and is doing math and just stares at the floor for a solid 30 seconds while all that has been going on, and then grips the necklace on him and snaps the cord--
-TRAVIS-
No, no, no! The thing that hides you?
-LIAM-
-- and holds it up--
-LAURA-
(gasps) No, Caleb!
-LIAM-
-- and lets it go and lets it float in the water.
-MATT-
The creature, its eyes spin about, and snatch it up.
Pluck it amongst. One of the eyes looks at you.
"This was precious to you."
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>.
-MATT-
"Your offering is accepted."
-LAURA-
That's not fair. That glove was real precious to me, too.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
One of a kind.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck, oh, man.
-SAM-
Maybe I could have my pouch of gold back if I gave you something? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
That's how it works in Vegas.
Give me the 50 bucks back, I'll give you 100.
-LIAM-
Delete.
-SAM-
We got three accepted offers so far?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
Do we all have to--
-MARISHA-
Do we all have to go?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, I don't want to get sous vide in this cave.
That's how you get cooked by his slow cooking.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I know, I know, I know. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
I pull out my pouch--
-TRAVIS-
Didn't know what it was.
-MARISHA-
-- of very rare and expensive suude.
-LIAM-
Cooking spice? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
This shit is gold depending on where you're from.
-SAM-
The street value?
-MARISHA-
You don't understand how long this shit can fuck you up.
You don't get it.
I've been waiting to murder somebody with this my entire journey.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-MARISHA-
All right, I'm not good at that, okay.
-TRAVIS-
There's always a first.
-MARISHA-
Natural 20.
(cheering)
Look at it! Look at it!
-LIAM-
I can't, you're 47 feet away.
-MARISHA-
I'll take a picture and send it to the group.
Now, wait, wait, sorry, that one got blurry.
I'm texting it.
I'm texting it.
-MATT-
For a total of?
-MARISHA-
Huh?
-TRAVIS-
What's your total?
-MARISHA-
Oh, a 21.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, yeah, you are shitty at that.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Texted it for proof.
-MATT-
You watch as one of the tendrils shoots out in your direction and traces the outside of the bracers on your wrist,
-LAURA-
Ugh.
-LIAM-
Ooh, gross.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And then takes the pouch, shakes it a bit.
-MARISHA-
It's good shit.
It's fucking pure.
All right.
Have fun, man.
-MATT-
It's like the odd kind of, I don't know, cosmic horror version of the hoarder woman in Labyrinth.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I tried to send the most telepathic images I can of him getting super fucked up on it to let him know.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it's a good time.
-LAURA-
I'm really thinking real hard so that it can get to him.
-LIAM-
I gave him a magic item I've had for 100 episodes.
You gave him oregano.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
No, this is the rare shit, dude.
-LIAM-
<i>Good</i> oregano, really good oregano.
-MARISHA-
I have a thing for it.
-LAURA-
Oh, wow.
-MARISHA-
I have a paper for it.
-LIAM-
Ah.
-MARISHA-
It's real,
-LIAM-
Plus one oregano.
-MARISHA-
This isn't Viagra.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-SAM-
All right, all right, all right.
-MATT-
Caduceus, you were saying.
-TALIESIN-
Precious to you or precious to us, precious to me?
-MATT-
"Precious."
-MARISHA-
Wondrous item.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's a wondrous item?
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-LIAM-
Tell him to hit me with the glove.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's right.
-TALIESIN-
I take the shield that my sister made.
-LAURA-
(gasps) No.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-LIAM-
Oh shit.
-TALIESIN-
Off of where it's connected to the one I use.
I take the beetle skins that she made and I hold it.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
(dark electronic music)
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-TRAVIS-
Dark Caduceus.
-TALIESIN-
Where's my persuasion? Seven.
-MATT-
You watch as one of the tendrils scrapes across the surface and then (whips) snaps it with the metal.
The head looks at you (growls).
You can see edges of its mouth become beak-like at the edge.
It's a weird creature.
You're not quite certain what it is, what it was.
It's strange.
-TRAVIS-
What it was?
-SAM-
Yasha, flask me.
-ASHLEY-
Did that suffice?
-SAM-
Gimme.
-MATT-
It's still looking at you expectantly.
-TALIESIN-
I put it back on my pouch.
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-MATT-
It is lowering itself more.
There is an element of a greedy immediacy to its physicality, now, as it slowly begins to descend and it releases the upper portions of the ceiling where the stalactites were, and it's now floating and swimming in the air.
It is a massive form.
It's maybe about 20 feet in diameter from side to side with the tentacles there swirling and swimming in the middle of the water.
-TALIESIN-
I think I got an idea.
Hold on, okay.
Not to me, to you.
I wrest the golden gem that's stuck in my breastplate which is the wound closure.
-MATT-
Mm.
-TALIESIN-
Mm!
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
(whips) "Your offer is accepted."
-SAM-
Give me that flask.
Please? I'll take one little sip and then hand it over.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-SAM-
Oh, I'm great at that.
-LIAM-
I would kill for that flask.
-SAM-
I will take my reliable talent, which will make it a 12.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Oh, god.
-MATT-
It grabs the flask and brings it up, looks it over,
-SAM-
Magical, platinum.
-MATT-
One eye, brings it in front of another, places it amongst the hoard and looks back at you expectantly.
-ALL-
Oh!
-LAURA-
That is just bullshit!
-TRAVIS-
Too much.
-MARISHA-
Too much.
Fuck this guy.
-LAURA-
I hate this guy.
-TRAVIS-
Give him your husband.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
We should just kill him and take all the stuff.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I mean, look at his haul.
-SAM-
That was a fucking--
-ASHLEY-
That was a lot.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I'd sure love to do that with a Traveler on our side.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay,
-LIAM-
It's Jester's dream.
-ASHLEY-
I...
I pull out my Skingorger--
-LIAM-
(gasps) and I chuck it at him.
-SAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
(whips) The blade is immediately captured by one of the tendrils.
-SAM-
That's so heavy metal.
-MATT-
The mouth almost hangs open slightly looking over it with awe and excitement and then adds the blade to the hoard and goes, "Your offer is accepted."
-ASHLEY-
I would like that back one day.
-MATT-
(low chuckle)
-SAM-
We've given you so much.
I gave you a diamond.
I gave you a bag of gold.
I gave you my flask.
-TRAVIS-
Peel your tattoo off.
-MARISHA-
I gave him my good drugs.
-SAM-
I mean I don't have much left.
-TRAVIS-
Pull your tattoo off your face.
-LIAM-
What's the good shit at the top?
-SAM-
(cocking noise)
-LAURA-
No.
-MARISHA-
No!
-SAM-
I got a pistol.
-MARISHA-
Oh, thought it was the crossbow.
-SAM-
It's a gun, they're really hard to find.
-LIAM-
Not like this.
-MARISHA-
Not like this.
-SAM-
It goes boom.
Any interest?
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-SAM-
I am not good at those!
-TRAVIS-
Come on, come on.
-LIAM-
He'll take it regardless.
-MARISHA-
Come on.
-SAM-
I'll take my reliable talent.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh no!
-SAM-
It's a 12.
-ASHLEY-
Come on, come on.
-MATT-
The water around you, Veth--
-SAM-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
-- has elevated to scalding.
(groaning)
-SAM-
Okay, okay, forget that.
That was stupid, that was stupid.
-MATT-
You take four points of fire damage
-SAM-
All right.
-MARISHA-
What?
-MATT-
As you've begun to be boiled in the water around you.
-ASHLEY-
(whispers) Should've kept your flask.
-SAM-
I'm looking.
Give me a second, it's hot.
Is it hot in here for you guys?
-TRAVIS-
It's pretty hot. It's getting hot.
-SAM-
It's begun to get hot.
-TALIESIN-
Humid too.
-ASHLEY-
I feel okay.
-MATT-
"One does not walk into the heart of a god and present paltry gifts."
-TRAVIS-
(quietly) Okay.
-LIAM-
Caleb--
-MATT-
"I accept offerings or I can take what is insufficient."
-TRAVIS-
(exhales)
-LIAM-
Caleb floats over to Veth and turns his back to the thing and palms to her the...
the driftglobe.
-SAM-
What's that?
-LIAM-
I don't use it very much, but it makes sunlight.
It's very rare.
So, it's this big.
It makes daylight in a big space and you just get that shoved into your hands, and then I float back two or three feet.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check for me.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-oh.
-ASHLEY-
Maybe we should just use that in here.
-LAURA-
I know, I feel like that could be useful in here.
-LIAM-
Nine.
-MATT-
Nine, okay.
-MARISHA-
Nine.
-MATT-
You don't feel confident, but also, you're not sure if this creature cares.
-LIAM-
I wasn't trying to Magic Castle this thing.
I was just going take this.
Obviously, with a nine.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-SAM-
I don't-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll cast Mage Hand, and I will use it to lift up my Dagger of Denial.
We'll try that.
-MARISHA-
Which is what we are all in right now.
-MATT-
The dagger is snatched.
"Your offer is accepted." The water cools around you.
It's still uncomfortably hot for all of you, it's on the verge, but it begins to cool slightly.
You're no longer taking damage, Veth.
The images translated into this voice say, "Your initial gifts will tide me over.
Bring to me these travelers, and the next time we meet, I hope to see what you bring me." You watch as the tunnel where you entered, the torch blooms withdraw and leave it open once more, and Viridian goes, "Of course, great Vokodo, thank you.
Thank you." (whispers) "We should go."
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
She goes ahead and swims back as you all (laughs)...
-SAM-
Angry backstroke.
(laughter)
-MATT-
All right, you all begin to making your way into the torch bloom tunnel.
-TRAVIS-
We can follow Viridian or we can follow Caleb, either way.
-SAM-
Or maybe, my Mage Hand is still up.
I could just try to swipe one thing back from it.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe don't.
-SAM-
No, maybe not, okay.
-LAURA-
I say go for it.
-SAM-
Angry backstroke.
-LIAM-
(whispers) We're trying to make a party!
-TALIESIN-
Well, it was nice knowing Veth.
-SAM-
Angry side stroke.
(laughter)
-MATT-
All right, so, are you guys all heading back?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
So Viridian begins to lead you back, and you watch as you're heading in that direction, the torch blooms are separating to enable the exit path.
You guys get a ways away and Viridian looks back over her shoulder swimming.
"That was harrowing.
You were very, how best to say it, unexpectedly stingy."
-TRAVIS-
Well, we told you we didn't want to stay.
I mean, no wonder no one leaves.
He doesn't leave them with anything left.
-MATT-
"Well, there are those who have much to thank Vokodo for his protection and guidance."
-MARISHA-
Like what?
-MATT-
"Material possessions mean so little when it comes to life and happiness and community."
-MARISHA-
What's he do? What community does he bring that you all don't bring yourselves?
-MATT-
"(frustrated sigh)" She keeps swimming goes, "There are many dangers across this island.
There are many things that can sleep beneath it.
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-MATT-
"Vokodo keeps them at bay."
-MARISHA-
Does he?
-LAURA-
Vokodo brings them.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I think that's 100% fucking right.
-ASHLEY-
Also, it's interesting because you were saying that thing was not where it was supposed to be.
So it looks like, you know, the thing with the mouth, the long one?
-LIAM-
Specter.
-ASHLEY-
Specter.
-MATT-
"Indeed. I mean, we've given everything we have to Vokodo, and we mine what we can from the island itself.
I fear maybe we've been--"
-MARISHA-
Duped?
-MATT-
"--unable to provide as much--"
-MARISHA-
Oh, sorry, keep going.
-MATT-
"-- as the fire god needs.
Perhaps he's angry. His--"
-LAURA-
Gods don't need things.
-MATT-
"That's inherently untrue."
-LAURA-
They don't, they don't need things.
Gods don't need anything, they're gods.
-MATT-
"Yet every church, every temple has offerings given day in and day out by followers and priests."
-LAURA-
That's just because those people want to do it.
It's not because gods are coming down and snatching things out of their hands.
It's not like the gods are saying "I'm going to kill you if you don't give me something." It's totally different.
-SAM-
Yeah, I was getting cooked in there.
-LIAM-
Perhaps you could expound on the ways that Vokodo aids you in exchange for these gifts.
How does his aid to you manifest itself?
-MATT-
"This entire island provides us food, shelter, a place to live, a community of people.
There have been terrors that have made their way here, but the angry mountain itself washed them away.
We've heard tales and been given dreams of the horrors that would feast upon us if the fire god was not here with his benevolence to watch over us."
-TALIESIN-
Where are we right now?
-MATT-
You guys are swimming through the tunnel making your way back.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I'm going to wait then.
All right.
-MARISHA-
Oh, yeah, we should call him Guacamole.
That was our codename.
-TRAVIS-
Does Vokodo ever leave this cavern? Does he ever venture outside of the volcano?
-MATT-
"Vokodo does not need to.
Vokodo is the island.
What we saw there was just the heart, the avatar."
-TRAVIS-
Just the heart? Just one piece of Vokodo?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Just his physical.
-TRAVIS-
Are there other hearts around the island, or just the one?
-MATT-
"Just the one, as far as I know, that I've met at least, but these tunnels are part of him, this mountain, those trees."
-LIAM-
It's the long game.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.
-MARISHA-
There's a lot to unpack, yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm not asking this out loud.
Did Vokodo's image, did it spark any kind of-- had we ever seen it anything like that shape before?
-MATT-
Make an arcana check.
-TRAVIS-
Or the book worms?
-MATT-
Yeah, you can make one--
-TALIESIN-
I try to get them out far enough to get a good look at it, by the way.
-MATT-
-- and both of you can make it since you were trained.
-MARISHA-
Arcana?
-MATT-
Arcana.
-LAURA-
15.
-MATT-
15, okay.
-TRAVIS-
I got no fucking clue.
-MARISHA-
Yikes, nine.
-MATT-
Nine. Caleb?
-LIAM-
Yeah?
-MARISHA-
Save us.
-MATT-
Arcana check?
-LIAM-
Arcana check, yeah, sorry.
-MATT-
It's okay.
-LIAM-
Was distracted by other things, 14.
Low roll.
-MATT-
Nothing.
Nothing about its form, its demeanor, its physicality.
The stories around it ring a bell.
It's an odd and strange experience that you've gone through and interfaced with this thing and as you worm your way back towards the exit of this watery passage, you're frustrated.
-TRAVIS-
Hopefully, whatever we bring when the Traveler and all of his followers come is more pleasing to Vokodo this time.
We hate to be a burden upon you or your people.
-MATT-
"Of course, of course.
Well, you say many are coming and if they are bringing tidings with them and these offerings are brought, perhaps that will temper his...
frustration."
-TRAVIS-
Certainly, I suppose it will be up to Jester and the rest of us to figure out what part of the island we should direct them to.
-SAM-
Perhaps we should go search some other areas after a night's rest to see if there's a proper staging ground for?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
He seemed to say anywhere besides the mountain.
Is that what you understood?
-MATT-
"If you're welcome to, but the mountain has its own inherent dangers.
The island entirely has its own."
-TRAVIS-
Clearly.
-TALIESIN-
Ghosts, dinosaurs, stuff.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Caduceus.
-SAM-
That's the episode title right there.
-LIAM-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
Join me for an episode of Ghosts, Dinosaurs, and Stuff.
-MATT-
I think that's exactly what it's going to be, yeah.
I'm going to write that down.
-TRAVIS-
Might have spoilers.
Oh my god.
-MATT-
Perfect.
-SAM-
Wha-- I mean, I guess thank you for bringing us.
-TALIESIN-
Are you going to stay with us as we explore the rest of the island, or--?
-MATT-
"Depends on how much you plan to explore.
This passage here is one that I make rather rapid pilgrimage on to bring the offerings and findings that the village has gathered upon the island and from those who come to visit and eventually stay.
To be too far gone would be to ignore my duties as the spiritual guardian of the village.
Perhaps for a brief time and depending on where you choose to journey, but my heart and my charge is with Vo."
-TALIESIN-
We do what--
-LAURA-
Does Vo ever get-- sorry.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-LAURA-
Does Vo ever get pissed at you? You know, because don't the villagers run out of things to give him?
-MATT-
"Well, then we make them and we mine them and we scrounge and search."
-TALIESIN-
You mine from him?
-LAURA-
Yeah, exactly, he is the island.
So your basically pulling out his own poop to give back to him or something?
-MATT-
You can see behind the eyes, there is an attempt--
-MARISHA-
Some logic?
-MATT-
-- to tie these together and then they squint and, "We do not question.
We just accept and appreciate what is offered."
-MARISHA-
Yeah, but it's your own thing going against your own thing.
-TALIESIN-
How far are we now, by the way?
-MATT-
You guys are now coming towards the edge of the tunnel where it opens up into the pool where you first submerged.
-TALIESIN-
I think I'm going to try that thing once we bed down for the night.
I think we're going to have to bed down tonight.
-LAURA-
Yeah, once we get out of the toxic air.
-MARISHA-
You're going to camp with us, yeah?
-MATT-
"Of course, we should rest for the night, but we should leave the dangerous elements of the cavern.
I would recommend staying probably within the mouth of the entrance."
-LIAM-
Yeah, at the edge.
-MATT-
"Yes."
-SAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
When we went to see him, did we go down or did we just stay even?
-MATT-
You went down.
-LAURA-
So we're underground to see Vokodo?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we went up a mountain into a mouth and then down.
-LAURA-
Has Vokodo ever come out of the mountain?
-TRAVIS-
That's what I asked.
He said he didn't need to because he is the island.
-LAURA-
Obviously, yeah, yeah, obviously.
-SAM-
Viridian, has Vokodo ever come out of the mountain?
-MATT-
"No, no, he has not."
-LAURA-
How many entrances are there into the mountain?
-MATT-
"I know there are probably a few, but this is the one that has been allocated to me.
Vokodo prefers to prevent others from stumbling upon the interior of his heart chamber for fear of--"
-ASHLEY-
Taking him by surprise, or--?
-MATT-
"Or for fear of those arriving without a proper offering."
-LIAM-
What's the most valuable offering you ever gave to Vokodo?
-LAURA-
Please, she doesn't remember.
-LIAM-
Maybe.
-MATT-
She thinks for a moment and goes, "There was once a ship that came, pirates of some kind, and they were carrying a jewel that they had stolen.
That was worth quite a bit.
Beautiful and green, this emerald about the size of a fist, but the pirates never left.
They joined the community and when the gem was given, Vokodo was elated.
For the next spring, we had quite a bountiful harvest of the local jungles and trees.
The fruits were lush, the gifts were endless."
-ASHLEY-
Does--
-SAM-
It was an emerald, sorry, sorry, sorry, no, you go.
-ASHLEY-
No, go ahead because I have a question outside of the--
-SAM-
I just think did you--
-MATT-
At this point, you guys are now reaching the surface of the water, you guys are now reaching the surface of the water, which goes into the very toxic air.
So you may have to take a deep breath of water before traversing and exiting.
-MARISHA-
Let's put a pin in all of this, yeah.
-SAM-
(mumbling)
-LIAM-
Breathe, Ed Harris, breathe.
-SAM-
Was it a smooth gem? Like a smooth gem? Like a round sort of gem?
-LIAM-
A smooth jam?
-MATT-
"It was somewhat faceted.
It was worked.
I'm not very knowledgeable in the way of--"
-SAM-
This big?
-MATT-
"It was about that large."
-LAURA-
This large?
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-LAURA-
Like the Jewel of the Nile, like Romancing the Stone.
-MATT-
"It was like a square-ish shape."
-SAM-
Obviously, it's one of my favorite movies, sure.
-LIAM-
Like Tusk Love?
-TALIESIN-
All right, are we doing this?
-MATT-
You guys all take a deep breath and she shows you take a deep breath of the water, and then all begin to make your way back through the way you came.
I would like dexterity saving throws all around.
Because you know of some of the things that are an issue, the DC is a little bit lower.
So do not worry.
-TRAVIS-
Get the fuck out of here.
-TALIESIN-
Stop it.
-MATT-
What you got, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
Five. My dexterity checks suck.
-MATT-
You are climbing up on over one of the ledges, one of the ones you jumped off previously and wasn't an issue, as you're climbing up, part of the edge obsidian breaks, and as you do, chest slams into the edge, and you pull yourself up, but you lost two minutes of air.
-TRAVIS-
Cool, back down to three.
-LAURA-
22.
-MATT-
Nice.
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-SAM-
15.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
15.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
Nine.
-MARISHA-
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Damn.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
Ska-skow!
-MATT-
So Caduceus, as you're all making your way through, you fall a little bit behind.
-SAM-
♪ Making my way! ♪
-ASHLEY-
♪ Making my way! ♪
-MATT-
You're starting to feel winded a bit.
The heat's gotten to you, the waterlogged elements of it.
You're squinting your eyes a bit as the water and sweat's mingling and burning your eyes a bit, and as you open up once more, you realize you've gone off course a little bit and shoulder checked the edge of one of the curves, and as you do (gasps), you exhale a bit.
You lose two minutes of breath.
-LIAM-
Dang it.
-MATT-
That puts you at?
-TALIESIN-
It's constitution plus one?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Two.
-MATT-
Two, all right, so, as you guys are making, the air begins to clear up a little bit.
I do need one constitution saving throw from you, Caduceus.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
It's always Caduceus right now.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
He's had a rough bout this island, man.
-LAURA-
Yeah. This island ain't treating him right.
-SAM-
This island does not agree with him.
-TALIESIN-
20.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
The toxin, it burns, but nevertheless, it passes without taking too much of a--
-TALIESIN-
I remember this.
-MATT-
-- of a terrible hold of the body.
-TALIESIN-
I remember this.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
You guys eventually make your way towards the interior of where the cavern entrance is.
You can see out now upon the night jungle, or you would be able to, but it's pitch black with elements of occasional bits of light, like little firebugs that occasionally dip through elements of jungle in the distance, but it is just black beyond that.
You can hear the loud sounds of the insects and nocturnal creatures, now, that are beginning to create this beautiful, but also, hauntingly worrying symphony of unknown things that live throughout Rumblecusp, but you set up camp for the night here, I imagine.
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, are we going to do the dome?
-LIAM-
Yeah, we're doming it up to camouflage with the surroundings.
-MATT-
All right.
Viridian asks, "Is there room for--"
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"If you don't mind."
-LAURA-
Cuddle up.
-TALIESIN-
As long as you don't mind, we have a little good night ritual that we do before we go to sleep and when we wake up every morning.
-MARISHA-
For sure.
-LAURA-
We all hold each other's hands, and we sing a song talking about what we're thankful for that day.
-SAM-
Oh my god.
Jester already forgot the nightly ritual.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Make a deception check, Jester.
-SAM-
The new member of the group leads it, though.
-TALIESIN-
No, we'll do it last.
-LAURA-
11.
-MATT-
11. Viridian looks at you oddly.
-LAURA-
You can start singing if you want to.
-TALIESIN-
You're learning, that's good.
You're one of us now. Yeah, this is just--
-MATT-
"I'm all right.
I don't think I need to partake in this ritual."
-TALIESIN-
So we don't have to repeat it, obviously, but we'll go down the line, say our names, talk about our parents.
-LAURA-
Oh, that ritual.
-SAM-
Yeah, see you already forgot it.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no, it's taken her.
And before it gets to her turn, I'm going to cast Greater Restoration.
-MATT-
Okay!
-LIAM-
Oh, shit.
-MARISHA-
Come on.
-MATT-
Make a sleight of hand check for me.
-LIAM-
Shit.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I wasn't being sneaky about it.
I was just doing it.
-MATT-
I know, well, casting a spell like this is less of, like, a touch and it's more of like a incantation and then a place.
So it is still a very visible thing, and to surprise somebody with that, if somebody wants to try and distract, they can probably aid with that, but that would be the extent of it.
-LAURA-
I'll distract her.
-MATT-
Okay, how are you distracting her?
-LAURA-
♪ Today, what I'm thankful for is ♪ ♪ that we got to see ♪ ♪ you do all the really cool stuff with the plants ♪
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-ASHLEY-
Can I assist her?
-MATT-
Well, no, if you're assisting, that gives you advantage, sorry.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay, good. (laughs)
-SAM-
That was horrible.
-TRAVIS-
Were you going to whip out the bone saw?
-SAM-
(squeals)
-TALIESIN-
No, seven.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MATT-
Okay, as you're singing, she looks a little put off by this, and as you begin to reach out for, she rears back and says "What are you doing?"
-TALIESIN-
Part of the ritual.
It'll be fine, and I tap.
-MATT-
Make a dexterity check.
This is now her trying to recoil from you before you can get to her.
You are now reaching out.
She noticed, then she's on the defense.
-SAM-
Spell, dispel.
-TALIESIN-
17, dexterity check? 17.
-MATT-
Check.
17? That wins.
So you reach out and touch her with the final elements of the ritual.
-SAM-
On her shoulder.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
(laughter)
Your turn.
-LIAM-
(like Caduceus) Sorry about that.
-TALIESIN-
Sorry.
-MATT-
As you touch her, her eyes glaze over for a moment, then her eyelids close, and you see the flickering of rapid eye movement from beneath the eyelids.
You see sweat begin to pour from the brow, and her arms begin to dig into the rock around her.
and her arms begin to dig into the rock around her.
You watch as the wind that surround the base of the floor around her begin to whip up a bit, and her hair (blows) drifts as it begins to encircle.
Eventually, her eyes open.
"(panting) Oh no.
I'm so sorry.
This has to stop."
-TALIESIN-
We know.
-TRAVIS-
What has to stop?
-MATT-
"What this thing is doing to all of us."
-LAURA-
What, how long have you been here? What has he done to you?
-MARISHA-
Where are you from?
-TALIESIN-
Easy.
-MARISHA-
Sorry.
-MATT-
"I've been here 25 years.
I'm not Viridian."
-ASHLEY-
What?
-MATT-
"I'm from Tal'Dorei.
My name is Vilya."
-SAM-
Yeah!
-MATT-
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.
(yelling)
-TALIESIN-
Boom! Worth it, worth it!
-MATT-
Okay, so, at the end, she said she's from--
-SAM-
You guys know who that is, right?
-TRAVIS-
-- from Tal'Dorei and she's from where?
-MARISHA-
Vilya?
-ASHLEY-
Azalea is her name?
-MATT-
Vilya.
-ALL-
Vilya.
-LAURA-
Who's Vilya?
-TALIESIN-
Oh my god, the council.
-SAM-
Nope.
-TRAVIS-
What?
No.
-SAM-
Come on.
-MARISHA-
Wait.
-TALIESIN-
What?
-SAM-
Come on.
-MARISHA-
My mom?
-SAM-
Yeah!
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god!
-MARISHA-
My mom?
-TALIESIN-
No fucking way!
-MARISHA-
It's not Keyleth's mom! You cannot do this to me!
-LAURA-
She's a druid! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
[Inaudible] will be fine!
-SAM-
You knew it? He's the one that got it.
I found out 10 minutes ago, and I told Liam.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
How did you find out 10 minutes ago?
-MARISHA-
She's a crazy fucking druid, that's why.
She's a crazy fucking druid.
-TRAVIS-
That just totally disappeared.
-MARISHA-
And got sucked in through the Water Plane! What is happening?! (laughter) What?
-TALIESIN-
Well, you broke Marisha.
I hope you're happy.
-LIAM-
Fucking genius.
-SAM-
Genius level shit, Matthew Mercer, genius.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I'm so glad I did that.
-MATT-
Sitting on that since Campaign 1 began.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
So good.
-TALIESIN-
We are fucked.
-SAM-
So good.
-LAURA-
So wait, wait, in the first campaign, if we'd have come to Rumblecusp.
if we'd have come over this way, we could've found her?
-MATT-
Possibly, but you had no reason to.
-MARISHA-
We would've had to have come this way.
-ASHLEY-
She's been here for 25 years?
-LIAM-
This is the other side of the planet.
-TRAVIS-
It doesn't matter because Keyleth is still totally, essentially the same age.
-MARISHA-
Alive, yeah! Keyleth is definitely still kicking!
-LAURA-
Keyleth could have her mom back!
-MARISHA-
(yells)
-LIAM-
Fucking amazing.
-MARISHA-
I thought my mom was dead! They said my mom was dead.
-TRAVIS-
Everybody thinks you're dead.
-LAURA-
Oh, and Vilya has the leg, the leg.
That's all they ever found was her leg! Why didn't we realize that earlier?!
-TRAVIS-
She's got the fucking vine for a leg!
-SAM-
We didn't know that she had lost a leg.
-LIAM-
Yes, we did.
-SAM-
We did?!
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, because they said that she went into the Water Plane--
-LIAM-
All they found was her leg.
-MARISHA-
She failed her trial.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
So! So is this thing a fucked up kraken? Is that all this thing is?
-TALIESIN-
We don't know.
-TRAVIS-
We have no idea.
-LIAM-
I mean, we don't need to know the specifics yet, it just means that your mom fell into the Bermuda Triangle.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Dude, who the fuck are these other people?
-LIAM-
Fucking genius, fucking genius.
-SAM-
What is so funny and amazing to me, I mean, we are the most suspicious people, and it didn't occur to any of us.
-MARISHA-
No, because it was in another campaign!
-TRAVIS-
When did you figure it out?
-SAM-
Right like 15, 20 minutes ago, I just glanced down to see how many people are watching our show at the end of the night, and in chat, flying by--
-LIAM-
In the past.
-SAM-
-- flying by, somebody goes, "I think that's Keyleth's mom."
-LAURA-
Everybody figured it out?!
-MARISHA-
So it wasn't--
-SAM-
And I was like, what? Oh fuck! (laughter)
-LIAM-
Sam texted me and then I was like, "We got to share this with M," He went, "No!" And I went, "Why, it's Beau!" And I sent it to you like 10 minutes ago, but you never saw it.
-MARISHA-
No, I'm not looking at my phone.
-LAURA-
Oh my god!
-MATT-
I'm so glad you didn't see it out there.
-LIAM-
We can't whisper to each other because we're not next to each other!
-TALIESIN-
I've been holding onto that Greater Restoration the whole goddamn day!
-MATT-
And you know what?
-ASHLEY-
That was amazing.
-LIAM-
Amazing.
-SAM-
So good, Matt, so good.
-MATT-
Well, you guys, that was an awesome session.
I'm excited for the next one.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god!
-TALIESIN-
(cackles)
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
I'm blown away.
-MATT-
Well, on that note--
-SAM-
Wait, we're still playing?
-LIAM-
Yes, we're still on.
-MATT-
We're still on.
-SAM-
We're on?
-MATT-
Yeah, I haven't closed it yet.
-MARISHA-
We're still fucking going.
(laughter)
-MATT-
So on that note--
-MARISHA-
Oh my god!
-SAM-
Now we're done?
-ASHLEY-
I want to keep playing!
-MATT-
We'll see you see guys in the next episode.
-LIAM-
20 more hours.
-MATT-
Thank you for joining us.
-ASHLEY-
Four more hours!
-MATT-
Remember, guys--
-MATT-
I know.
-MARISHA-
What's Korrin going to think?! Ah! Is Korrin still alive?
-LIAM-
We don't know Korrin.
-MARISHA-
(yells)
-LIAM-
You don't know Korrin!
-MARISHA-
No, but Marisha knows Korrin as Keyleth as my past life.
-LIAM-
Who's Marisha?
-TRAVIS-
We don't know Tal'Dorei at all.
-MARISHA-
It all's blurry. Who's on the Tal'Dorei council?
-MATT-
None of you have been there.
-TRAVIS-
We know Allura, that's it.
-MATT-
Anyway, have a wonderful week, guys.
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (laughs) (yelling)

Critical Role Campaign 3 Episode 6 "Growing Bonds and Teasing Threads"
-MATT-
Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
-ALL-
(hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
-MATT-
Indeed. We do have some announcements to get through, so bear with us.
The first is our first sponsor for tonight, NordVPN.
Travis, take it away.
Travis? Travis?
-TRAVIS-
(panting)
-TALIESIN-
You're late for training, Number Two.
Let's review the BBD, TLC, and Run-DMC protocols.
-TRAVIS-
What's the point, Master? I've been training for giga months and still haven't seen any #hact0r 4TC10N.
That spells "action" in leetspeak.
-TALIESIN-
I know what it spells, damn it.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) Hold on, sorry, hold on.
What is this? (laughter) Why does Travis look like a cross between Frank-N-Furter and a BlackBerry Curve? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
His handle is Number Two and I, Morpheus, have been cyber-training him ever since the greatest hacker of the Pepsi generation, blackwillow69@aol.com.
-LAURA-
AKA Sam, the only man I've ever loved.
-TALIESIN-
Was turned into a gleaming cube of cake and the cast used their hacker personas to defeat the Ultra Kodex.
-MATT-
Hi, that was me.
-ROBBIE-
All right, cool, thanks for the recap.
So Travis, he's-- oh, sorry, Number Two, he's got the haxor skills to protect the ultranet from the crypto chaos or something?
-TRAVIS-
Well, I do jack in with the power of NordVPN.
Here, watch me Drop Dead Fred your tablet's BAPS protocol. (grunts) (gibberish noises) Speed zero, speed one, Speed 2: Cruise Control.

Wow, so you hacked my iPad with your hands?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, my virile virus skills don't matter.
Morpheus is wrong.
There is no threat.
I'm control alt deleting out of the program.
-TALIESIN-
Negatory, you're too important, Number Two.
The fate of the world--
-ROBBIE-
Hey, whoa, hold on.
Can I have a hacker name, please?
-TALIESIN-
No!
-MARISHA-
No.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, fine.
Guess I'll just plug in my iPad since you juiced all the battery.
(guttural scream)
-TRAVIS-
Whoa, Robbie, are you okay? Robbie!
-ROBBIE-
(evil laughter) Oopsie, looks like I ganked your new Robbie-- your new friend's body or something.
I'm possessed, don't you get it? I spliced into his mind and now I control his body like a Fortnite no skin.
Observe! (laughter)
Why am I hitting myself? Oh, why am I hitting myself? Your poor friend.
(evil cackle)
-TRAVIS-
Oh man, what a turd.
-TALIESIN-
Who are you?
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, wouldn't you like to know, boomer? I'm your worst nightmare, baby.
I'm a troll that can't be stopped with your pathetic ones and zeroes.
Who am I? Oh, I'll tell you the next time we get sponsored by NordVPN.
Hack to you, Matt.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa, aw yeah, yeah, yeah.
(applause)
-MATT-
Well, uh-- Well fucking done.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, look at the background!
-TALIESIN-
Oh! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Please put that on your reel.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
So good.
-TRAVIS-
Put it on your reel and work never again.
-SAM-
What happened, guys? (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh, hey!
-MATT-
You just missed it, Sam.
-SAM-
I'm late to the show.
-MATT-
You just missed it.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Robbie, you were great.
I have some notes.

I figured.
I figured, yeah.

Oh my gosh, this is the narrated by this guy, with a little help from these guys.
Pick it up at your local bookstore or via CriticalRoleBooks.com.
We got a real book!
-TRAVIS-
It's a real book! (cheering)
-MATT-
Very surreal.
Thank you, Liam.
-LIAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Laura, you got--
-LAURA-
I got stuff to say.
-MATT-
You got a holiday drop here.
-LAURA-
I'm nervous to say it all.
-TRAVIS-
You got this, babe.
-LAURA-
First, this one is like really super-- they're all super super cool, but this one's super super duper cool.
It's our-- Wait, oh, did you already hold it up? It's our limited edition Shaun Gilmore statue from McFarlane Toys.
(oohing)
Ooh.
-ASHLEY-
Look at him!
-LAURA-
He's 12 inches...
tall. He's beautiful.
Anyway, he's also exclusive to our stores and he'll be at all of our stores, so check your store.
If it's not there right now, it might be there soon.
It will be there soon.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-LIAM-
He's a little distracted.
-MATT-
12 inches.
-LAURA-
Next up! Oh, you're holding these up.
-LIAM-
Should we say it or hold it? Hold it and say it.
-LAURA-
We have Whitestone joggers.
(yelling)
-MATT-
Aw, the clock tower on it, that's so cute.
-LAURA-
That's so cool!
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
I love that.
-LAURA-
Look at this beauty.
They're just the same as our other joggers, so super comfy.
-MARISHA-
They're so comfy.
-TRAVIS-
But not for running.
-LAURA-
They're not sweaty yet and this is designed by Grace Berríos.
-MATT-
Yeah!
-LAURA-
Yay! Okay, next up is our Exandria postcard set.
(oohing)
This is really super cool and I've been super excited about this for a while.
This features different locations from around Exandria including-- Oh shit, I should've pulled this out before.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
This is what people want to see right here.
This is--
-LAURA-
Oh, I ripped the box!
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
She's so angry.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, we were talking about these for so long.
-LAURA-
Vasselheim.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I love the art style.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
Emon.
-LIAM-
Oh, those are pretty.
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-LAURA-
Ank'Harel!
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-LAURA-
Rexxentrum!
-LIAM-
Boo.
-LAURA-
Rosohna and--
-TRAVIS-
Save some suspense.
-LAURA-
Aeor, nope.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Aeor!
-LAURA-
You get multiple ones of all of them.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Whoa!
-LAURA-
These were designed by Pretty Useful.
Check them out.
-TRAVIS-
Pretty Useful Co.
-TALIESIN-
Pretty Useful Co.
-MATT-
Pretty sure that was like the Mad Money version--
-LAURA-
@PrettyUsefulCo.
-MATT-
-- of our merch.
-LAURA-
Okay okay okay, next up.
Look, these have been out for a couple of weeks, so if you've already seen them in our store, I'm sorry, but I'm really excited about these things and I've been waiting for these for a while.
It's a little three pack of little teeny books that are sticky notes.
-TRAVIS-
Aw, so cute!
-LAURA-
You guys, these are so cute.
It's a little Chronicles of Exandria.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, it's so cute!
-LAURA-
A little-- look, a little <i>Der Katzenprinz</i>.
That one was designed by Adrián Ibarra Lugo, and this was Grace Berríos and this one is a little Chaos Crew pulp novel.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
Ooh.
-LAURA-
It was designed by Jordyn Torrence.
Look, they've got sticky notes on the inside.
-MARISHA-
Ooh, they're so cute.
-LAURA-
I love them.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Okay, and then the last thing that I'm going to talk-- Our second to last thing I'm going to talk about: We have Koozies.
-MARISHA-
We have Koozies.
-TRAVIS-
We've got Koozies!
-LAURA-
We've got drink holders.
Am I allowed to say-- is Koozie a thing? Is that like a brand?
-SAM-
They're 12 inches.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I don't know.
-LAURA-
We've got drink holders.
-TRAVIS-
In the south, we call them Koozies.
-LAURA-
Look, it's a Nestled Nook Inn.
Wait, flip the other ones around.
-MARISHA-
Oh wait, wait.
-LAURA-
Yeah, they all have Critical Role logo.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit, oh shit.
-LAURA-
The Beaurebar!
-MARISHA-
Beaurebar and (like Grog) Strongjaw.
-TRAVIS-
(as Grog) Yeah. Strongjaw Ale.
-MATT-
Strongjaw Ale.
-LAURA-
Can I have the Nestled Nook Inn? I want to use it tonight.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
And then--
-LIAM-
We call them Koozies in the north as well.
-LAURA-
Do you?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Are they all-- it fits on a can.
By the way, it doesn't fit on a coffee cup from a restaurant.
-TALIESIN-
We just let the temperature have our way with our drinks.
-LAURA-
But they do fit on cans.
Okay, just edit that part out.
-LIAM-
Total chaos.
-TRAVIS-
Get me one of those.
-LAURA-
Yeah, fit it on a can.
It fits on a can.
-SAM-
Who's got cans?
-LAURA-
Show it on a can, Travis.
And then the last thing-- (pleased noises)
-SAM-
Good.
(laughter) 40 minutes later.
-MATT-
Yeah, okay.
-LIAM-
So what is Critical Role, anyway? (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
You can also wear them as mittens.
-MATT-
Worst QVC channel.
-ASHLEY-
Stick your fingers through the bottom if you lose your gloves.
-LAURA-
I'm so bad at this.
Why do they let me keep talking about merch?
-MATT-
I don't know! (laughs)
-LAURA-
Then the last thing we have, I swear, is this and it's so pretty.
It's a Percy shirt.
(cheering)
-MATT-
Whoa, that's actually-- that's fucking awesome.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck yeah.
-LAURA-
Isn't it so cool? It's Percy's first shirt.
-TALIESIN-
Percy's first shirt.
-SAM-
Aw.
-LAURA-
This art is by Olivia Samson, it's so beautiful.
-ASHLEY-
Baby's first shirt.
-TALIESIN-
Look at that.
-MATT-
That's so cool.
-ASHLEY-
That's beautiful.
-SAM-
We're being told on Slack that--
-TALIESIN-
He's so pensive.
-SAM-
Koozie is a trademarked--
-LAURA-
Oh, it is? (laughter) Stop saying Koozie.
-TALIESIN-
Woozies, Woozies.
Floozies, they're Floozies.
I don't know.
-LAURA-
Well, anyway--
-SAM-
We should get some ADR so they can replace it later.
-LAURA-
Drink holder.
Drink holder?
-SAM-
Cozy.
-TALIESIN-
Drink holder.
-LIAM-
Wait, could we also just get some room noise?
-SAM-
Okay, good.
-LIAM-
Okay.
(laughter)
-SAM-
That's all I've got to talk about tonight.
(laughter) (claps)
-LIAM-
Is that all?
-TRAVIS-
What do we call them, drink sleeves?
-MARISHA-
I don't--
-SAM-
Bandaids.
-TRAVIS-
Drink holder.
-LAURA-
Drink holders.
-MARISHA-
Drink holders? But they're, yeah, okay.
-SAM-
We'll fix it, it's fine.
-LAURA-
We'll fix it in post.
-TRAVIS-
They float, they float.
-TALIESIN-
Drink holder.
-LAURA-
Aren't they so cute?
-ASHLEY-
I love them.
-MARISHA-
Drink cuddlers.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay, sorry, I'm done.
-MATT-
Well then, that being the case, let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.
Critical ♪ Thursday ♪ ♪ It's Thursday ♪ ♪ Thursday ♪ ♪ It's Thursday ♪ ♪ It's Thursday night ♪ (flames whooshing)
And welcome back.
So last we left off, the strange crew of wayward adventures had come together, met themselves a group helmed by Sir Bertrand Bell, met themselves a group helmed by Sir Bertrand Bell, then lost Sir Bertrand Bell, went searching for vengeance on the one that took his life.
Through the right questions, the right contacts, located the abode of this strange, dark, seemingly corrupted dwarf and managed to, indeed, find vengeance for him.
and managed to, indeed, find vengeance for him.
Upon returning and giving this information to Lord Ariks Eshteross, he, one, thanked you for doing so, paid you a bounty that he felt was necessary and right, paid you a bounty that he felt was necessary and right, given the circumstances, mentioned that he was still working on a few of the requests that were made of the group, but was making headway and should have updates at some point in the near future.
You were then, where we left off, heading out into the night air of the city of Jrusar heading out into the night air of the city of Jrusar to rest your wounds and whatever else events you wish to utilize to wind down after a very, very long day.
So as you all step out into the night air, the faint mists beginning to slowly rise around the streets the faint mists beginning to slowly rise around the streets and the jungle below, what would you like to do?
-MARISHA-
Spire by Fire?
-ASHLEY-
I'm down.
-TALIESIN-
Works for me.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
Sounds good.
-SAM-
Sounds good to me.
-MATT-
All righty.
You all eventually head to the familiar interior of the Spire by Fire, where the familiar burning hearth on the far end of the now bustling interior and the sounds of laughter and conversation greet you.
You eventually settle within, find yourself a comfortable table that is not taken, and amongst the boisterous, if somewhat solemn atmosphere, and amongst the boisterous, if somewhat solemn atmosphere, given the circumstances that brought you here naught but maybe a day or two before, you get a round of drinks, some food, and the space is yours.
-SAM-
Well, that was an eventful couple of days, huh?
-ASHLEY-
Boy, it sure was.
They sure were, I mean.
(laughter) Lots of days all strung together.
-TALIESIN-
Well, it seems like we're doing this, then.
-LIAM-
What's this?
-TALIESIN-
Whatever this fucking is.
-LIAM-
Oh, this.
-ROBBIE-
What is this?
-TALIESIN-
I got a great idea.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
I'm going to order seven shots.
-MATT-
All right, Ishir gives you the nod and says.
"Yeah, what's he looking for?"
-TALIESIN-
Seven of your whatever's cheapest.
-MATT-
"All righty, I'll go ahead and pour it out for you. (chuckles)"
-TALIESIN-
Actually, just bring the bottle.
This is going to be a thing.
-MATT-
"I like that, bottle charge up." Goes ahead and grabs a handful of small glass receptacles and a somewhat sloshy-looking, dark brown liquid that settles within a faintly green clear bottle that looks like it may have cracked at one point and has been reaffixed with some sort of medical wrapping, but it functions.
Sets it at the table, scatters the glasses out, this wide, lion-like grin, smiling as he looks across the table.
"Well, as long as Ashton's taking care of you, you're all going to have a good night."
-TALIESIN-
So we're going to play a little game that I learned a few years ago.
-MARISHA-
Ooh.
-ASHLEY-
I like games.
-TALIESIN-
It's called, or at least what we call it, is "What the Fuck is Up with That?"
-MARISHA-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Lowest roll has to answer a question truthfully and not too vaguely.
Highest roll gets to ask it.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh!
-TALIESIN-
And then we drink.
-MARISHA-
Are there stipulations to the drinking? Do you drink whether you win or you lose, or do you just drink?
-TALIESIN-
Everybody drinks.
-LAURA-
Everybody drinks every time?
-TALIESIN-
Unless we want to try and slow this down or anything.
-ASHLEY-
Can I have a sip right now?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, we can just fill you up again.
That's fine.
-LIAM-
Prime the pump.
-LAURA-
If we're going to be doing this--
-ASHLEY-
Wet the whistle.
-TALIESIN-
If you like, it can just be who asks and who answers.
-LAURA-
No, no, I'm fine with it.
I would very much like if we were maybe outside.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, is it loud?
-LAURA-
The more I drink, it'll just get harder and harder, so if we could just sit outside that'd be--
-SAM-
Are we in an area that is--
-LAURA-
I just--
-SAM-
You're uncomfortable.
-LAURA-
I feel like you said--
-TALIESIN-
Is there a-- floor that's currently open that we can just take? This is six stories.
-MATT-
You can go ahead and find a private room if you'd like to.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that'd be great.
-SAM-
Like a karaoke room.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Oh wow, thank you, thank you.
-TALIESIN-
Six stories of tavern, there's got to be an empty room.
Okay.
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
Well, the entire establishment is six stories, but there is an elevated floor up top where you can get a little bit distance and the music is quieter.
You find the space up in the second overlooking space, not unlike the backgrounds behind you.
-TALIESIN-
I see what you did.
-MATT-
You find a handful of scattered tables that aren't as lively as the central floor, which feels connected to the energy of the city outside.
So when you come up here, it's a bit empty, a bit cold.
You see a handful of people that are intentionally sticking to the shadows and either in the process of gambling quietly or having clandestine meetings and conversations that just watch as you enter the space and then go back to their quiet, hushed monotone conversations.
But there is a table a little bit away from the chaos here where you can feel a little more comfortable.
-ROBBIE-
Is this better for you?
-LAURA-
This is wonderful.
Thank you.
-MARISHA-
Are those two folks in the corner too much?
-LAURA-
If they get to be, we can scare them off.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
Imogen, is it like a proximity thing?
-LAURA-
Yeah, like if I'm around too many people, it just gets a little uncomfortable, you know.
The farther away I get, the less it's intrusive.
-LIAM-
How far back is good?
-LAURA-
I mean, I really like not being in the city at all.
But if we're here--
-LIAM-
I get that.
-LAURA-
This is a good distance.
-TALIESIN-
This is exactly how the game is played, by the way.
Don't have to use proper nouns for any place or anybody if you don't want to incriminate anybody who is not yourself.
But if it's about you, you got to talk about it.
Are we ready?
-LIAM-
No tapping out.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
No tapping out.
-ASHLEY-
No tapping out?
-LAURA-
Do we drink before we ask the questions?
-TALIESIN-
It depends on how hard the question is.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Wait, wait.
I have one more question.
-SAM-
What if you don't drink?
-LIAM-
That's the question.
-SAM-
Yeah, I'll just fake it.
-ASHLEY-
What happens if you do?
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to take a handful of copper coins.
-SAM-
Thank you, Ashton, that's very kind.
-TALIESIN-
One per round.
-SAM-
All right.
-LAURA-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Would you break down if you did drink?
-SAM-
I don't know, if I drank a lot, maybe, but I think it would just fall down my face.
-LAURA-
Up and out, maybe just seep out--
-ASHLEY-
Maybe just seep out.
-LIAM-
Like Cookie Monster.
-SAM-
Oh, we could try.
Let's try.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
All right, I'm going to do a shot, and see what happens to the liquid.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-MATT-
Okay.
It vanishes inside you.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-LIAM-
(sloshing)
-LAURA-
Can you feel it sloshing?
-SAM-
Can I feel it sloshing?
-MATT-
Do you move around a little bit?
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
Yeah, it sloshes.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I can hear it.
-SAM-
I wonder what's going to happen to it next.
There's no real out.
-LAURA-
Is it dripping? Is it dropping anywhere?
-ROBBIE-
Is there any-- anything noticeable, like sparks or anything bad happening?
-MATT-
Roll a perception check.
-ROBBIE-
Oh fuck.
-LAURA-
Do we need to flip you upside down?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, that's perception?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-ROBBIE-
That's 18.
-MATT-
18.
You give a very rapid, very intense glance, just scanning the exterior of Fresh Cut Grass, and no immediate signs of any sort of errant leakage.
-ROBBIE-
I'm no mechanic, but you look all right.
-ASHLEY-
Do you have a small wonder flap somewhere? (laughter) I'd love to see your insides.
-SAM-
You'd love to see my insides?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-SAM-
I can be opened up for repairs and stuff, but it's a little bit of a difficult process.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, okay.
-SAM-
You need tools and stuff.
-TALIESIN-
That hurt. I aged a year with that.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Same, same.
-LIAM-
Did you all go through the period where you thought that Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins--
-MATT-
Was the little brother in that?
-LIAM-
Convinced, convinced.
-MATT-
Same, same.
Anyway. (laughs)
-LIAM-
"Smile, Wanda!" (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Addendum to the rule also, if you have something you absolutely want to ask, you can challenge somebody, but if you roll lower, you have to answer a question from them or-- and they can take suggestions.
-SAM-
Are we rolling on your standard d7 on this, or what kind of--
-LAURA-
Rollies!
-TALIESIN-
This is just straight Rollies.
-SAM-
Oh, cool.
And we all have dice?
-LAURA-
We all have our Rollies dice, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Here, it's in your shot glass.
I don't know why this is a--
-SAM-
Oh, sure, sure.
-MATT-
It's a big hit in Marquet, Rollies. It's--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, everyone plays Rollies.
-MATT-
Everyone keeps it in their pocket just in case.
It's like Pogs.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Canon.
-MATT-
Yep. (laughs)
-LIAM-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
Are we going?
-TALIESIN-
Yep!
-SAM-
What do we do? We just roll?
-LAURA-
We roll.
-SAM-
We're just Rollies?
-ROBBIE-
Four.
-LAURA-
I think you're going to answer.
-MARISHA-
16.
-SAM-
15.
-LAURA-
10.
-ASHLEY-
Seven.
-LIAM-
Five.
-TALIESIN-
10.
-ROBBIE-
Shit.
-LAURA-
Wait, who's answering? You're asking?
-MARISHA-
I guess I'm asking.
-SAM-
So the highest asks, the lowest answers?
-LAURA-
And we all drink regardless.
-TALIESIN-
Yep, unless you challenge somebody directly.
-ROBBIE-
This is my nightmare!
-MARISHA-
It has to be one person directly?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
Orym--
-SAM-
No, you have to ask him.
-MARISHA-
Oh, oh right.
-SAM-
You're such a rule breaker.
-ROBBIE-
I rolled the lowest.
-MARISHA-
You rolled the lowest.
-LIAM-
New game, new game, new game.
-MARISHA-
Hang on.
There's a lot of rules.
-TALIESIN-
If you want, we can open it up to highest gets to ask.
-LIAM-
Start with the basics.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-SAM-
This is advanced Rollies.
-MATT-
It's one of the alternate rules.
-ROBBIE-
Does she have to say, "What the fuck is up with that?" before she asks the question, is that part of the-- I love rules.
-TALIESIN-
You have to say it at the end.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, okay.
-TALIESIN-
And we can suggest.
-SAM-
Oh, we can suggest questions?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
No!
-SAM-
Oh.
(laughter)
There's much I'd like to know.
-ASHLEY-
"No!"
-MATT-
New rule.
LAURA and TALIESIN: "Don't speak."
-MARISHA-
Your clothes, very fancy.
-ROBBIE-
That is a statement, yes.
-MARISHA-
You keep them very clean.
-ROBBIE-
True.
-MARISHA-
Almost as if you come from wealth.
What the fuck is up with that? (laughter)
-SAM-
I like this game.
-ROBBIE-
I don't know what you mean.
I am but a humble bard.
-MARISHA-
I've never seen a bard in that nice of clothes.
-ROBBIE-
Yes, yes, my family has some money, yes.
-SAM-
Where'd they get it?
-ROBBIE-
Where does anyone get money? Generational, let's call it that, inherited wealth.
-MARISHA-
Are you a lord?
-ROBBIE-
Lord's a broad term.
-MARISHA-
That's not a no.
-SAM-
A noble of some sort?
-LAURA-
Are you a prince?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, no, no, I am certainly not-- (laughter) That's a broad term, prince.
-SAM-
Wait, are you maybe a prince? Are we getting this?
-MARISHA-
Is prince broader than lord? Is prince a subcategory of lord?
-ROBBIE-
It's less official than that.
Let's say I'm second in line to a very prominent family with a lot of money that you have probably never heard of.
-LAURA-
Doesn't he have to answer more than that?
-TALIESIN-
No, I mean, unless there's an addendum waiting or if there's a specific title, but it doesn't actually have to use proper nouns.
-LAURA-
We can ask for clarification--
-TALIESIN-
Clarification, but no proper nouns.
-ROBBIE-
How long does one round of What the Fuck is Up with That last?
-TALIESIN-
Until we're satisfied.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-SAM-
Well, wait a second, I have a slightly different tack here.
Why are you uncomfortable to talk about your family like this? It seems like you'd be proud to come from a fabled noble tradition.
-ROBBIE-
Hm, I'm proud of my family.
My family is full of good people.
But sometimes it's not enough.
-SAM-
What do you mean?
-ROBBIE-
It's good to be good, it's fine to be good.
It's fine to do all the things that are expected of you, but my life is my life and I would rather be here with you, drinking this diarrhea water-looking booze than to be with my family, even though they are good, nice, wealthy people.
-SAM-
So if I may, expectations were put on you and you're sort of going your own path to forge a personal identity apart from them?
-ROBBIE-
It sounds cliché when you put it that way.
-SAM-
No, no, no, I'm just--
-ROBBIE-
No, not exactly, more like expectations I put on myself that I would never be able to fulfill within my family, so I found it easier to be on my own and have been for a while, until I realized on your own isn't quite as fun as I thought it would be.
It's better with friends.
-LIAM-
That answer was Rollies free.
-TALIESIN-
I feel pretty satisfied with that.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Rollies.
-MARISHA-
Cheers.
-TALIESIN-
You don't have to go twice.
-ASHLEY-
Prince Dorian.
-ROBBIE-
I've already had two, thank you, water, please.
-SAM-
Prince Dorian, wow.
-ASHLEY-
It has a nice ring to it.
-LAURA-
I've never known a prince before.
-MARISHA-
Prince Dorian.
-LAURA-
That's cocked.
-SAM-
Prince Dorian.
-LIAM-
What was that term?
-LAURA-
Cocked.
-LIAM-
What's that mean?
-LAURA-
It means that your Rolly was a little janky and so you have to roll it again because you can't tell what number it was actually on.
-LIAM-
Why do you use the word cocked for that?
-LAURA-
Why wouldn't you?
-SAM-
I got a 17.
-LIAM-
Well--
-TALIESIN-
I got a 12.
-ASHLEY-
I got an 18.
-LIAM-
17.
-MARISHA-
13.
-LAURA-
13.
-ROBBIE-
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
SAM and TALIESIN: You're absolved.
Thank you, thank you.
They can't have double Rollies.
-TALIESIN-
I'm 12.
Is anyone lower?
-MARISHA-
No.
-LAURA-
All right.
-SAM-
And we got two 17s.
-LIAM-
And an 18.
-SAM-
Oh, an 18. Oh, why excuse me.
-LAURA-
Ooh, Fearne.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so I'm asking the questions to you?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, ooh.
-LIAM-
Very shy over here, this one.
-ASHLEY-
What to ask you.
-SAM-
Whatever you ask, he/they will say "fuck" in their answer.
-TALIESIN-
That's fucking true.
-ROBBIE-
It's the name of the game.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, this is just a very simple question.
Have you ever been in love before?
-TALIESIN-
You have to end it with--
-ASHLEY-
What the--
-TALIESIN-
Fuck is up with that.
-ASHLEY-
What the fuck is up with that?
-TALIESIN-
That is so good.
Have I ever been in love before? Huh, you know, I don't know.
-ASHLEY-
Fair.
-SAM-
Not fair!
-LAURA-
That's probably a no.
-ASHLEY-
It's very hard to know sometimes I think.
-LAURA-
If you don't know, then you probably haven't been, right?
-TALIESIN-
I thought I was in love before, but I don't know if I ever actually was.
-ASHLEY-
Would you care to elaborate?
-TALIESIN-
Sometimes it is very easy to misconstrue friendship for love, lust for love, it's very amorphous.
I have a hard time defining it to begin with, and there's only really a couple situations where it might've even applied.
-ASHLEY-
That makes a lot of sense to me.
-SAM-
Do you still think about this person or persons?
-TALIESIN-
Not really. On occasion, but not really.
-MARISHA-
How long ago was this?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, 10 years, give or take.
-MARISHA-
You know, I don't think I've ever been in love either.
I mean, that's not true, I deeply love Imogen.
-TALIESIN-
It's a very broad word, isn't it?
-MARISHA-
It is.
-TALIESIN-
It's always bothered me.
-ASHLEY-
Should we think of a new word?
-ROBBIE-
For love?
-ASHLEY-
For love.
-TALIESIN-
For every different--
-LAURA-
Type of love.
-ASHLEY-
There's a lot, that's just-- It's like an umbrella word.
-TALIESIN-
It is an umbrella word.
-ROBBIE-
You meant romantic love, though, in your question.
-ASHLEY-
I think so, I think so, but now you've sort of broadened my thoughts on it.
-TALIESIN-
I've had a group of friends before.
That's what I'll say.
-ROBBIE-
Did you love them?
-TALIESIN-
In the way one loves a group of friends, sure.
-SAM-
What were they called again?
-ASHLEY-
That counts.
-TALIESIN-
Nobodies.
-LAURA-
The Nobodies.
-SAM-
The Nobodies.
-LAURA-
That's a good name.
-TALIESIN-
It was a good crew.
-LIAM-
How'd they come by it?
-LAURA-
We need to think of a name for our crew.
-SAM-
We do.
-TALIESIN-
How did they come by it?
-LIAM-
Sorry, I didn't roll for that.
-TALIESIN-
No, it's okay, I'll keep going.
We all grew up together.
We all kind of had a shit time, and it was a nickname that stuck, and we thought it was kind of fucking funny.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
And what happened to the Nobodies?
-TALIESIN-
They left town.
-SAM-
Except you?
-TALIESIN-
Except me.
-ASHLEY-
How come?
-SAM-
Why?
-TALIESIN-
That's another question.
-LAURA-
Ooh.
-MARISHA-
Shall we?
-SAM-
Rollies!
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-ASHLEY-
Oh dear.
-TALIESIN-
Fuckballs.
-SAM-
19 over here.
-LIAM-
Oh, that's cocked.
-TALIESIN-
Hey, look at that.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's a good--
-LIAM-
Respectable.
-MARISHA-
18.
-SAM-
19.
-ASHLEY-
Two.
-ROBBIE-
Four.
-TALIESIN-
One.
-LAURA-
Four.
(gasps)
-ROBBIE-
Four?
-TALIESIN-
But I already went, so it's up to--
-ASHLEY-
(gasps) Oh, to me?
-LAURA-
Ooh, so you get to ask her?
-SAM-
I guess so.
-TALIESIN-
I like this game so much.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
Boy, I don't know much about you, Fearne.
-LIAM-
One way to find out.
-SAM-
Yeah, I know, but where to start?
-TALIESIN-
I always assume you have questions about everybody.
-SAM-
I do, but it's so many.
-ASHLEY-
I just don't know.
-SAM-
It's hard to narrow it down to one.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
I mean, if we're doing this, s-s-some people have a great regret in their life.
What the fuck is up with that? What's yours?
-ASHLEY-
Oh wow.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I don't think I've ever gotten you to say "fuck" before, that's great.
-SAM-
Well.
-MARISHA-
It's the rules.
-ASHLEY-
Do I have a regret? Hmm.
Boy, that's a good question.
I do have some regrets, and I guess, some of them I don't know how comfortable I feel like talking about yet.
Oh!
-SAM-
Stumped you, I stumped you.
-ASHLEY-
I guess-- I'm having a hard time answering this question.
-SAM-
Well, I can change it up, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
-ASHLEY-
Give me another one.
No? Give me another one.
-SAM-
How about this.
-ASHLEY-
Does that count?
-TALIESIN-
Have to take another shot, but we'll talk about it.
-ASHLEY-
I'll drink more.
(laughter)
-SAM-
I don't mean to pry, but this has also been bugging me.
What did y'all come to town to do?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, what the fuck is up with that?
-SAM-
What the fuck is up with that?
-ASHLEY-
Well, a lot of that is not my story, but we came here to visit this beautiful place and to meet up with some friends of Orym, and to check out how great this town is.
-SAM-
Boy, oh boy.
What the fuck is up with <i>that</i>? (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I guess I'm not very good at answering questions.
-SAM-
I'll try a third one, maybe--
-ASHLEY-
Oh no!
-SAM-
We'll go easier.
How about easier? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Drink again, I'll allow it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I love her so much.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Refused, lied.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
True fey spirit.
-SAM-
How about this, how about this.
How does it feel when you steal something?
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, okay.
-SAM-
What the fuck's up with that?
-MARISHA-
That one excites her.
-ASHLEY-
Well, it's not necessarily a thing of the taking it that's exciting.
I just like having things, and where I come from, in my bedroom, I keep all of my trinkets everywhere that I've taken from all of my travels.
-SAM-
But is there a reason why you like being surrounded by so many things? Were you deprived of things as a younger--
-ASHLEY-
No, not at all, I just--
-SAM-
It just gives you comfort to be surrounded by stuff?
-ASHLEY-
There's so many wonderful things in the world.
-ROBBIE-
Wait, wait, you have a bedroom? I always thought you just walk around in circles and lay in a patch of grass or something.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I can sleep anywhere.
It's really a great skill.
-ROBBIE-
What's your bedroom look like?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, it's just beautiful.
I have a large window that I would look out of every day and decorated so beautifully and I lived with my grandmother.
-SAM-
Oh, who's she?
-ASHLEY-
Her name is Morri.
-SAM-
Morri?
-ASHLEY-
Morri, and she's lovely.
-SAM-
Where did you hail from again?
-ASHLEY-
I'm from the Feywild.
-SAM-
Oh, that's right.
Did you mention that before, I can't remember?
-ASHLEY-
I don't know if I did.
-SAM-
Wait, is that far off?
-ASHLEY-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
It's very far off.
-SAM-
Wow.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Well, who's next?
-MATT-
I'm still thinking about the question, "what the fuck's up with that?" To the classic song, "Man, funk dat!"
-MARISHA-
I haven't rolled this good, this entire campaign thus far.
I just want to point that out.
-ASHLEY-
You're going to be getting a question.
-TALIESIN-
Six.
-LAURA-
I think my--
-LIAM-
Four.
-MATT-
♪ How come ♪ ♪ every time I turn on ♪ ♪ the radio-- ♪
-SAM-
One?! 11 over here.
-MATT-
♪ Same five songs ♪
-MARISHA-
17.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-ROBBIE-
16.
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
Unless someone's got higher.
-SAM-
But you already know everything about her.
-MARISHA-
I do know a lot about her.
-TALIESIN-
Wait, which one of you two got the lowest?
-LAURA-
I got a one.
-MATT-
Hmm!
-LIAM-
There's always another layer of the onion.
-ASHLEY-
We could make another addendum.
If you didn't want to keep asking questions, you could take the next lowest number, but I feel like it might be fun.
-MARISHA-
I do have a question, actually.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MARISHA-
And I'm sorry--
-LAURA-
You don't need to play Rollies with me in order to ask me a question.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I know, but I'm just going to take advantage of it.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
How are you feeling about your father, and everything, yes, with the Chantry-- nope.
Nope, the-- Husah-- Hubatt Corsairs.
(laughter)
-SAM-
What the fuck is up with that?
-MARISHA-
Oh, genuinely, what the fuck was up with that? We haven't talked about this.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
You had to give over your father's name for collateral.
What is going to happen?
-LAURA-
It does make me a little nervous.
-TALIESIN-
What the fuck do I know?
-MARISHA-
I don't know.
-LAURA-
I mean, I got a good feeling off of the people in there.
Like, they didn't strike me as the type that would just go out and destroy my life for no reason.
So unless we do something horrible to them, I don't think we have much to worry about.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
I hope.
-LIAM-
Sorry to bust in on your "fuck is up with that," but is home far off?
-LAURA-
I mean, it's a distance.
They'd have to travel a bit in order to get there, you know.
It's up in the...
-SAM-
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
This is why I keep mine right in front of me.
-MATT-
Taloned Highlands.
-LAURA-
Taloned Highlands! That's up in the Taloned Highlands.
-MARISHA-
She gets really excited about her hometown.
-LAURA-
I'm so excited, it's just so high and beautiful.
-TALIESIN-
Do you--
-LAURA-
Hmm?
-TALIESIN-
Do you feel like you tend to get a good reading off people, or are you a poor judge of character?
-LAURA-
Well.
It's funny, when, you know, you're actively blocking out their thoughts.
If you let it down for a second, you can get the true nature of people pretty fast.
I try not to do it, you know, too often. It can get bad.
But I mean, when I was growing up, when this started.
People can be awful.
They can seem so nice, but they can be awful.
Yeah, so, I'm not feeling too worried.
Yeah, so, I'm not feeling too worried--
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
-- about my dad, plus, he's, you know-- Why would they go after him, you know?
-MARISHA-
Do you think he's doing well? I know we left in kind of a hurry.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
I think he's, you know, it was probably a long time coming.
He was probably happy that I'm gone, and he might be doing a bit better now that I'm not there.
-SAM-
What the fuck's up with that?
-TALIESIN-
I feel like there's some context necessary for this.
-SAM-
What happened? You have a falling out with your pa?
-LAURA-
No, no, no, my dad's great! He tried, you know, when things started happening, and it wasn't like that growing up, you know, I didn't have all of this.
I don't know why it started.
It was hard for him, you know? Because I didn't want to be around very many people, and...
he just kind of-- distanced himself because he knew it made me more comfortable, and...
you know, the people in town started talking, and I think he tried to distance himself socially as well for a while to try to, you know.
Not his fault, totally.
-SAM-
From you or from the people in town?
-LAURA-
A little bit of both, you know.
-ASHLEY-
Was that very lonely for you?
-LAURA-
It was for a while, yeah.
It was really bad there for a while.
You know, when Laudna came to town, it was the first time I'd really felt any peace for a long time, so yeah.
I don't know why I didn't think to get out of town faster.
It was actually really great when we left.
-LIAM-
How long have you guys been traveling together?
-MARISHA-
Two years.
-LAURA-
Yeah, just over two years now.
-MARISHA-
We're pretty good at being hermits together.
It's nice.
-LAURA-
Drinks?
-TALIESIN-
I'm satisfied.
All right.
Oh!
-MARISHA-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
I need to roll higher.
-TALIESIN-
Gah, I keep rolling right in the middle.
-SAM-
Nine.
-MARISHA-
Nine.
-TALIESIN-
10.
-ASHLEY-
13.
-ALL-
Ooh!
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, someone's getting a question!
-SAM-
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
-TALIESIN-
Who's the highest roll?
-SAM-
I think it's Fearne asking Orym?
-LAURA-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
(gasps)
-LAURA-
Should I get out of the way?
-ASHLEY-
I was the highest?
-SAM-
13, right?
-ASHLEY-
13.
-LAURA-
That was the highest roll? Wow.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh! Oh boy. I feel like I know a lot about you as well.
-TALIESIN-
If you can't think of a question, I've got one.
-ASHLEY-
You do?
-SAM-
Yeah, we've got tons over here.
-ASHLEY-
Oh yeah, go for it!
-TALIESIN-
What are you doing in town? What are you trying to get done? What the fuck is up with that?
-MARISHA-
What the fuck is up with that?
-SAM-
Turn the screws!
-LIAM-
Boy, Fearne, I feel like you kind of just left the door open there.
-ASHLEY-
I'm really sorry.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Could've asked him what his favorite color was, I suppose.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-SAM-
If you're too uncomfortable to talk about--
-TALIESIN-
(shushing)
-ASHLEY-
You could always take a drink, and then we could ask you something else.
-MARISHA-
Then we would ask you again, the exact same question.
-LIAM-
Is that how it works, I drink and I get to skip the question?
-ASHLEY-
I'll drink with you.
-LIAM-
I'll answer the question.
-LAURA-
You'll answer the question?
-SAM-
Zone of truth!
-TALIESIN-
Little bit.
(laughter)
Little bit'll do.
-LIAM-
It's what the fuck am I doing here in town?
-TALIESIN-
What the fuck are you trying to get accomplished in town? You don't have to use any proper names, if you don't want to.
And you don't have to incriminate anybody.
-LIAM-
I am on a bit of a fact-finding mission, I guess.
I represent my home.
-TALIESIN-
Ashari?
-LIAM-
Right.
And somebody, fucked with my home.
I'm here because some breadcrumbs, maybe are leading here.
-SAM-
To the person responsible for messing with your home?
-LIAM-
Maybe.
-LAURA-
Like, in what way? Did they just destroy the village, or did they--
-LIAM-
No.
-LAURA-
Village? I don't know, is it a town, is it--
-LIAM-
It's pretty big, it's hard to reach, pretty powerful folk there.
Just there's rumors on the wind of similar trouble here, maybe.
I've just been sent to sort of sniff it out.
-TALIESIN-
So, you're high up in this city, or?
-LIAM-
The city's high, but that's not what you mean?
-TALIESIN-
They decided to send you for some reason.
-SAM-
Yeah, are you the chief enforcer, or some badass--
-TALIESIN-
Sheriff of Ashari?
-SAM-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
No, I'm good with this, but no, I'm not in charge or anything.
I happened to be traveling already for a while.
That's how I stumbled into these two.
-ASHLEY-
We did get to see his hometown, and it's quite lovely.
-LIAM-
No, but I spent time around the people in charge, and because they knew that I was traveling, they just thought that I was a good candidate.
-SAM-
Follow up, if I may.
It seems like you want to go easy on the details, which is fine.
But I'm just curious, if you don't succeed, are you worried most about disappointing someone, or disappointing yourself?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
But I'm just, I'm going to do what I can.
I'll do it while I'm traveling with these two, and maybe with you guys for a bit, if that's okay.
-SAM-
Well, we can help if we know what to look for.
-MARISHA-
In fact, I'm not sure what our next plans are.
-SAM-
Well, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Maybe we should keep that into consideration.
-LIAM-
Well, good old Ariks is, I think, able to introduce me to someone I'm here to find, but also, there's a lot of holes under this place.
What the fuck is up with that? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Literally and figuratively.
-ROBBIE-
Follow up question: Can I stop telling people we're on vacation? (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I think we can all tell I'm not the greatest at lying, sometimes, so--
-LIAM-
Fearne, Dorian--
-TALIESIN-
I was fooled.
-LIAM-
Thank you. Thank you.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Did anybody actually believe y'all were on vacation?
-ASHLEY-
Probably not.
-MARISHA-
Definitely not.
-ASHLEY-
No, didn't work?
-LAURA-
Not even close.
-ASHLEY-
Aw!
-LIAM-
Well, it's the thought that counts.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
I don't know many people that go on vacation with swords.
-LIAM-
Really? I know plenty.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Two more rounds, at least, we got two more rounds.
-LAURA-
I should say that--
-SAM-
Well, it's just you and me, right?
-LAURA-
I've been rolling and I am rolling poorly in my attempts to keep my wall up.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
So I would say I'm probably getting Open Mind at this point.
-MATT-
One more drink, and I think you'll cross that threshold.
-SAM-
Why don't y'all roll, because only me and Laudna are left to answer?
-MARISHA-
Correct.
-SAM-
Maybe y'all should just roll to see who asks.
-MARISHA-
Should we just roll between the two of us?
-SAM-
Yeah, to see who answers first.
Double Rollies.
-MARISHA-
Double Rollies.
-SAM-
Three.
-MARISHA-
16!
-SAM-
So does that mean you-- Well, you choose.
-MARISHA-
Well, I guess it's whatever, you know.
-LAURA-
I think you answer first.
-TALIESIN-
You answer first.
-SAM-
Okay, I answer first.
-TALIESIN-
16.
-LIAM-
Oh, I got a 20.
I have a question.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Sounds legit.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that's legit.
-LAURA-
It was a 20.
It is a 20.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
I've traveled a decent amount.
Probably not as much as some.
One time I met someone sort of like you.
-SAM-
Really, where was that?
-LIAM-
Someone visited home.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LIAM-
But they were nothing like you.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LIAM-
And I'm just still kind of blown away.
I don't know what I'm asking.
I don't know how old you are.
I don't know how you came to be.
Are the people, the others that you talked about, Oatmeal and Pussy, are they-- (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Shit.
-LIAM-
-- the only ones you ever knew?
-SAM-
And Apple Pie.
-LIAM-
And Apple Pie, sorry.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, and Apple Pie, that's right.
-LIAM-
I really like oatmeal.
-LAURA-
Mm.
-SAM-
Are they the only ones like me I ever knew?
-LIAM-
Yeah, or are there more, or where do you come from, and what the fuck is up with that?
-SAM-
Well, it ap-- it ap-- it ap--
-ASHLEY-
Uh-oh.
-SAM-
I--
-TALIESIN-
Stop it!
-SAM-
I, I...
-ASHLEY-
What's happening?
-LIAM-
(clanging)
-MARISHA-
Is this how he dodges questions?
-SAM-
No, not at all.
-LIAM-
Are you okay?
-SAM-
I just don't, I...
-MARISHA-
You have no memory?
-ASHLEY-
Do you not have access to that?
-MARISHA-
You don't have access?
-LIAM-
Access, what do you mean?
-ROBBIE-
I don't understand, either.
-LAURA-
What does it mean?
-ROBBIE-
Sounds right.
-MARISHA-
Fearne and I don't really know.
-ASHLEY-
I don't know what I'm saying.
-MARISHA-
Ashley and Marisha are just really excited.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, okay, I can pick this up.
-SAM-
D-Dancer, Dancer, Dance-Dancer created me.
-LIAM-
I asked too much.
Do you know how old you are?
-SAM-
I was with Dancer for almost two years.
So two.
-LAURA-
All right.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
You're two?
-SAM-
Well, yeah, but you know, I don't age like y'all, so.
-ROBBIE-
Careful, she loves babies.
-TALIESIN-
I can addendum into this.
-SAM-
She loves babies?
-ASHLEY-
Can I just? Come here.
(laughter)
-SAM-
If it makes you feel good, then yes, of course.
-LAURA-
You hear sloshing.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I can hear the water, the drink in there.
-ROBBIE-
I have a question.
Can I avsk a question?
-SAM-
Can you avks a question?
-ROBBIE-
I'm sorry, can I ask a question?
-LIAM-
Can I get another round for my friend here, please?
-TALIESIN-
We got the bottle, there you go.
-SAM-
Yes, mi'lord.
-ROBBIE-
That was funny.
Oh, I have to ask you a question first.
Does he ever, brr, does he power down ever?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, they do the sleep mode, sleep mode!
-SAM-
I go into a stasis state.
-ROBBIE-
When you're in sleep mode, do you do dream?
-TALIESIN-
Ooh!
-ASHLEY-
Good question!
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
-TALIESIN-
Whoa!
-SAM-
Boy, oh boy, that is a great question.
-TALIESIN-
Wow!
-LIAM-
Is it sheep?
-TALIESIN-
Is it Oatmeal?
-SAM-
You know what, I don't think I've ever dreamed yet, but then again, maybe I have and I just don't know what it's like.
Dreaming is, I've heard, y'all soul-touched folks talk about it, it's like memories and stuff that you have at night, right?
-LIAM-
Sometimes.
-LAURA-
Sometimes, or it could just be--
-SAM-
Or imaginations?
-ASHLEY-
But sometimes it doesn't make sense.
-TALIESIN-
Mostly it doesn't make sense.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-SAM-
I don't see any reason why I would have one, but I don't see any reason why I would not.
I just haven't yet.
I don't think.
-ASHLEY-
Do you ever wake up and sometimes you're just in such a bad awful mood and you don't know why?
-SAM-
(laughs) No.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Sometimes that can be a dream and you're just thrown off all day.
I thought maybe--
-SAM-
No, why would you start the day with a sourpuss?
-ASHLEY-
It's a good question.
-TALIESIN-
Maybe you should intentionally shoot for it.
Like sometimes, before you go into stasis, just--
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Have an intention.
-SAM-
An intention, like something to think about, or?
-TALIESIN-
"I'm going to have a dream.
I'm going to dream about," I don't know, something, whatever the fuck you like.
-SAM-
All right.
This is a great goal.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
I can do that tonight.
-TALIESIN-
I think it's a great idea.
-ROBBIE-
If you have a dream, let us know.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-SAM-
You okay?
-ROBBIE-
I'm fine.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
I'm going to surreptitiously finish Dorian's drink when he's not looking.
So he has less.
-MARISHA-
Also, this whole time, I've been gathering scrap chicken bones, and I've been-- and other leftovers, and I've been under the table, just spinning some of my twine.
-MATT-
Terrifying.
Great, all right.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
Little Blair Witch doll? Sort of thing?
-LIAM-
Who gets to ask the last question?
-MARISHA-
It's not finished.
-LIAM-
Are those teeth?
-LAURA-
Rollies.
-TALIESIN-
Who gets to ask the last one? Boo.
-LIAM-
Dang.
-ASHLEY-
Cocked.
-LAURA-
Hmm!
-ROBBIE-
11.
-LIAM-
Seven.
-TALIESIN-
Two.
-LAURA-
17.
-ASHLEY-
13.
-SAM-
You go.
-MARISHA-
Did you roll?
-SAM-
Oh wait, but she knows you already, I rolled a 19.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
Do it!
-LAURA-
Yeah, you probably got a good one.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-SAM-
Ooh, there's really, I don't know much about you, Laudna, at all.
-MARISHA-
You don't.
-SAM-
You're from a place called Whitestone, that's kind of all I know.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
Boy, boy, what do we ask? I need to huddle up with everybody else for a second here.
-TALIESIN-
No, no, no, we can give suggestions.
-SAM-
What's good here? It's a deep well.
-TALIESIN-
Has she always been that way, or did some shit happen, is a good one.
-SAM-
I don't want to probe into her physical--
-TALIESIN-
Literally what we're here-- I mean, we just probed into yours, I wouldn't've--
-SAM-
But I'm okay with that.
-TALIESIN-
I'm well aware of what I've got going on.
-MARISHA-
You can ask me anything.
-SAM-
All right.
-MARISHA-
I'm not too shy.
-SAM-
Are you dead? What the fuck is up with that? (laughter) (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Um! You know.
I'm not entirely sure.
I think so.
-SAM-
You think you're dead?!
-MARISHA-
I think I'm some cross, in between life and death.
Not--
-LIAM-
What.
-TALIESIN-
Elaborate.
-MARISHA-
-- not totally alive, but not totally dead.
-TALIESIN-
But what happened?
-MARISHA-
Well, I definitely died!
-SAM-
Wait. Okay?
-MARISHA-
Then I just--
-SAM-
How did that happen? Well, okay, you just tell your story.
-MARISHA-
I died, and then I woke up.
I woke up, and I was surrounded by a lot of other corpses, and all of Whitestone was in a complete panic, run amok.
Just death and disease and nightmare everywhere, and I didn't know what happened, so I ran.
But yeah, I haven't really aged.
-SAM-
How long ago was that?
-MARISHA-
30 years.
-SAM-
30 years?!
-TALIESIN-
Whoa!
-ROBBIE-
So you were this age when you died?
-TALIESIN-
You look great!
-SAM-
How old were you when you passed away?
-MARISHA-
20.
-SAM-
Do you happen to know how long you were dead for?
-MARISHA-
I don't think long.
48 hours, couple of days.
-TALIESIN-
(whistles)
-SAM-
So you're 50?
-MARISHA-
I'm 50.
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit!
-LAURA-
She can kick! (laughter)
-LIAM-
And stretch! (laughter)
-SAM-
And kick!
-MARISHA-
I'm 50!
-ASHLEY-
Do you remember anything about your previous life?
-MARISHA-
Oh, yes.
I remember all of it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Absolutely.
-LIAM-
You're not just an elf or--
-MARISHA-
No, I was a human.
-LIAM-
How can you be dead?
-SAM-
And who brought you back and how?
-TALIESIN-
Shit happens.
It's a weird fucking world.
-SAM-
You said you died and then you woke up.
There was an in between there?
-MARISHA-
Yes! Yes, I always had innate magical capabilities when I was a young girl.
So I don't know, I think whatever happened in Whitestone on that night, I think I got hit with some sort of necromantic magic.
It was like a blast, it just, I don't know, just kind of hit me.
And then I was alive.
But here, look! I'm going to grab-- Can you feel things?
-SAM-
Yeah, sure.
-MARISHA-
Hm.
You feel a heartbeat every 20 seconds.
-SAM-
Oh, you're very athletic.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
(laughter)
-SAM-
So your heart does beat.
-MARISHA-
It does, just very slowly.
-SAM-
You have hopes, you have fears.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
You have loves.
-MARISHA-
Of course.
-SAM-
Sounds like you're alive to me.
-LIAM-
When you died, was everything at home good before everything went bad, or were things bad?
-MARISHA-
It was complicated.
We were simple farmers on the outskirts of town, lived a very humble life, didn't have a lot of money.
As such, my parents were a bit naive.
They weren't really connected to the goings-on in the political specter of Whitestone.
I think we just walked into a bit of a trap.
They were wanting to give me a better life, and they knew that their daughter, magical capabilities could maybe go forth and become something more.
Unfortunately, the stewards of Whitestone at the time had different opinions.
-TALIESIN-
Did your parents know what happened to you?
-MARISHA-
They're dead.
-TALIESIN-
Any family left?
-MARISHA-
I don't think so.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LIAM-
I'm very sorry.
-SAM-
These people in Whitestone, the stewards, you said.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-SAM-
They killed you?
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm, the Briarwoods.
-SAM-
The Briarwoods.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm!
-SAM-
We should find them and--
-MARISHA-
Oh, they're gone! They're long dead, too.
-SAM-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) One of them kind of pops in my head, though, every now and then.
-SAM-
What's that mean, what?
-LIAM-
Say that again?
-TALIESIN-
What?
-MARISHA-
Well, voices in my head.
-SAM-
Oh, kind of like Imogen?
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm! Different.
-LAURA-
Kind of.
-MARISHA-
I think it's why we bonded so quickly, and I think just whatever magical bond we have, just works.
-ROBBIE-
Two years together.
What were you doing for the previous 28?
-MARISHA-
Just running from town to town.
I would go and I would find the little shacks in the woods that were abandoned and then I would fix them up.
Then, inevitably, the town would be like, "Oh, there's a witch in the woods, oh, kill her! Lorelei, bleh!" Then some cleric would come or holy person would come and be like, "Gah! Death to the undead witch! Mah!" And then I would run, and I would do that again and again and again.
-SAM-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm!
-SAM-
That would make a cool TV show.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Very repetitive.
It was very much a little cabin fixer-upper type lifestyle.
-SAM-
But you're okay now being dead? It doesn't cause you sadness anymore?
-LIAM-
This is wildest conversation, I swear.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, this game always ends well.
-SAM-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
I think I've just gotten used to it, you know? I've been surrounded by death for quite some time now, so.
Mm-mm! (Like "I don't know")
-SAM-
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
That's fucking great.
That was a great fucking story.
-SAM-
That was a great game.
-MARISHA-
Did I do it right?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, killer, killer.
-ASHLEY-
That was so good!
-SAM-
Thank you, Ashton, for that amazing idea.
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, that's the end of that one.
-SAM-
Now what do we do?
-TALIESIN-
I think now we sleep this off and see how we feel in the morning.
Is everyone okay after that last one? Does anyone feel like they want to get into more trouble? I don't think I'm up to getting into more trouble.
-ASHLEY-
Well, would you play us a song, my lord?
-ROBBIE-
Hmm, uh.
-LAURA-
Oh, Prince Dorian, please play us a beautiful song.
I can't wait to hear it.
-ROBBIE-
Do not like that nickname.
-SAM-
Do you know "Jordan, Fetch My Whiskey," by any chance?
-ROBBIE-
"Jordan, Fetch My Whiskey"?
-ASHLEY-
It's a classic.
-ROBBIE-
Is that a joke? He's Jordan, right? No? Never mind.
I'm going to tune my lute, but I am not tuning my lute.
It's boing, boing, boing, boing, woing, woing.
It's really out of tune, it's very bad.
-LIAM-
How about something from your childhood?
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-SAM-
Yeah, like one of your royal songs.
-ROBBIE-
I'll pull out the flute.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
I will try to play a lovely genasi ballad.
-MATT-
Go for it. Go ahead and roll a performance check.
-ROBBIE-
Fingers crossed.
♪ It is not lovely ♪ (laughter) It's all right, it's a 13.
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-MATT-
13's fine.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, I forgot how high my modifier was.
-LIAM-
You're also sloshed.
-ROBBIE-
Yes, 13 for a sloshed character's not bad.
-MATT-
It's not too bad.
(laughter)
Asshole.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
"Jazz is chaos."
-LIAM-
"Dorian's Failed Performance Check." (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Hurtful.
All right, I'll toot my flute for whatever 13 can get me.
-MATT-
Well, would you like to describe the mood it carries?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, it's obviously a little loose, but it's light more than anything.
It's slightly dissonant.
You know, if you're listening to it and you're watching the fire, you could almost be fooled to think that the sound and the rhythm is affecting the way the flame moves, and it's very peaceful.
It's not quite a lullaby, but it does put your heart at ease when you hear it.
-LIAM-
This motherfucker.
-MARISHA-
That's pretty great.
-LAURA-
If someone were, perchance, accidentally reading your thoughts while you were playing this music, what sort of emotions would you be feeling on the inside right now?
-MATT-
Well, you are welcome to roll a wisdom saving throw, if you wish to resist it.
-ROBBIE-
Ugh.
Do I feel-- that's a good-- Does one feel this when you--
-MATT-
It's less about them actively resisting it, and more if they're guarded--
-LAURA-
I'm not trying to push into your thoughts right now.
-ROBBIE-
It's private, but I'll roll against it since it's private.
-MATT-
Okay.
You are pretty trashed.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-MATT-
So I'll say--
-ROBBIE-
Disadvantage?
-MATT-
-- disadvantage.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
Not going to need it.
That's a one.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Open book! Open book!
-LAURA-
-- whisper it to me?
-ROBBIE-
What?
-LAURA-
Do you want to whisper it to me?
-MATT-
Yeah, go over and whisper in her ear.
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
(cheering)
-ASHLEY-
Inter-party whispers!
-SAM-
Guys.
-TALIESIN-
I've been sitting on this all week.
It worked better than I could've hoped.
Oh!
-LIAM-
PvP.
-SAM-
Guys, besides NordVPN--
-MATT-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
-- which is fantastic, Kith &amp; Kin is available now at criticalrolebooks.com.
Don't forget ghostfiregaming.com/fables-criticalrole.
-LIAM-
Yep.
-SAM-
And other things.
(laughter)
All right, to bed and then we decide in the morning where we're going or should we tell where we're going now, so that Matt knows what the fuck to think about?
-MATT-
I'll figure it out.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Was it "Matt, Bring Me Another whiskey?" I thought it was Jordan-- Matt, fetch me whiskey.
-MATT-
You hear the heavy, familiar footsteps of Ishir come up to the second floor with another bottle, and be like, "Hey, going to need another?"
-TALIESIN-
No, I think we're going to just, rooms, room, rooms, rooms.
I think we're good.
-MATT-
"All right, how many rooms we got? Seven separate rooms?"
-LAURA-
Oh, we can--
-MARISHA-
Yeah, we're good.
TALIESIN and SAM: We'll share.
-ASHLEY-
Did you guys want to?
-LIAM-
We could do what we did on the road.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(agreeable grunt)
-SAM-
The airship trio.
-MATT-
"All right, all right."
-TALIESIN-
Three big rooms.
-MATT-
"Yeah, three big rooms.
If you wouldn't mind, that'll put you at-- Let's say, gold and a half."
-TALIESIN-
I think I--
-ASHLEY-
I have it, it's fine.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, wow, okay.
-MATT-
"Thank you kindly, miss."
-ASHLEY-
You're welcome.
-MATT-
"All right."
-TALIESIN-
I like this place.
-MATT-
"Sleep it off well." Heads back downstairs.
-TALIESIN-
See you at breakfast!
-ASHLEY-
May I also have the extra bottle, please?
-MATT-
"Oh, well, that'll run you-- we'll say about-- About five gold for the bottle."
-ASHLEY-
Okay, great.
I'll give you 10 silver instead.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Can I pay you in ones? (laughter)
-LIAM-
<i>Eins. Zwei.</i>
-ASHLEY-
Nine.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Yeah, no, sorry, honey, that's not how it works.
I have to make a profit to keep the business running and I paid more than that for the bottle when it was supplied to me."
-ASHLEY-
I understand, I'm not from here, so.
-MATT-
"But five gold."
-TALIESIN-
I got this.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no, that's too much.
-TALIESIN-
Too fucking late.
Too fucking late. Five gold.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
"You got a good friend here in Ashton.
You, I'm glad you got a friend, Ashton." Gives you the bottle.
-ASHLEY-
Thank you.
-TALIESIN-
Would've charged me less if I had asked.
Just saying.
-MATT-
Keys are distributed.
You have the three rooms at your disposal.
-MARISHA-
Well, before we depart, I grab Dorian.
I know you are feeling just so guilty about poor Bertrand.
-ROBBIE-
Mm.
-MARISHA-
I just-- Here, I just wanted you to have this.
It's a Bertrand doll--
-ROBBIE-
Fuck.
-MARISHA-
-- made with--
-ROBBIE-
I knew it.
-MARISHA-
-- chicken bones, and I took the hair that I cut off of Bertrand to make his actual hair.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-LIAM-
True Detective, season five.
-MARISHA-
He's got a little cane.
Maybe he'll remind him of you, when you get sad.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, Laudna.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Oh, Laudna! (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Oh, Laudna.
(laughter) He is <i>lovely</i>.
You are so talented.
-MARISHA-
Oh, just stop, stop.
-ROBBIE-
I will treasure tiny Bertrand forever.
-MATT-
As you look at it, the thing that affixes the head to it, something gives and the head just goes (crick) on its own.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Does it come with little puppeteer, like--
-MARISHA-
Oh, well, I could give you some string if you--
-ROBBIE-
That's okay, Laudna, I'd rather just look at it.
I'd rather just look at it.
Oh, it's so gorgeous.
-MARISHA-
Let me know. I could teach you some puppeteering.
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I'm going to try to put these greasy chicken bones in my bag or something for the time being.
Thank you, thank you.
-LAURA-
The Feywild.
That's amazing.
-ASHLEY-
Well, you know, it's very cool.
It's a very cool place, and you know, it's home.
-LAURA-
How did you go from there to here?
-ASHLEY-
Well, I just walked.
-LAURA-
Wow.
I didn't know that was something someone could do.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I guess it is.
-LAURA-
You got to show me how to do it.
I swear, I didn't even know the Feywild was a real place.
You know, people have talked about it, but I thought it was just stories.
-ASHLEY-
(gasps) Really?
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
We'll have to go there sometime.
-LAURA-
I would love that!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I would love to introduce you to my grandma, and all of my friends there, and I have such a wonderful group of people that I just love there so much.
-LAURA-
How long have you been on Exandria?
-ASHLEY-
Well, let's see.
Maybe seven months?
-MATT-
Give or take, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Seven or eight months, something around there.
Not very long.
-LAURA-
Wow!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Mr. Grass? I just want to apologize.
I feel like maybe I went too far.
-SAM-
Not at all.
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a more satisfactory answer.
I just don't have the information, I think.
-LIAM-
I felt like I might've made you uncomfortable, and that wasn't my intention to--
-SAM-
Not at all. I--
-LIAM-
I don't play a lot of drinking games.
-SAM-
Me neither.
When everyone goes to sleep, I think I'm going to hang upside down and just drain myself, because I don't think this is good.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I think I'm still holding him.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Could you just spin me over?
-ASHLEY-
-- turn you upside down?
-SAM-
And maybe hit my--
-MATT-
As soon as you finish hitting (vomits) just dribbles out.
(laughter) Like a turned over gas can.
-LIAM-
Just hold him for a minute, and let the last of it, yep.
(popping) (laughter, groaning)
-MATT-
Yeah, it works.
-ROBBIE-
Yes.
-MATT-
It works.
-TALIESIN-
Doesn't seem like it went anywhere.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Is there any waste, though?
-ASHLEY-
Waste not, want not.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
I mean, when I eat a pie, and something happens, it goes away, but I've seen you eat a copper or two.
Does it-- is there--
-SAM-
I was not built with a poop chute of any sort.
-LIAM-
So what happens to the little pieces that you eat?
-SAM-
Of copper?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Or other things? They get absorbed into my body to make repairs.
-LAURA-
Oh wow.
-LIAM-
And there's nothing left over?
-SAM-
It's right here.
It's all over me.
-ASHLEY-
I want to look in there so bad.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
You keep coming back to that.
-ASHLEY-
I know, it's just so interesting.
-SAM-
I'm not sure I like the way your eyes look right now.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
(goat bleating)
-ASHLEY-
I won't hurt you, I promise.
-SAM-
Next time I need a significant repair, I'll let you come--
-ASHLEY-
I would love to help.
-SAM-
Yes, yes, absolutely.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Thank you so much.
-TALIESIN-
Sleep?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-SAM-
Let's do it.
-TALIESIN-
If you've got shit to be handled in town, you should handle it with a group.
I'm just saying.
This is a good way to handle your shit.
You should handle your shit.
-MARISHA-
I agree.
-TALIESIN-
There are people who will help you handle it.
I think I've finally had too much.
I'm going to sleep.
All right.
-LAURA-
We need a group name!
-TALIESIN-
Good talk.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, the Shit Handlers.
Yeah, it's good, the Shit Handlers.
-LAURA-
I don't like it.
-LIAM-
Just before we all break for bed, really, this is when we're coming up with this?
-LAURA-
Shit Handlers.
-TALIESIN-
It feels derivative.
-LIAM-
Sit back down.
If we're going to have this discussion, let's have it.
-ASHLEY-
Shit back down.
-LIAM-
Shit back down, and you'll hear a tale.
(laughter)
-SAM-
We're going to choose a group name right now?
-LIAM-
Well--
-LAURA-
I think we should.
-LIAM-
You keep bringing it up.
-LAURA-
Well, I just feel like it's weird.
-LIAM-
Well, we just met.
-LAURA-
We can't make our contract.
-TALIESIN-
Next round.
-ROBBIE-
I'm so sleepy.
I'm so-- Laudna, may I? Mm.
Oh, you're like the cool side of a pillow.
-MARISHA-
You just hear my shoulder dislocate.
-ROBBIE-
(yelps) (laughter)
-LIAM-
There's just a little bit of bone piercing through.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Right in the temple.
-LAURA-
I should actually be forthright.
If we continue to sit here much longer, I'm going to be reading all you guys' thoughts.
It might be best to--
-TALIESIN-
We're going to get--
-LIAM-
Oh, early to bed, early to rise.
Night, everybody.
-TALIESIN-
And I'm out.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
As we go to bed, I'm just going to, right before I shut down, I'm going to just think: Dream! Dream!
-MATT-
Aw.
-LAURA-
And you hear me say: I think you can do it.
-SAM-
I'm dreaming.
(laughter)
(shutting down noise)
-MATT-
You all find your various rooms to rest.
Laudna, as you're starting to doze off a bit, in that bit of gentle quiet, you do hear a familiar whisper.
It says, "Careful, dear.
Some things are meant to be kept secret."
-MARISHA-
Oh! Oh, hello, oh my god! It's been so long since I've heard from you! What have you been up to?
-MATT-
(exhales)
-MARISHA-
Oh, come on, D, just tell me.
-MATT-
"Please, just be careful."
"Please, just be careful."
-MARISHA-
(scoffs) I didn't say anything that's not, like, public knowledge.
So back off. (chuckles)
-MATT-
(exhales) That's the end of it.
-MARISHA-
Good night!
-LAURA-
Is she talking to you?
-MARISHA-
Yes. She's mad because I got chatty.
-LAURA-
Has she ever done anything, if you get in trouble with her?
-MARISHA-
Like, have I gotten in trouble with her?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I mean, I know she's been pissy before, but has it ever come to anything?
-MARISHA-
I don't know. Has it ever come to anything?
-MATT-
It's come to tense conversations.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And threats of denying her gift.
-MARISHA-
Her gifts, right.
-MATT-
But not yet.
-SAM-
Gifts.
-TALIESIN-
Wow, that took me that long to put it together.
Fuck! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
She'll sometimes, you know--
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-MARISHA-
-- be like, ooh, I helped made you.
You'd be nothing without me.
I can take what I can give, blah, blah, blah.
She does that sometimes, but she's never really done it.
I don't know.
-LAURA-
We got to get into that institute.
-MARISHA-
I know. (sighs) If I can just keep strengthening all my skills without her--
-LAURA-
You won't need her.
-MARISHA-
I won't need her.
-LAURA-
If she's listening.
-MARISHA-
Oh, she probably is.
It's an excellent point, though.
I've never really strayed far from her until recently.
-LAURA-
Right.
-MARISHA-
Well.
I'll keep you posted if she starts getting aggressive.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
One of the reasons I think we need a group name.
The sooner we have it, the sooner we have a contract, the sooner we can get in there.
Right?
-MARISHA-
That's true.
We'll keep thinking on it.
Maybe something will inspire us in the next day or two.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
How are you doing? You looked a little pale there at the end.
-LAURA-
Oh, no, I was just-- I was trying really hard not to get into everybody's head, you know what I mean?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I sneaked into Dorian's for a second.
-MARISHA-
What'd you see? Come on, tell me.
-LAURA-
Just him with his mom.
It was quite nice.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Yeah, he's a sweetheart.
-MARISHA-
He is a sweet boy.
-LAURA-
Sleep well.
-MARISHA-
All right, you too.
Wake me up if you have any other nightmares.
All right?
-LAURA-
You know I will.
-MATT-
Okay.
The evening comes to you.
Rest, necessary physical respite, after a very arduously (laughs) damaging experience, but through the night, you get your long rest.
So you can go ahead and mark that.
-SAM-
Oh yeah.
-MATT-
Uncertain if dreams found you, Fresh Cut Grass, but there is a little bit of joy in going into your familiar stasis with a goal in mind.
-SAM-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
But nothing out of the ordinary.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
With that, eventually, the morning comes, the warmth of day begins to creep in through your various chambers, and the day is yours.
As you all begin to, one by one, muster yourself, your materials, your equipment and then wander downstairs.
You begin to gather again on the bottom floor of the Spire by Fire and gather once more.
What would you like to do?
-ASHLEY-
(yawns, muttering).
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Morning, all.
-TALIESIN-
Morning.
-ROBBIE-
Morning.
-LAURA-
No, but what are we doing today?
-SAM-
We have a few options.
-LAURA-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
(gasps)
-SAM-
As I see-- Oh, what?
-ASHLEY-
Did it happen?
-MARISHA-
Oh, yes, did you dream?
-SAM-
I don't think so.
I mean, nothing out of the ordinary happened, I'm sorry.
-TALIESIN-
You twitched a couple times.
-SAM-
I did?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
That's progress.
-TALIESIN-
I hadn't seen it before.
-ASHLEY-
I feel like I heard you through the walls, saying, like, "Oh, no, no, no."
-SAM-
I had bad dreams? That's horrible.
-ASHLEY-
I'm just lying.
-SAM-
Oh.
(laughter)
Well, that's reassuring.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I should've said like, "Oh--" something else.
-MARISHA-
Pathological liar Fearne.
Oh my god.
-MATT-
I love it.
-SAM-
Well, we have, now that we've learned a bit about each other from last night, we know that some of us have specific goals, finding your quarry.
-LIAM-
I have a line.
I just need to keep checking in.
-SAM-
We have that that we could pursue today.
We could go to the Starlight Conservatory.
Is that what it's called?
-LAURA-
We can go there, but it's useless until we get that contract.
-SAM-
Okay, okay, okay.
Then there's also the investigating what caused those chairs and tables to come to life? I don't know how we would--
-TALIESIN-
That's been bothering me for a while.
That's been bothering me this whole time.
-LAURA-
That was right outside of here.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Or tracking down the source or intended recipient of that brumestone that we stumbled upon.
-MARISHA-
Very curious.
-SAM-
Or I think-- Didn't Lord Eshtertoss say that they would have some more work for us, and then, possibly, did someone else offer us work, too? Am I forgetting? I feel like someone offered us work.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, we could let the--
-LIAM-
Hubatt Corsairs.
-LAURA-
Corsairs.
We could let the Corsairs know that we did away with old Dooger.
-TALIESIN-
I like that idea.
-SAM-
Dugger.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Should probably ask Lord Eshtertoss first.
-LAURA-
If that's all right?
-SAM-
I think we did already, didn't we?
-LAURA-
Hmm, I don't know.
-SAM-
Yeah, we talked to him and said, "Is it okay that we didn't use your name?" He said, "Only if things are cool."
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, so they might like us more, and then we could say his name, and then we could create that introduction.
-SAM-
What do y'all think?
-LIAM-
Technically, we did them a favor, too, so.
-TALIESIN-
We did.
-SAM-
Is that the most pressing matter, or is there something, should we investigate, pull the thread of your person that you're here to find?
-LIAM-
Well, that lies with Lord Eshtertoss.
-SAM-
Oh, it does?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
All things lie with Lord Eshtertoss.
-SAM-
I guess we go there?
-MARISHA-
Do you think he's had any developments in the past 24 hours?
-ASHLEY-
You gave him the goop, right?
-LAURA-
I did.
-TALIESIN-
We did.
The goop was given.
-MATT-
It was given in the evening of last night.
So it's been maybe 12 hours.
-TALIESIN-
I say we tell the Corsairs what happened, and then see if it's time to-- if that seems to-- that way, at least, we're cementing a relationship.
-LIAM-
Yeah, and we just saw Eshteross last night.
It seems a little--
-ROBBIE-
Do we remember the good password? Wasn't there a good one/bad one?
-LAURA-
It's "come to loosen the share." The snare.
-ASHLEY-
We've come to loosen the snare.
-LAURA-
The share. (laugh) The snave, the shane, is I think what it looks like what I wrote.
-ASHLEY-
It's the snave.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
Snare.
-SAM-
So to the Corsairs, then?
-LAURA-
Yes, let's do it.
Back over the bridge and down, because we like to go--
-SAM-
To the Lantern Spire?
-LAURA-
We love going back and forth between that, so.
-MATT-
Yeah, you do.
You guys keep jumping back and forth.
Well-tread territory.
Thankfully, the two areas that have an actual, physical bridge that you don't have to pay to get across each way, so that helps, too.
Okay, gathering your things, finishing a modest breakfast, you head over towards to the Fatewalk Bridge across to the Lantern Spire, and then, following the familiar path that Ashton leads ahead of you, once again, you head to the Elder Post tunnel system beneath, into the early morning air of the bazaar, in which case, it is much quieter.
You can see a lot of the bustle you saw when you initially approached is still in a closed-down state and a lot of the spaces are empty.
A lot of the carts have been pulled away and you have no idea where they've gone.
It seems like it would be too much for everyone to remove and then reset up every single day, but you've also seen some people quickly disassemble and condense their shopping experience into a very compact and very rapidly escaping mechanism.
But as you head into the space, the low oil lanterns still glowing about, there is still a handful of individuals, a few dozen that are wandering around the outskirts of what is now currently the central open space with a handful of smaller structures that are either still shuddered or in the process of being set up for the day.
-TALIESIN-
Is the baker around, out of curiosity?
-MATT-
You can certainly check around.
Go ahead and make a perception, either a perception check or a charisma check to ask around.
-TALIESIN-
Perception check.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Charisma's a thing.
Nope, I got a one.
-MATT-
Oh, buddy. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Had a drink this morning.
-MATT-
Looking around, you do not have any sight on the Shadow Baker, and there's probably a good chance that either he has not arrived yet, or is not wanting to be found.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LIAM-
As we finish this last bit of the stretch of the journey-- Hey, I want to role play with you for a second.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Orym walks alongside Imogen, and when he thinks that most of the group are not paying attention, he looks up at her and says: Imogen?
-LAURA-
Yeah?
-LIAM-
That thing that you do, you know, that thing that you do.
-LAURA-
Yeah?
-LIAM-
Are you doing that to us? Like all the time?
-LAURA-
No, I'm really not, I swear.
-LIAM-
Or a little bit?
-LAURA-
No, I'm trying not to.
I don't want to.
-LIAM-
Okay.
Is there anything that we can do to make that--
-LAURA-
Easier?
-LIAM-
Easier on you.
-LAURA-
Yeah, don't think.
-LIAM-
Other than 50 feet away.
Don't think?
-LAURA-
Don't think ever.
No, I swear, it's-- you know, I've worked a long time at blocking it out.
It just sometimes gets a little harder.
It's easier if there's less people.
This size of a group is something.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
But-- You know what I've noticed since I've been around y'all? Which is really interesting.
Like, all the time, it almost sounds like a-- like a swarm of bees, you know?
-LIAM-
We are a swarm of bees?
-LAURA-
No, no, no.
Everyone, everything is just so much.
But-- and it's the same sort of feeling that I had with Laudna the first time I met her.
It was there, she was there, but she was almost like a different a different pitch than everybody else.
It was musical, it wasn't painful like everybody else.
-LIAM-
And you're getting that with us?
-LAURA-
It's not quite there, but I'm getting used to the sounds, so it doesn't feel as intrusive.
-LIAM-
That's a good sign.
-LAURA-
That's a great sign.
Something I've never experienced before.
-LIAM-
Okay.
Well, I like you.
I'm not too worried about it, but I just wanted to know if there was anything...
-LAURA-
To be done?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I think if you wear, like, a metal hat, that'll help a lot.
-LIAM-
What does that do? What the fuck is up with that?
-LAURA-
I don't know.
(laughter)
I think it blocks out the signal or something, like a lead hat.
Let's give it a try.
-LIAM-
Are you fucking with me?
-LAURA-
No, of course not.
-LIAM-
Insight check.
(laughter)
Oh, that's okay.
It's just a 13.
-LAURA-
Oh, I'm fucking with you.
-LIAM-
Ah.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
[Inaudible] helmets for all.
-LAURA-
You know what? It might work.
-LIAM-
Maybe Fresh Cut Grass could help.
-MATT-
That's the group name, The Neatos.
-ALL-
The Neatos!
-LIAM-
All right, thank you for role playing with me.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So glancing around, no sign of the Shadow Baker.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Formal.
-TALIESIN-
Would you care to role play?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, yes, I would.
-TALIESIN-
Ah!
-ROBBIE-
Sounds delightful.
-ASHLEY-
She also got me a really cool pouch.
-LIAM-
That's why I did-- I wanted to say.
I knew you were giving her a gift, and I didn't want to interrupt--
-ASHLEY-
Has a bunch of ferns on it.
-LIAM-
-- but then I wanted to talk to you.
-LAURA-
I was like, "It's Fearne's pouch!" This is so stupid.
-MARISHA-
So cute!
-MATT-
Hey, it works.
Unless you have any other business, the Root Trader is findable without issue.
But is there anything else you wish to do while you're here?
-TALIESIN-
Nothing pressing.
-LAURA-
No, seems pretty good.
-MATT-
Heading to the Root Trader, it is currently closed.
It is not yet open this time of the morning.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
But you do, glancing through the somewhat cloudy glass windows, you do see some movement inside.
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
(knocking)
-MATT-
There's a quiet pause.
One of the curtains pulls aside, and on the other side, you can see Heron, the feathered individual that led you into the interior, glancing past with his wide bird eye, like--
-LAURA-
We've come to loosen the snare.
-MATT-
(groans) "It's so early." He goes and opens the door.
"Come on, come on, come on, fine, fine, fine." Lets you inside. You don't even see Ovalia there yet.
Heron's taking care of the interior.
Hurries across, leads you into the same upwards spiral and opens into the same hatch chamber.
This area is nowhere near as crowded as it was last time.
You can see maybe six individuals in this room, and now that you have a better look within and less tension, Heron holds the lantern forth, you can see there's some cots in the corner.
This is definitely just a resting hangout space, like a safe house.
You can see there's stacks of bunk beds and a few cots.
You can see there's some storage crates.
You can see there's a number of chairs.
You can see there's bundles of general goods in storage.
At just a quick glance with the light around, and you see as Heron says, "Come loosen this snare, in." (laughter) Tells you all to get up there, and then, closes the latch behind him.
He's not even staying behind this time.
He's just letting you guys in.
As it closes, one of the figures, the familiar hooded figure sitting in the back, arms crossed, glances over and looks at all of you.
He goes over and shakes awake somebody who's snoring loudly on one of the nearby nicer, larger situations of bedding.
Quickly (gasps) pulls up with a knife towards the hooded figure, leans back, gives a nudge and a nod over in your direction.
You can see it's Yash.
Yash is rubbing his eyes a bit.
"I'm terribly sorry.
Don't do that again.
It could've gone a lot worse." Puts the blade away.
"Give me just a second.
It's a bit early." He gets up.
-MARISHA-
Apparently, he knows us.
-MATT-
Stretches.
-TALIESIN-
Dreams, that's what'll do that to you.
-MATT-
Starts stretching, touching his toes a bit.
-ASHLEY-
I'll join in.
That's actually a good idea.
-SAM-
Do some calisthenics.
-MATT-
"Yeah, see? Not a bad idea to do.
All right, if you want to stretch with me, you're welcome to.
I'm not going to stop you." (groans) Takes a water skin--
-SAM-
Starts going, zoom, zoom, zoom.
Just around and around and around.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Pours some water out of a water skin into a bowl, splashing his face a bit.
Goes and pulls out this small glass vial.
-ASHLEY-
Would you like some coffee?
-MATT-
Puts some moisturizer on his face.
-LAURA-
Oh wow.
-MATT-
There's a whole morning routine that he's going through.
-ASHLEY-
Get it!
-LAURA-
I didn't realize we'd be walking into your actual bedroom, I'm very sorry.
-MATT-
"Oh, this is not my actual bedroom.
I keep my supplies with me no matter where I am traveling, because you never know where you might be, and nothing's worse than being in unfamiliar and less comfortable situations without your moisturizer."
-LIAM-
How is Yash's skin generally?
-MATT-
Oh, it's glowing.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
He's got the routine.
-MATT-
Even in this low light, it's just a beautiful warm shade.
It's smooth, pores are kept well.
-LIAM-
Can't see them.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Would you like some coffee or something?
-MATT-
"If you are making coffee, but of course, please!"
-ASHLEY-
Well, is there someone I can ask? (laughter)
-MATT-
"Could you make us some coffee?" And the hooded figure looks back--
-ASHLEY-
And probably enough for all of us would be great.
-MATT-
Walks over and starts setting up.
(laughter)
You can see there's a little iron stove in the corner with a tube that looks like it exits, or it's built into and exits out of the chamber from above.
He sets a small fire and begins boiling some water.
So Yash turns (yawning), grabs a chair, scoots it around and sits on it with it facing the opposite direction, leaning over it.
"All right, so you're back so soon? You're not dead.
So I assume that Dugger has not quite done to you what he did to your friend, which is good."
-MARISHA-
He's dead.
-TALIESIN-
Dugger's dead.
-LAURA-
We've done the Dugger.
-MATT-
"Really?"
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Well, very well done.
That is-- I'm not going to say that I didn't expect a different outcome, but congratulations."
-TALIESIN-
We're shocked as anybody, believe me.
The brumestone, on the other hand, was not found.
-MATT-
"I have no idea what Dugger was doing with brumestone, personally."
-TALIESIN-
It seems like a dangerous thing to have running around the city, that's all.
-MATT-
"It's dangerous, but it's also worth a lot of money on black markets for people who want to, you know, depending on what its uses are.
That is a very controlled element.
I assume that it's probably looked for, sought after, is the Common phrase for it, by probably arcanists and engineers.
You know, it has a lot of uses, I don't often hear people clamoring for it, because to try and usher it away from the Alsfarin Union and any of the other individuals that control sources of it, is a very, very dangerous thing."
-TALIESIN-
He was fucking crazy.
-LAURA-
You said he was going back and forth between this and the Smolder Spire?
-MATT-
"The handful of times that he was traveling beyond his house, yes."
-LAURA-
I wonder if that's a lead for where to?
-SAM-
Did you know where?
-MATT-
"I'd have to ask around.
I wasn't paying particular attention to him.
We just kept an eye on him, but I can certainly inquire."
-TALIESIN-
The weird thing I keep thinking about is I thought at first that he just wanted the brumestone for some fucking crazy-eyed reason, was doing some sort of crazy fucking shit, because he was all fucked up.
But since it wasn't there--
-MARISHA-
It makes me so happy.
-TALIESIN-
-- what was he doing with all that fucking money?
-LAURA-
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Glad you're fucking watching.
(laughter)
-SAM-
He had a bunch of money?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, if he was getting rid of it, he must've been getting something out of it.
If he was getting something out of it, why? Because clearly he wasn't spending that money.
That place was a shithole.
-MARISHA-
Well, that place also seemed to be a cover for where he was actually--
-TALIESIN-
So is there a place that isn't a shithole, or is there--?
-MARISHA-
It seems like he's living underground.
-LIAM-
He seemed very comfortable in shitholes, I don't think--
-MATT-
"You think he's working for someone else? Do you think? No, see, we were looking for that.
We were thinking if he leaves us and then goes ahead and joins the Syndicate, then we have to fucking take him out.
But no, things didn't seem that way.
But do you think-- is he doing this for the Syndicate?"
-LAURA-
No idea.
-MARISHA-
He barely seemed human anymore.
-LAURA-
Yeah, oh my gosh! When he came out, when we saw him, he was a lump of jelly.
-LIAM-
He was like a dollop of honey falling out of a hole.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, he was in a hole and he was working his way through it.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
And then he came out and all of a sudden he was him again.
I know, I know what that sounds like.
-TALIESIN-
Like a honey dispenser.
-LAURA-
But it's the truth.
God, that is what--
-ROBBIE-
I think what we're saying is whatever we witnessed went beyond the normal realm of petty crime and smuggling.
It was something deeper, something worse.
-MATT-
"That is certainly-- (chuckles).
That's the stuff of nightmares, what you're saying there.
I'm going to scrub my brain from that mental image.
And I'm sorry you had to see that."
-TALIESIN-
Does it connect to the dancing furniture?
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
I'm sorry, I just have to keep mentioning that, because it's still fucking--
-MATT-
"What dancing furniture now?"
-TALIESIN-
We got attacked by a dining set.
There was a carpet and a table.
-LIAM-
Carpet and furniture exploded in a public square?
-MATT-
"All right, great, good for you."
-TALIESIN-
Just throwing that out there, I don't know.
It's been a weird week.
-LIAM-
Well, we've done a bit of a favor for you, whether you asked for it or not.
I think one thing we're hoping for here is that we're in a little bit better standing?
-MATT-
"Yeah, no, we'll stop following you, we're good."
-LAURA-
Thanks.
-SAM-
You were following us?
-MATT-
"Of course."
-SAM-
Did you all notice?
-TALIESIN-
I figured, but I didn't notice.
-SAM-
Wow, that's cool.
-MATT-
"And you have been very honest.
You have corroborated upfront exactly where we saw you go."
-MARISHA-
Are we easy to follow?
-MATT-
"Extremely."
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-MATT-
"You do not cut a low profile at all."
-MARISHA-
Oh my goodness!
-SAM-
We'll work on that.
-MARISHA-
We should.
-LIAM-
We barely even try.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's true.
-MATT-
"Yeah, we lost track at certain points, so when you put your mind to it, you can disappear, but you do not put your mind to it often."
-MARISHA-
That is true, yes.
-LAURA-
Our collateral?
-MATT-
"Nothing will come of your collateral, unless you do something to fuck us over."
-LAURA-
All right, that's what I figured.
-MATT-
"I have no interest in hunting down fathers. (laughs) Unless you fuck us over.
But until then, do not worry about it.
If we're friendly, we're friendly.
It is perfectly okay."
-LIAM-
Yeah, rather than be at odds.
-MATT-
"Precisely."
-LIAM-
I think we'd rather work in concert.
-MATT-
"Well, to be honest, there's a lot of factions that work in this city that have a lot more power and influence and are far more dangerous than whatever we do.
So people not affiliated with them, that we can stay friendly with, that works in our favor as much as it does yours."
-ROBBIE-
Do you have a relationship with Lord Eshteross?
-MATT-
"No, we have not had the pleasure of speaking with the--"
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-MATT-
"-- the inheritor of the Prudaj estate."
-MARISHA-
But you know who he is.
-MATT-
"It's hard not to know of him.
I mean, there's plenty of other rumors about that strange old coot."
-MARISHA-
Ooh!
-ASHLEY-
He's great! Actually, that's who I was talking about the last time, but I was very not specific.
-LIAM-
Yeah, he knows about you.
-MATT-
"He's hard pressed to not know about us, we leave a bit of a trail."
-MARISHA-
What type of rumors?
-MATT-
"There was some people that say, perhaps." (laughter)
"Some folks, at least, have a reason to believe that maybe he actually killed his previous employer, Prudaj."
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's what our landlady was thinking, too.
I feel like she had the inclination.
-MARISHA-
That's right, that's right, she did mention.
-MATT-
"Others believe that the reason nobody ever sees him is because he hides a dark secret.
He never leaves, he never goes into the public eye.
He stays in his house and just sends out other sentinels, and mercenaries, and hired hands to do his bidding, to do his work."
-TALIESIN-
That's us, yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Oh, so you are one of these contracted individuals?"
-TALIESIN-
I work for a lot of people.
-SAM-
We don't have a contract presently, but we've met the gentlemen.
-LAURA-
No, we don't.
We're trying to come up with a group name.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
Do you have any suggestions?
-MATT-
"None that you would enjoy."
-MARISHA-
Okay, well, a little exercise.
What is the first word that pops into your head when you look at us?
-TALIESIN-
Nope, nope.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's a good one.
-MATT-
"Trouble." (gasping)
"But!"
-MARISHA-
Maybe we can work with that!
-LAURA-
What if we just The Trouble? The Troubles? The Trouble Clefs?
-TALIESIN-
The Trouble Finders?
-SAM-
That's a good a capella group!
-ROBBIE-
I like that a lot!
-MARISHA-
That's sounds like every glee club name.
-MATT-
"Please do not do that.
I would be embarrassed by association." (laughter) "Some other people think maybe he's a vampire or some sort of creature that absconds from the light, because he stays away from it."
-LAURA-
I wonder if he is a vampire? You know, we never--
-MARISHA-
He could be!
-ROBBIE-
Would you be able to sense that?
-SAM-
Oh, yeah, what's your take?
-LAURA-
What do you think?
-SAM-
What the fuck is up with that?
-MATT-
"I think he's just a creepy, lonely old man with a lot of money, but who knows? Except for, unless you do, because you work for him, which by the way, what can you spill?"
Seems to have a better opinion of you than you do of him.
-MARISHA-
He seemed nice.
-MATT-
"I don't have a negative opinion.
I'm just curious."
-TALIESIN-
Paranoid.
-ASHLEY-
I know something about him that you probably don't know.
-MATT-
"Do tell, strange horned lady."
-ASHLEY-
Can you give me something for it?
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Guidance! No.
-LAURA-
No!
-ALL-
Aw!
-ASHLEY-
I rolled a two.
-MATT-
Oh. (laughs) You guys can't roll! Spent it all on Rollies.
-ASHLEY-
All I was going to say was--
-LIAM-
Spending high rolls on Rollies.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
A-Rollies! That wasn't it.
(laughter) I can't do impressions.
Hey, this is my Christopher Walken! (laughter)
-MATT-
Oh no!
-ASHLEY-
Rollies!
-LIAM-
Oh boy.
-MARISHA-
What do you actually sound like, though?
-MATT-
That's your backup character right there.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
He is an amazing baker is what I was going to say.
-MATT-
"Really?"
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
We actually can confirm that.
-MATT-
"We have to have some sort of competition with our very own Shadow Baker, Ephred, there one day."
-ALL-
Ooh!
-LAURA-
Oh, I never ate that damned thing he gave me!
-SAM-
The purple?
-LAURA-
I paid for it.
-SAM-
The purple pastry?
-LAURA-
Do you think it's stale by now?
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
It's probably fine.
-LAURA-
I reach in my bag.
-MATT-
It's a little stale.
-LAURA-
Fuck!
-LIAM-
That was quick.
-LAURA-
It's not wrapped in plastic or anything.
-LIAM-
Let me see it.
-TALIESIN-
If we see the--
-LAURA-
You want to try it?
-TALIESIN-
If we see the Shadow Baker again, then we'll get some more.
-MATT-
It's still tasty, it's just a little harder.
-LIAM-
That's fine.
-LAURA-
I'll take a bite.
-LIAM-
You can have it, Orym.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck me, goddamn it.
-LIAM-
It's half the size of my head.
-MATT-
"But good to know that! He's an unexpected purveyor of baked goods.
That is interesting information, thank you."
-LAURA-
Oh, did you give something valuable away?
-ASHLEY-
I just, I told him that he is an excellent baker, so I gave him some pretty great information.
-LAURA-
Anyway, if you'd like us to set up a meeting or something, just let us know.
-MATT-
"Is he interested in meeting?"
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
"Why does a strange recluse like him have any business with us for?"
-LAURA-
He certainly wouldn't tell us.
-SAM-
I think he-- I get the impression that he wants to do good in this city and he thinks that you also do.
-MATT-
"You think anyone who lives a life of inherited money wants to do good? Well."
-SAM-
I don't know, Dorian? (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Wow, short guy, low blows.
(laughter)
-MATT-
You see the hooded figure in the back cross his arms, leans against the wall, staring right in your direction, Dorian.
-ROBBIE-
Not everyone with money is bad, just some.
-MATT-
"Many."
-TALIESIN-
Possibly this one.
-ROBBIE-
Hmm.
I do believe he does want to do good, but that's just my belief.
I could be wrong.
-MARISHA-
I look at the guy in the back who's eyeing up Dorian.
Is he being-- Is he like targeting him? Is he taking note?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-ROBBIE-
Didn't even clock that.
-MARISHA-
What is that, 11? 15.
-SAM-
Don't fuck me, Gil.
-MARISHA-
Don't fuck me, Gil.
15 total.
-MATT-
15?
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-SAM-
Whispers.
There's lots of whispers.
Our friends at Ghostfire Gaming-- (laughter)
-- have a new episodic subscription service called Fables.
-LIAM-
Wow, I feel like I just tuned into NPR.
(laughter)
-SAM-
And don't forget that NordVPN is the easiest way to hide your IP and physical location.
And...
also sticky notes.
-MARISHA-
I just look at him.
I don't know if he-- I cross in front of his vision and just my eyes go black and I just crack my head a little bit and I do Unsettling Presence to him.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-ROBBIE-
Jeez!
-MATT-
Okay!
-TALIESIN-
I'm so in for it.
-MATT-
The figure, you can see in their full body leather and studded leather armor, the light gray cloak and hood.
-MARISHA-
I just go--
-MATT-
He just rushes off to the other corner of the room and just sits down and watches quietly from a distance, almost seems to-- The somewhat broad, intimidating form that they cut within the chamber is diminished into a child in timeout.
"Well, I am not against having a conversation with your wealthy patron.
We just have to have some assurances.
Understand that the person you speak of naturally is a little more aligned with those that we consistently work against." TALIESIN: Abso-fucking-lutely.
You see now, the jovial nature of Yash begins to become a little more of a cutting intensity.
"Money and influence in this city is a commodity that is passed around by a very small number of faceless members of the Quorum.
We continuously, continuously want to find out who they are and expose them.
And if it means taking every copper, silver, or gold to their name until they are forced to expose themselves to the public, we'll do it.
So if your friend, this Lord Eshteross, is keeping anything or anyone hidden that is in our sights, we will not hesitate to remove him from the equation.
But if you trust him, and he seems genuinely interested, and is willing to meet on our terms, I'll think about it."
-LIAM-
We do, in fact.
-TALIESIN-
I trust your terms more than I trust him, but I figured you know how to take care of yourself.
-LIAM-
You've got a direct line to him through us.
What assurances do you need?
-TALIESIN-
If we smell anything, we'll tell you.
-MATT-
"Let me talk with my compatriots.
I am but one of many, and I feel it would be untoward to my trusted associates to make a decision on this without their opinions placed against it.
So you're all staying in the Spire By Fire, yes?"
-TALIESIN-
At the moment.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Amongst other places."
-TALIESIN-
Amongst other places.
-LIAM-
It's a good place to start.
-MATT-
"Well, we'll find you when we have come to an accord, and are ready, if at all, to have such a conversation with your Lord."
-ASHLEY-
How does one become a part of this club?
-MATT-
"The club? (laughs)"
-ASHLEY-
Organization?
-MATT-
"No, no, I like it, I like it, we'll call it a club.
If you wish to join this club, you have to do some illegal things.
You have to go through some trials of trustbuilding.
You have to put your neck on the line for our interests and values and show that you are willing to give everything for what we are willing to give everything for.
And you would either wind up arrested and at the mercy of the Quorum, with no information to incriminate any of us, or show that you have some skill.
Show that you have the means of completing the things you promised, and be willing to give what is at your disposal to share amongst the rest of us, to share amongst the rest of them," and he gestures to the greater city around.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, well, that's where I draw the line.
I don't like sharing.
-MATT-
"Well, then, perhaps this is not meant to be a business element here.
But we believe in those who are capable, work for the greater sum to share amongst those that are not."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
"And those that have far too much and have not earned it with capability, we'll share it for them."
-ASHLEY-
That sounds like a good way to run a club.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Come talk to me when you're ready to join the club."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
"You'll never be ready to join the club, but if you do, let me know."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
"I am going to have some coffee.
Hey!" (snaps) Points over to the hooded figure in the corner, who's like (sighs)
Goes and begins to pour some coffee.
"Anyone else? You said you were wanting some?"
-LAURA-
I think we'll probably go.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
There's nothing pressing here, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
I mean, I'll just take a little to go in my cup?
-MATT-
"Sure."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Goes ahead and--
-SAM-
If you want, you can pour it inside my body--
-LIAM-
My body.
-SAM-
-- and I'll just have it like a thermos for later.
-LAURA-
Can you keep it at a good temperature?
-SAM-
I think I might be able to.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
It sounds right.
-ASHLEY-
It's like a liquid cooling system type of a situation.
-TALIESIN-
Liquid heating system.
-MATT-
I'm all for Sam, for Fresh Cut Grass, being Fearne's thermos for the rest of the campaign.
-SAM-
If you want, we can try it.
There's a single rod of plutonium inside.
-ASHLEY-
Let's give it a try.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
We can use him to smuggle shit.
-SAM-
Just pour some coffee.
-LAURA-
Did it make you feel uncomfortable, any of that stuff inside of you before?
-SAM-
Nope, nothing.
-MATT-
Okay, he takes this filtered bit of cloth and puts the grinds on it and pours the water over it, and, "You are nothing if not a very interesting way to start my day." Pours it through and sure enough, you hear (liquid dripping) it begin to fill up.
-LIAM-
♪ The best part of waking up ♪ ♪ Is Fresh Grass ♪ in your cup ♪
-MATT-
"I'll save that last bit for me.
You are a fascinating piece of machinery, my friend."
-SAM-
I agree! Well.
-ASHLEY-
How do you feel?
-SAM-
A little warmer.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Interesting.
-ASHLEY-
Is he okay?
-MATT-
"I don't know, are you okay?"
-SAM-
I think so.
-MATT-
"Perfect! All right.
Get the fuck out."
-SAM-
All right.
-LAURA-
Thank you so much!
-LIAM-
Well, he said that he's not the leader, but all those other guys just hang back the whole time.
-MARISHA-
I know.
-LIAM-
He really feels like a spokesman.
-MARISHA-
He's in denial.
-LAURA-
He feels like a leader.
-LIAM-
He should just own it.
-SAM-
Well, that wasn't a strikeout, but we don't have any actionable intel.
-ROBBIE-
We made the connection.
-SAM-
I wonder what note Ashley's writing down now.
-ASHLEY-
"F.C.G.
is also a thermos."
-SAM-
Okay! (laughter) (laughter) Good to note.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Trouble!
-TALIESIN-
I'm not against it.
-MARISHA-
What if we can be The Troubells?
-LAURA-
Oh no, Troubells?
-TALIESIN-
That sounds-- I'm trying to find the word.
That sounds like an a capella group.
-LAURA-
It does.
-MARISHA-
It's just like the Trouble Clefs.
Goddamn it.
-ASHLEY-
I do like that the "bell" be in it somewhere.
-LAURA-
I do, too! I think Bertrand got us all together, we should honor him.
-ASHLEY-
I do, too.
I do, too.
-TALIESIN-
Are we back out on the street?
-MATT-
We'll say you guys make your path through the Root Trader, back into the Elder's Post, which is still in the process of assembling itself for the day's business.
But the city is yours.
(laughter)
-SAM-
So--
-TALIESIN-
Do we see a baker?
-MATT-
Would you like to make a perception check again?
-TALIESIN-
Yep, yep.
Ooh, 14.
-MATT-
14? You glance around a bit, and he is not present at this hour.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-SAM-
Well, do we go back to Eshteross now? Or is there anywhere else to check? I mean, well, we got nothing, we got no leads.
The trail's gone cold.
-LIAM-
That's true.
-MARISHA-
Orym, you said the person you were looking for, they were wreaking havoc, they stole something? Are you also trying to track something?
-LIAM-
No, did I say that?
-MARISHA-
I don't know, I'm trying to fill in the gaps.
-LIAM-
No, I'm looking for someone else who's worked for Lord Eshteross.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LIAM-
No, excuse me, I misspoke.
He knows a lot of, he hires a lot in town and knows a lot of, I don't know, what's the right word, mercenaries?
-TALIESIN-
That's a fine word.
-SAM-
So he may know this person?
-LIAM-
He claims to.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LAURA-
What was their name?
-LIAM-
Breshio.
-LAURA-
Breshio or Brushell?
-LIAM-
Oshad.
-LAURA-
Rashad.
-LIAM-
Breshio.
-SAM-
Brushad?
-MATT-
Oshad Breshio.
-MARISHA-
Oshad.
-SAM-
Seems like an anagram.
-LIAM-
Apparently, also known as The Anger.
-LAURA-
Well, that's a--
-SAM-
The Anger or The Amber?
-LIAM-
Anger.
-LAURA-
That's a very specific name.
-LIAM-
Sure is, yep.
-LAURA-
Is that anything we would have heard around town?
-MATT-
You can roll a history check, if you want to.
-TALIESIN-
I'm into it.
-SAM-
I will, just in case.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-SAM-
Cocked.
Why does it keep--
-TALIESIN-
18.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-MATT-
18.
Yeah, you haven't been here long enough, probably, to pick up on those who've been in the vicinity.
18? Oshad Breshio doesn't catch your ear at all, but The Anger you know of.
There are certain mercenaries, not unlike where Lord Eshteross seems to have claimed his past emanated from, that make a name for themselves.
The Anger you know of, because whenever certain bar brawls that get very violent tend to happen, people use a phrase that's occasionally muttered by those that were around, running these establishments 20, 30 years ago, that says, "Be careful, you'll rouse The Anger." This is a mercenary that was known to shut down any sort of bullshit that happened at public establishments and anybody that began to break public property, they would be taken outside and beat within an inch of their life.
-TALIESIN-
I would definitely know this fucking story.
-MATT-
Yeah, they were a known mercenary.
Goddamn it.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
I can see it in my mind's eye.
-MATT-
A very talented sellsword, who was quite traveled around Exandria, but originated out of elements of Ank'Harel and the surrounding sands before eventually moving from mercenary to actually becoming a hired personal bodyguard to one of the Mahaan houses here, and thus the legend of The Anger faded from view, because they were no longer the rough and tumble, coin-seeking sellsword, and were, now, got a real job.
And that was like 10 years ago.
-TALIESIN-
I relay this, much as Matt did, except with--
-ALL-
More fucks.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Shits, fucks, motherfuckers.
-SAM-
Many fucks given.
-TALIESIN-
Many fucks given.
-ROBBIE-
Sorry, and Orym's connection to this, that information would be new what Ashton knew, but Orym's connection to this, Fearne and I are already privy to, right?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
Correct.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, just double-checking.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know if that's helpful, but that's what I got.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I know all of that already.
-LIAM-
You know where to find him?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, how many houses are there?
-MATT-
Of Mahaan houses?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Well, there are a number that work on the actual council, but there are dozens of Mahaan houses.
There's like the lord families that run the city and the larger Oderan Wilds surrounding it.
-TALIESIN-
Somebody's got to know.
-MATT-
Some are scattered in other cities throughout, but the central ones here, there's a few, a couple of dozen.
-TALIESIN-
No one entirely disappears.
Somebody's got to know, there's somebody who owns a bar somewhere, or somebody who is a last hire.
-SAM-
But nothing concrete to start on.
-TALIESIN-
It's been a decade.
-LIAM-
Eshteross thinks maybe he can make an introduction.
-SAM-
Back to Eshteross then?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I mean, it's the next day, but I don't really know what else to do.
-ROBBIE-
We can tell him we made the connection.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That's true.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
I mean, he'd want to know, especially if the Corsairs are going to start digging into him, because we brought his name up.
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm, smart.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As you begin to piece together your plot to figure out your path in the city, who best to ask and who best to inquire their knowledge, experience, and perhaps direction to give you onto one of these various threads, we're going to take a break! Because we're at that time.
-LIAM-
Man, what a fun half!
-ROBBIE-
It's a mystery!
-LAURA-
It's mystery!
-TALIESIN-
Inside an enigma.
Wrapped in a riddle.
-MATT-
Indeed. Back here in a few minutes.
We'll see you guys here shortly.
(gentle music) We don't have the strength alone.
It's the truth.
If we try to storm the gates again, we will be killed.
By what though? How long has she been in the ditches? Just a week, she'll learn.
I could help.
You've never seen the gates of the sun.
I have, I know what lurks there.
But to explore the Astory in Acropolis beyond, it's a scholar's dream.
This is no dream.
It's not even a nightmare.
Nightmares end, our imprisonment in the ditches is eternal.
But if we can pass through the gates- Horrors unimaginable await beyond the gates.
But you have magic, weapons.
Together we could survive the necropolis, make it through to the surface, be free there.
Free? The sun itself is forsaken Astoria.
There is no freedom in the dark.
And what would you be willing to sacrifice to get to the surface? Would you give your blood for it, your friends, your soul? When you stand in the court of the blood drinkers, haunted by what you've seen, well, you would be a brave hero indeed if you still thought of saving anyone but yourself.
Well, I have to try.
Someone has to.
All of us here, you think we have not tried? Those whose bones hold up these very walls, you think they did not try? If you've given up, I will wait here for others.
There must be more like me.
(heart beats) I just hope they get here soon.
(gentle music) Hey critters, Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop.
Glorious.
Ooh, look at this.
Look at the details, ooh.
So comfy cozy.
You need this? You probably need this.
You're only like five clicks away from owning this, maybe more if you have a lot of windows open on your browser, I don't know your life.
Can you put donuts in this? Only one way to find out.
Style should never be a dump stat darling.
And hey, if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now.
(inspirational fantasy music) (whimsical music) (typewriter clicking) (whimsical music) (uplifting piano music) Hi critters, Sam Riegel here.
There are many relaxing properties to a Twitch subscription to Critical Role, so today I'm going to tell you all about them in soothing ASMR, which stands for autonomous subscription meditative reaction or something.

Listen, that's the sound of your blood pressure decreasing.
You also get access to all of our custom emotes.

Doesn't that sound nice? (squeaks) And speaking of chat, Twitch is the only place to join our live and professionally-moderated chat while watching Critical Role.
So snuggle up with some cocoa and let the calm flow through those fingers, critters.
I'm whispering from really far away.
And if you're an Amazon Prime member you get one free Twitch subscription to a channel of your choice through Prime Gaming, so why not use that tranquil little freebie on a Critical Role subscription? Just remember to resubscribe every month.
Am I doing this right? Or, oh, sorry.
Am I doing this right? You can also gift subscriptions to fellow critters.
So what are you waiting for, start spreading that sweet serenity with a Twitch subscription to Critical Role.
It's like a warm blanket.
Oh, oh hold on, hold on.
It's my proctologist, just give me a second, okay.
Hello, hello.
Oh hey doc, yeah, what's up? What do you mean more teeth? I thought you got rid of them all.
Well no, don't tell me to relax.
I'm the one with teeth up my-- (calm music) Subscribe.
(calm music)
And welcome back.
So as you all begin to travel amongst the surface streets of Jrusar, what is it that you want to do?
-LAURA-
Well--
-TALIESIN-
No, no, go ahead.
No, no, you go ahead.
You go ahead, you had a "well," which is much more than what I had.
-LAURA-
Oh, I was just going to say, I feel like if we're talking mercenaries and we're trying to get more information about The Anger, then--
-TALIESIN-
Shake my trees, sure.
Let's head to the Krook House, see who's around.
-LIAM-
That's really good of you.
-LAURA-
Well, what else are we going to do?
-LIAM-
Okay.
Thanks.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
Following Ashton's lead, you head back to one of the-- well, it is a new path for a lot of you, but it's one of the number of familiar paths into the Fownsee Hollow to the odd interior, social oubliette of the lightless hollow itself, climbing down the levels and layers and ladders until eventually you find the familiar exterior facade of the Krook House.
There at the brightly colored exterior and the door that awaits you, you enter into the chamber, the smell of burnt metal, like something that had been welded recently through arcane arc tool technology, or at least very, very heavily heated and electrically charged, that scent hits the air, but it feels like it's dissipated a bit.
And at the first glance, you don't see Milo anywhere, instead--
-TALIESIN-
Yep, here it comes.
-MATT-
(laughs) You see Anni Aughta, who's currently in the process of looking through a book and has a mostly-eaten sandwich in her left hand, and then she goes like--
-TALIESIN-
You can read?
-MATT-
"You can talk?"
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Ah, good morning.
-MATT-
"Morning."
-TALIESIN-
Anni, this is everybody.
Everybody, Anni.
I think you've already briefly met.
-MATT-
"Hey, don't take anything."
-ASHLEY-
Why were you looking at me when you said that?
-MATT-
"Because you look like the kind of person that would take something."
-ASHLEY-
How do you know that?
-MATT-
"Because it takes one to know one."
-LAURA-
(giggles)
-ASHLEY-
You're adorable.
-MATT-
"I'm not going to say what I was going to say back.
Welcome to the house, I guess."
-TALIESIN-
I've been running into some trouble.
You haven't heard any word about, I don't know, some brumestone running around or, and this is, I know, coming even more out of the middle of nowhere--
-MATT-
"I genuinely have no idea what brumestone even is, so probably not." (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Expensive.
What was the last thing you heard about The Anger? (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Wow.
-SAM-
Right to it.
-TALIESIN-
I don't fuck around.
-MATT-
"Like, The Anger, The Anger?"
-TALIESIN-
Like, The Anger, The Anger.
Do you know where they ended up?
-MATT-
I mean--
-TALIESIN-
Not to imply you're that old, but.
-MATT-
"Well, no, like, you know, they get reputations around here, but they were before my time.
That's, like, old guard."
-LAURA-
Do you know any old people?
-TALIESIN-
Effid. (laughs)
-LAURA-
I mean, Zhudanna's old.
-MARISHA-
I know, she's old and--
-MATT-
"No, he was-- I think he was hired by the Lumas twins."
-ROBBIE-
The Lumas twins?
-SAM-
We got a lead, we got a lead.
-MARISHA-
Lumas twins?
-SAM-
The Lunas or Lumas?
-MATT-
Lumas, L-U-M-A-S.
-TALIESIN-
What spire was that again, oh?
-MATT-
"Oh, that'll be the Lucent Spire.
That's where all them rich fucks live, but I mean, that's getting up into the upper echelon."
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I may have to see what we can do about that.
Fuck.
-MATT-
"You're not planning to go talk to them, are you?"
-TALIESIN-
Not personally, but--
-MATT-
"(laughs) Good fucking luck."
-TALIESIN-
We'll see.
They can be very persuasive.
-MATT-
"Okay, yeah, no, go for it.
Please, be my guest.
Go ahead and talk to Mahaan Lumas.
Wish you all the best luck."
-LAURA-
Is it hard to talk to the well-to-do families here?
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
I mean, I don't know where you come from if you want to talk to, you know, very, very rich people out of nowhere about things.
-SAM-
Well, we have a rich with us.
-MARISHA-
We do.
You all speak a similar language, right?
-ROBBIE-
Sort of.
They tend to isolate themselves from everyone.
I think the only people that rich people fear more than poor people, is other rich people.
-TALIESIN-
This is very, very useful.
-SAM-
But maybe you have some riches in common that you could bond over or something.
-ROBBIE-
I'd gladly try and--
-MARISHA-
If anything, honestly, you can just lead with saying that you are a lord and they'll probably respect you more.
-TALIESIN-
You do look good.
-MARISHA-
You do.
-TALIESIN-
You look, you look-- I don't even know how you maintain that level of cleanliness in here, because this is, by its very design, extremely filthy.
-ROBBIE-
Every night I have a-- anyway.
-MATT-
Anni, who's finished her sandwich was licking their fingers and just goes like--
-LIAM-
100 strokes.
-MATT-
Rubs it on the outside of the cloak.
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Charming.
I will gladly help in any way that I can.
-TALIESIN-
Did you get that gig, by the way?
-MATT-
"I haven't gone into full audition yet.
It's still about a week off."
-SAM-
You know what, Anni, it just occurred to me, as you rub your food on Dorian over here, you know, you were a little bit nervous or embarrassed to play for us before.
-MATT-
"I wasn't nervous, I wasn't embarrassed."
-SAM-
But if you wanted some guidance from an expert in the musical craft, well, we have one with us right now, who could possibly give you some criticism or advice or help on your budding audition.
-MATT-
"Oh, oh, you're a musician, are you?"
-ROBBIE-
(stuttering) I am by trade.
-SAM-
Not just any musician--
-MATT-
"Is that how you afford your fancy clothes?"
-ROBBIE-
I have made plenty of mondey-- money-- What is the word? (laughter) I am a bard for certain.
-MATT-
"Obviously, we've all heard of you.
Please tell me, what's your name?"
-ROBBIE-
My name is Dorian Storm.
(laughter) Surely you've heard, I've played The Gilded Goat, for certain, that was one a few months ago.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-ROBBIE-
Fuck.
(laughter)
Not real. Ooh.
-LIAM-
Come on.
-ROBBIE-
(high-pitched noise) 17.
-MATT-
You see Anni is looking at you real hard, waiting for you to fumble through this and goes like, "All right, well, what do you play?"
-ROBBIE-
I play the flute, the lute, anything that rhymes with flute or lute, I'm kidding.
I sing a little bit--
-SAM-
The boot.
-ROBBIE-
-- from time to time.
I can play a boot.
If you gave me one, I'd tap away at it.
-SAM-
If only I had feet.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
What are you auditioning for? Did you say audition, Ashton?
-LIAM-
That was the word.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah, that was kind of the word.
-SAM-
Not just any audition, this is the finest theater in all of the city.
It's called The Dreamscape Theater.
-MATT-
"It's kind of a shithole, but it is the finest shithole in the city."
-ROBBIE-
What is your act? I'm interested.
Is anyone else interested? Or is it just--
-SAM-
Of course, but we don't want put you-- maybe if you could just have a private--
-ROBBIE-
Oh, but you don't want to put <i>them</i> on the spot, but you want to put me on the spot?
-SAM-
Well, you're a fantastic performer, international renowned.
-MATT-
"Now, are you one of them rich boy prepared music types with a lot of rehearsal, or are you more of an improviser?"
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I can do it all.
-SAM-
Jam session? Jam session? Is a jam session about to happen?
-ASHLEY-
He can jam, I've seen it.
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh.
-ASHLEY-
I've seen it.
-MATT-
"I got jam." (laughter)
Goes and starts making a little sandwich.
-ROBBIE-
It's on my shirt.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"See if you can follow." Pulls out this nice fiddle that she had hidden underneath.
-LAURA-
Are you going to Guidance him?
-SAM-
Yeah, I'm going to cast Enhance Ability.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
Yay!
-ROBBIE-
This isn't about me.
You don't want two stresses.
-MATT-
"Oh, this is entirely about you, honey, I'm sorry.
You walk in here looking like that, saying that you're a well-traveled musician.
I can't lose an opportunity to take you down several pegs."
-ROBBIE-
Oh, you shit.
I'm going to pick my lute back out.
Is this a "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" scenario right now?
-MATT-
Yeah, it is!
-ASHLEY-
Yes, let's go!
-MARISHA-
Dueling violins!
-SAM-
Okay, I am going to go over to Dorian and just say: Well, no matter what happens, just keep it positive, and remember, you just don't rush the beat, all right.
I'll cast Enhance Ability: Eagle's Splendor, so you have advantage on all performance checks.
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
All right.
-MATT-
How does that look as you cast it upon him?
-SAM-
Oh boy. (laughs) Never cast this spell before.
-MATT-
I know that's why--
-SAM-
I don't know what to do.
-MATT-
First time with spells, that's standard.
-SAM-
Sure.
I'll just have you look straight into my eyes and my eyes will just sort of glow blue and shine a light into yours, lighting yours up blue for a second.
-ROBBIE-
That feels nice.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I will start to lay down the rhythm section of a funky little rural beat.
-MATT-
All right, all right.
-SAM-
Rural?
-MARISHA-
Rural beat.
-LAURA-
Right as he starts to play, I'm going to Prestidigitation and little lights are going to sparkle up around his head, and it's going to look like in lights it says, "Dorian Storm." (laughter, cheering)
-MATT-
If you could audibly hear an eyeroll out of Anni as the head goes to-- (laughter)
"This is the company you keep? Sure." As she's saying that to you, you can see that the back of her heel is starting to pick up on the beat instinctually.
She starts rolling into it a bit.
-LIAM-
Wait, wait, come here, there's something in your hair.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, thank you.
-LIAM-
As he bends down a blue flower blooms out of Orym's hand and is now tucked into Dorian's hair.
-SAM-
Everything.
We're throwing everything.
-MATT-
I had to kick the battle music in because here we are.
-LIAM-
Anni has to [inaudible] rushed.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
Oh no.
-MATT-
With that, as soon as you start laying down the beat, Anni starts hitting the fiddle and it's low string and pick up, pick up, matching your beat, but also taking what you're laying down and beginning to guide it and trying to overpower it a bit.
Make a performance check.
-SAM-
Come on, come on.
-LAURA-
With advantage.
-SAM-
With advantage, with advantage, with advantage.
(cheering)
-ROBBIE-
Oh, let's go! That'll be a natural 20.
-MATT-
Oh shit! (cheering)
Plus, plus?
-LIAM-
See if you can get two.
See if you can get two of them.
-MARISHA-
Just in case.
-ROBBIE-
Plus what?
-MATT-
Plus performance.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, plus my performance, 27.
-MATT-
Yeah, see.
(cheering)
-TALIESIN-
Roll again, roll again.
-LIAM-
I want to see you get two natural 20s.
-ROBBIE-
That would never happen.
(screaming) Holy shit!
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, it did! (cheering)
-ROBBIE-
Let's go!
-ASHLEY-
What?!
-MATT-
What the fuck?
-LIAM-
Yes! (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Magic! My friends!
-LAURA-
Are you serious?
-MATT-
What the fuck was that?!
-MARISHA-
I know, it's right there!
-MATT-
Take a picture of that shit! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Let me get my phone.
Hang on.
-ROBBIE-
♪ Do it, do it, do it. ♪ It's magical.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
You asshole.
-ROBBIE-
Now I feel blessed.
-MATT-
Fucking witch!
-MARISHA-
I'm going to drop it in the cast/production.
-LIAM-
Oh, it was like he had a mote.
-MATT-
As Anni leans in with a--
-LIAM-
Of possibility.
-MATT-
-- fairly fierce performance, how do you respond?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I could stop the rhythm section and just bust out a killer shredding solo, but I don't.
I don't.
-MATT-
Not time.
-ROBBIE-
I ease back, and I set up a solo for her.
-MATT-
For her?
-ALL-
Ooh.
-MATT-
Now Anni, who was feeling confident, as you set up the solo, in that moment do you see the look in her eyes of panic as she wasn't expecting, she was pushing into you to try and get you off of your game, and you immediately reversed it on her.
In that brief moment, you can see there's a gap in her part.
For a few beats, the bow of her fiddle doesn't move.
Then she shakes and tries to catch up, and you threw her off tremendously on that bit.
Let's go and do another performance roll.
This is a progressive challenge.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, okay.
-LAURA-
You're like, "No!"
-MATT-
You still have advantage.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh, ooh.
-LAURA-
Advantage, advantage.
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm.
Okay, 22.
-MATT-
22, okay.
At this point, as Anni picks up and is now finding herself back in the beat, caught up, now she pushes forward into the solo, and with that, even though you're trying to meet her there, even just physical body language she begins to stand a bit from that sitting position where she was eating, she's now up and is beginning to domineer you just from her stature.
Even though she's effectively shorter than you from standing height, right now, there is a force of intention there.
While you both are fairly evenly matched, she's beginning to crest beyond.
She rolled pretty well, and is just starting to push over that and her solo is starting, and the rest of you are like, "Damn, this girl's got some skills."
-TALIESIN-
Yep, yep.
-LAURA-
This girl's got some skills.
-SAM-
Damn.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Goddamn it.
Let's go, this is the final roll.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, final roll, let's see what it is.
That would be a 25.
-LAURA-
Wait, did you advantage?
-LIAM-
Advantage.
-ROBBIE-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
It might be better.
-ROBBIE-
No, 25.
-MATT-
Okay.
As soon as her solo finishes, she immediately responds and throws a solo to you, hoping to catch you off guard.
Are you off guard?
-ROBBIE-
No.
No, it feels right.
It was a great solo on her part.
So I just answer right back, jump out of the rhythm section and blast out a little high-pitched solo on a lute.
♪ Can you do that ♪ ♪ I don't even know ♪ (laughter)
-MATT-
Even if you couldn't, you're pulling it off.
-ROBBIE-
Oh sweet, let's go.
-MATT-
He's doing it, Peter, he's doing it! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
He's doing it!
-MATT-
As you to carry it forward, you can see Anni starting to look anxious and nervous.
Looks back at you, continues to fiddle faster and faster and is meeting that point before (ping).
(gasping)
Natural one her part.
-ALL-
Oh no!
-MATT-
She goes "Fuck! Shit!" and stands up and storms off.
"Goddamn--"
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
(grunting, panting) "All right, you're good.
He's good, he's good."
-TALIESIN-
He's all right.
-MATT-
"Not better than me."
-LAURA-
Anni, are you okay? (laughter)
-SAM-
Are you okay, Anni?
-ASHLEY-
Could you tell us?
-MARISHA-
Are you okay, Anni?
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
Are you okay, Anni?
-TALIESIN-
No.
-MATT-
Now Anni Aughta storms out.
(laughter)
Slams the door behind.
Opens the door back, Anni goes like, "Someone dropped something for you in your room."
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
And slams it again.
-TALIESIN-
Hopefully it's not a death threat.
I'm going to go into my room.
-LAURA-
That was amazing!
-ROBBIE-
I didn't do anything; it was all you guys! It was the stage work, it filled me with confidence.
-LAURA-
You were great.
-ROBBIE-
What was that thing you did?
-SAM-
I just wanted you to, you know, grab the bull by the dick, you know.
-ROBBIE-
I did, I grabbed that-- I did.
-SAM-
Well, I mean, they're going to really know it if you grab them by the dick, right?
-ROBBIE-
That's right! Is that a saying?
-SAM-
That's a saying where I'm from.
-ROBBIE-
That's what I thought.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Well, thank you.
Thank you for the assist, yes.
We'll grab that dick together.
-TALIESIN-
Not hard to piss her off, but you did a really good job regardless.
-ROBBIE-
I wasn't trying to.
I wanted to--
-TALIESIN-
No, it's super easy to do, but wow.
-ROBBIE-
It was fun.
-TALIESIN-
She appreciated it.
-ROBBIE-
And she's very good.
-TALIESIN-
No, she's very good.
But damn! (laughs)
-MATT-
As you glance into your chamber.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It's easy to catch your eye because your room is a colorful disarray.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It's the nature of the Krook House in general.
It is intentional, deliberate, tattered edges, is the colorful aesthetic of the interior.
But a pristine wax sealed-- (gasping)
-- missive.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-MARISHA-
Prop, prop.
-ROBBIE-
It's a prop!
-LAURA-
Props, props.
-TALIESIN-
Is this ringing a bell?
-LIAM-
Loot drop.
-MATT-
The wax seal is familiar.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-LAURA-
What is it?
-ASHLEY-
It's so official.
-LAURA-
He's alone, he's alone.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, oh.
-LARUA-
Damn it.
-LIAM-
(pigeon cooing)
-SAM-
(pigeon cooing) Read the letter.
-LIAM-
Narrate your own dreams. (cooing) (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
(laughter)
(long sigh) Get to that in a second.
I'm going to put it in my pocket and come on in and--
-LAURA-
Everything okay?
-TALIESIN-
Maybe, we'll see.
Give me a minute.
-MARISHA-
He looks shook.
-LAURA-
Yeah, you look real--
-MARISHA-
Visibly shook.
-TALIESIN-
That was quite a performance.
-SAM-
It was!
-MARISHA-
It was. It truly was.
-TALIESIN-
Is Effid here? We should talk to Effid.
Is Effid around? Effid! Is Effid around? I'm going to yell loudly.
-MATT-
Effid, you know is not in too much of proximity to the Krook House, but with maybe a five-minute jaunt out of the space, you can go ahead and find your way to Effid's place.
-TALIESIN-
Yep, yep, yep.
While I figure this out.
-LAURA-
Is Effid in relation to whatever it is you got?
-TALIESIN-
Maybe, I don't know.
We'll find out.
-MATT-
All right, so you make your way over towards Effid's abode?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
As you all follow Ashton outside of the Krook House and climbing up about three tiers of the near opposite end of this darkly lit chamber, you see this mess of rope and net that resembles a hanging nest, an upside down hanging nest within this partially-collapsed cavern that goes back about 20 or so feet.
But the mouth of it and the roof of it is just this mess of heavily nailed in hanging pieces of frayed and rotted rope with exterior nets that have partially been broken apart in places, or have holes in them that have just been layered over in a fix where it creates this weirdly organic-looking interior from a distance, but you get up close and it just looks like a bunch of scavenged shit that's been nailed and pushed to the walls to create this nightmare jungle gym aesthetic to it.
You know this to be Effid's place.
-TALIESIN-
Effid! You awake, you there?
-MATT-
There's a brief pause.
Then you start seeing from the dark interior of the chamber there's one little glowing light in the far end that begins to shake, and then begin to approach in this swinging pattern towards you.
-MARISHA-
Oh my gosh, he's an angler fish.
(laughter)
-MATT-
You begin to see climbing upside down across the ceiling--
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
What?
-MATT-
-- a male eisfuura, older in his years with a deep brown feather pattern that drifts into a fading grayish yellow tint at the tips.
You see the wings that come off of his arms, You see the wings that come off of his arms, it looks like the feathers aren't coming out properly and the arms are jointed strangely, but he pulls himself out from underneath and dangling upside-down looking at all of you, his bright yellow eyes peering from the shadowed expanse.
You see the beak dark, almost black at the tip, open up a bit with this (inhales) inhale before it goes, (slow voice) "Hello.
Did you call for me, Ashton?"
-TALIESIN-
(sighs) Yes, yes, I had a couple of questions if you've got a second.
I'm working on some stuff to make some money.
-MATT-
"I'm very busy today, but I'll make it work for you."
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
Kind of scatters a bit close, and now is climbing down one side and you can see, it looks like their arms were broken at one point in the past and didn't quite heal correctly, but it doesn't slow them down, and they move across the space with a speed and a grace that is impressive.
They extend themselves out in the neck turns and you can see them as they're still staying focused towards Ashton is very much curious and looking over each of you.
-TALIESIN-
I'm sure Milo mentioned that I'm running with a new crew to try and pay the bills.
-MATT-
"I've heard a thing or two, and I've seen you come through."
-TALIESIN-
A couple of things we're trying to track.
Do you know where-- (snaps fingers) brumestone might've gone in this city? We're trying to track a little bit of that around.
-MATT-
"Plenty of it comes in and out, but it's all attached to ships."
-TALIESIN-
This would be in the nude, so to speak.
-MATT-
"Can't say I have.
It's dangerous to move."
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Why do you ask, cracked one?"
-TALIESIN-
We had to deal with somebody who was moving some around.
It's been a weird week.
I'm sure you heard about the fucking murderous table, carpet shit that went down.
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-TALIESIN-
Then had to deal with this guy who was moving that shit around.
We're also trying to find The Anger from back in the day.
With all of this going the fuck on, one of these shows up in my room.
I don't suppose you saw who dropped this off?
-MATT-
"I did see a courier come through.
Wasn't dressed like the rest of us.
Looked like they were from money."
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that's what I thought, okay.
-MATT-
"Who's it from, if I can ask?"
-TALIESIN-
That costs more than you have.
-MATT-
"Well, you've asked a lot of questions.
May cost more than you have, so good day," and begins to clamber back into the cave, but the head that continues to watch all of you in turn.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, don't leave.
-MATT-
Kind of stops.
"Why?"
-ASHLEY-
You remind me so much of a friend of mine, Dr. Nesbitt.
-MATT-
"Who's this Nesbitt?"
-ASHLEY-
It's a friend of mine.
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit.
(clears throat)
-ASHLEY-
Oh, but we have to go.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Oh hello, I'm Fearne.
-MATT-
"Hello, Fearne.
I'm Effid the Fallen."
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
Don't let the name fool you, they'll fuck you up.
It's a whole thing.
I think he wants to know who this doctor is, if you feel like sharing.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, it's not a real doctor, it's just a bird that's a friend of mine and I named him Dr. Nesbitt.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Right.
Good day, Ashton."
-TALIESIN-
I'll just throw a little bag of 50 gold.
-MATT-
With immediate speed, catches it.
Shakes it and just listens, not even breaking eye contact from you, just-- "You're very kind, Ashton."
-TALIESIN-
Well, I'd like to keep on your good side.
-MATT-
"You're doing well for yourself, you know.
I'm proud of you." Tucks it into this little side satchel pouch, that's affixed around one of the shoulders.
-SAM-
Did you know anything about where The Anger is?
-MATT-
"I mean, worked for the twins before everything else turned to shit." Then begins to climb back into the shadows.
-TALIESIN-
What you get is what you get.
-MARISHA-
What does that mean?
-ASHLEY-
"Before everything went to shit?"
-LAURA-
What went to shit?
-TALIESIN-
Well, we have a lead.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
What did you get?
-TALIESIN-
This, at the moment, is nothing.
It may be something, I will let you know.
-LAURA-
Can we read it?
-SAM-
Rollies?
-ROBBIE-
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
What'd you roll?
-LAURA-
17.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, I did, too.
-LAURA-
(gasps) Literally every time! That's the third time we've rolled the same.
-MATT-
Any of you who's played this game knows this shit happens all the time.
-TALIESIN-
Compromise.
-LIAM-
Rollies is a mysterious and wondrous game.
-MATT-
(wheezing laughter)
-SAM-
Are you redacting things?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
(laughs) I love it!
-LAURA-
Ashton, you're redacting all of it.
-TALIESIN-
That's what you get for a tie.
Compromise, no one's happy.
-LAURA-
"I have an eight when you are ready."
-SAM-
An eight?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-SAM-
Like the number eight?
-TALIESIN-
I suppose so.
-LAURA-
Wow, you really did redact it.
I can't tell what that says.
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
-ASHLEY-
What if you hold it up?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Get it like that.
-SAM-
Don't, don't subvert his-- (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
It's a perfectly reasonable subversion.
Would not fight it.
I'll see if that pans out into anything, but that will require some private time.
That's not something I can bring people to.
-LAURA-
You usually don't bring people to private time?
-TALIESIN-
God, you made that sound weird, I'm so impressed.
This is good, there's certain things, we all've got--
-LAURA-
Sure.
-TALIESIN-
-- some private shit.
-LIAM-
Keep hearing about--
-LAURA-
The twins.
-LIAM-
The Lumas twins.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Now we have a question for our patron.
-LAURA-
That's true.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
We've got more information to bring to Lord Eshteross.
-TALIESIN-
We have a question to ask.
How do we get to meet the Lumas twins?
-LAURA-
Maybe he could set something up?
-TALIESIN-
Maybe he could.
-LAURA-
Rich people want to meet rich people, isn't that right?
-TALIESIN-
Or they're afraid of rich people?
-SAM-
It's the opposite, I think.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I think maybe it's a two-way thing, maybe? I don't know.
-ROBBIE-
It could be, but we're a big group.
A big diverse group, I'm not sure.
-LAURA-
Maybe Lord Eshteross can make it seem like we're a bunch of rich people, too.
-TALIESIN-
That would be perfect because then I can go do my thing while you do that because that ain't going to work over here.
-SAM-
He might already have an in.
He implied he did, but if he doesn't, we could bounce back to Vash, our friend Vash, the definitely-not-leader of the Hubatt Corsairs.
Yash.
-LAURA-
All right.
So head on up? All right, let's go.
-SAM-
To Eshteross?
-LIAM-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Okay.
Not too far, still in the Core Spire, you head to the familiar estate of Lord Eshteross.
There, Evelyn leads you in and he is currently, this early in the day, he's still finishing his delayed breakfast.
You get the sense that he eats slowly in the morning.
-TALIESIN-
Respect.
-MATT-
As Evelyn leads you into the--
-LAURA-
We're early risers.
-MARISHA-
I know.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, you guys went to bed comparatively early because you were beat to shit and exhausted.
Even though you drank, by the time you went to bed, it was like 10:00, 10:30, which is early for you guys.
-MARISHA-
That's true.
-LIAM-
Started day drinking, fell asleep at 7:00.
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
Those are the best days.
-TALIESIN-
Those really solid days.
-MATT-
But as you are led into the dining chamber, the familiar place where you had your celebratory dinner when you finished your first leg of your journey with the Lord, he is there in the process of-- He has his spectacles on and he's reading through some paper and as you begin to enter, he holds up a finger to all of you to hold on a second.
He closes it, puts it within a small case and sets it aside.
"Good morning, friends.
Might I-- How might I be of service to you?"
-LIAM-
Oh boy, a bunch of things, right?
-MARISHA-
It's been a busy morning.
Apparently, we're pretty productive.
-MATT-
"You are not exaggerating.
Very self-motivated, which is oddly rare for those in your line of work."
-LIAM-
Well, first, we made second contact with the Corsairs and it seems like there is some tentative interest in making your acquaintance.
-ROBBIE-
We put in a good word for you.
-LAURA-
Yeah, if that's all right.
-MATT-
"Hmm.
How eager were they, if I might ask?"
-LIAM-
They seemed a little unsure.
-LAURA-
Less eager to meet someone of your stature? Of your station?
-TALIESIN-
Standing?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
They don't like people with money and you have it.
So, really, that's--
-MATT-
"That is-- That is assuring.
If they were too eager, that would spell ill intent, based on the dynamics in play.
Very well.
Do you have a place where such a request--"
-MARISHA-
They said it had to be on their terms.
-LAURA-
That they would get back to us.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-MATT-
"Very well.
When you do hear from them, please do come to me.
But I appreciate you making the contact and I do hope it comes to some net positive."
-MARISHA-
They also said that they heard that you killed Madam Prudaj.
-SAM-
Among other rumors that they did not know were true.
-MATT-
You see his face harden as he looks towards you.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
Struck a nerve, that one?
-MATT-
"Madam Prudaj was an honorable, good-hearted woman.
I spent the majority of my adult life protecting her.
I would never, ever have harmed her."
-TALIESIN-
Is no one else going to--?
-LIAM-
I don't need to roll.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, no.
Yeah, feels genuine as fuck.
-TALIESIN-
Insight check.
-LIAM-
I rang the top bell on day one.
-MATT-
Insight check.
-TALIESIN-
Cocked.
Ooh.
18.
-MATT-
18.
-SAM-
Oh, a little mini whisper.
Brought to you by...
-MARISHA-
♪ Mini whisper ♪
-SAM-
Koozies.
Please don't sue us, Koozies.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
The little one, I love it so much.
-ROBBIE-
How can you hold that? It hurts my hand just to hold that.
-SAM-
Maybe if you had one of our drink holders, if it would be nice and soft.
-ROBBIE-
Some sort of cozy of some sort?
-SAM-
Yeah, like a cozy, soft Critical Role--
-MATT-
(clears throat)
-SAM-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
I'll be sure to get one.
They're at store dot-- shop.critrole.
Not store.
-MARISHA-
Nope.
-TALIESIN-
Other than vague rumors, we do have some other things we could use some help with.
The Lumas twins, do you know them? Do you have an opinion?
-MATT-
He goes and grabs the case that he was currently reading from when you arrived.
"Well, I had told your compatriot here, Orym, that I would look into making an arrangement if I could, with Oshad.
Unfortunately, while I can make the arrangement, Oshad is not in a place to meet at the moment.
He is still recovering."
-LAURA-
Recovering from what?
-MATT-
"Oshad had been working as the bodyguard to the Lumas twins for quite some time.
But not more than a handful of weeks back, there was an incursion at the Mahaan Lumas in which the twins were killed--"
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-MATT-
"-- by an assailant or assailants.
Oshad was heavily wounded and is currently still recovering."
-LIAM-
I had some idea of this, but it's been some time.
They must've been grievous, these wounds.
-MATT-
He pulls out the paper and looks at it, and "It seems to be grievous, but treatable, and The Anger has been asleep for a number of this recovery period.
While occasionally conscious, is not yet ready to make conversation with those who are immediate family.
But I will push back and I assume," and gives you a glance, "that this is not an entirely surprising reveal."
-LIAM-
No, and we don't need to press.
Let them take all the time they need.
I'm not going anywhere.
-MATT-
"I will let them know that it is perhaps related to him."
-LIAM-
That would be deeply appreciated.
-MATT-
"Perhaps that would expedite their interest as well as Oshad's next time he is of conscious mind."
-SAM-
You know who might've wanted to harm the Lumas twins?
-MATT-
"There are many individuals from many places that have conflicts with a number of the Mahaan houses.
I am removed from a lot of those politics, specifically.
-LAURA-
Were the Lumas twins good people?
-MATT-
"I did not know them personally but they were known to be-- at least how I assume-- they were not involved in anything terribly dire.
They were curious, if anything.
Interests in those of the geological and scientific pursuits, if anything."
-LAURA-
Brumestone.
-TALIESIN-
Did anyone see what happened?
-MATT-
"I do not know the specifics.
You would have to inquire with the house or at least, whoever is responsible for keeping its orders functional while the heads of the house have been slain."
-ASHLEY-
Do you have any more information on the nature of these attacks, what happened?
-MATT-
"I only have what has been rumored and said but what I have been able to eke out is that there was an attack within the house and their hired protection, guards, if you will, did not see or notice the entry.
That is all I know."
-LAURA-
It's one of those damn holes, it could have been a hole again.
-SAM-
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Do you have holes in your house?
-MATT-
"Explain."
-LAURA-
Leading to the shade creepers?
-MATT-
"Right, I greatly do not think so.
I have not noticed any and then upon you informing me of these strange creatures' recent maneuvers throughout the infrastructure of the city, I have done a thorough inspection and have found nothing of the sort."
-ROBBIE-
After an attack like this, would the groundskeepers or curators check the house for such a thing as well?
-MATT-
"I imagine they would.
Looking for any sort of unseen entry, means of sneaking within the premises, beneath the nose of their very bodyguard.
For someone or someones to evade the hound-like nose of The Anger speaks of skilled incursion.
That is worrying enough."
-ROBBIE-
That doesn't sound like a three-foot hole in the wall to me.
-SAM-
Well, shit.
-LIAM-
I think in the meantime, we're content to wait on their recovery.
We're doing well together and in the meantime, if there's anything that we can do to help you in your interests here in the city, I don't think I'm speaking out of turn; we'd be happy to help.
-MATT-
"I appreciate that.
Well." He thinks to himself for a moment.
"Barring this conversation with the Corsairs coming underway whenever they reach out, at least keep an eye and ear open for their intent to communicate, since you are indeed the bridge between myself and them.
Otherwise, there has been a series of mysterious disappearances surrounding the Dreamscape Theater as of late."
-LAURA-
Ah. Cool.
-MARISHA-
Beware of the theater.
-MATT-
"Patrons--"
-LIAM-
It destroys the best of us.
-MATT-
"Patrons numbering no more than four over the past six months have vanished, at least those that have been reported to the Wilders."
-SAM-
During shows?
-MATT-
"I do not know the specifics.
You will need to speak with Stuvan Idrio to likely find out more about the spot."
-LIAM-
Stuvan Idrio.
-LAURA-
Idrio? Idrio.
-LIAM-
Idrio.
-MATT-
"Idrio."
-TALIESIN-
The owner.
-MATT-
"The Wardens have been supposedly investigating this for a protracted period of time, but have, to no one's surprise, come up short."
-LAURA-
All right.
Is it hard to get tickets to theater?
-MATT-
"Not if you have the coin."
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
"That is the most immediate thing I can consider.
The long game, well, I'm still keeping a few threads out and about before I could even make use of your skills.
We'll talk at that time."
-ASHLEY-
Are you all right? You seem to have a bit of discomfort.
Digestion? Are you okay? Maybe I'm just reading your face wrong.
-MATT-
"I...
have not sat comfortably in my space for a good number of decades."
-ASHLEY-
Well, you need to get a more comfortable chair, then, maybe.
-MATT-
"Perhaps.
That was-- (sigh)."
-ASHLEY-
I understand what you're saying.
-MATT-
"Continue to work for me and maybe one day, you'll understand what it means to be ever looking over your shoulder."
-ASHLEY-
Hmm.
That doesn't sound very fun at all.
-MATT-
"No.
But doing the right thing is not always fun, is it?"
-ASHLEY-
That's true.
-MATT-
"Well."
-LAURA-
Do you think it would be possible to get that letter of recommendation for the Starlight Conservatory?
-MATT-
"Right.
Yes, I can begin to draft that immediately."
-LAURA-
Thank you.
-MATT-
"My apologies for the delay."
-LAURA-
No, we never signed the contract.
-MATT-
"The contract would make it more officious, but it is not necessary.
I can put the paperwork together, officiate it, and perhaps be able to usher it off for approval to the Conservatory."
-LAURA-
Is that something that goes straight to them, or something we carry into the Conservatory?
-MATT-
"Let me deliver it without your specific involvement.
That may lend an air of..."
-MARISHA-
Credibility?
-MATT-
"Credibility to it."
-LAURA-
That's wonderful.
Thank you so much.
-MATT-
"Of course.
I will let you know if I hear anything."
-LIAM-
At your own time.
-MARISHA-
Quick question.
-MATT-
"Yes?"
-MARISHA-
Thought experiment, we're trying to workshop some things.
When you look at us as a group, the first word that pops into your mind.
Don't overthink it.
-MATT-
"Eclectic."
-MARISHA-
Eclectic.
That's difficult.
-LAURA-
The Eclectic--
-ROBBIE-
Electric Eclectic.
-LAURA-
Ooh.
-MATT-
"Did I answer incorrectly? You seem unhappy--"
-LIAM-
Eclectic Company
-MATT-
"-- with my response."
-SAM-
No, no, you did great.
There's no wrong answers here.
-MATT-
"I was not aware--"
-LIAM-
That's for my late 70s, early 80s kids.
-ASHLEY-
We're still trying to think of a name.
TALIESIN: The Eclectic Company?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, too on the nose.
-LAURA-
The Eclectic Bells.
-MATT-
"I apologize if I did not meet your expectations."
-MARISHA-
The Bell's--
-LAURA-
Troublesome--
-MARISHA-
Troubled--
-LAURA-
Treble--
-MATT-
"I am no good at branding, my apologies."
-TALIESIN-
Trebilectic Eclectica.
-LIAM-
Diplomatic immunity.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Well, thank you.
-TALIESIN-
That's not bad.
-SAM-
We'll leave you to your long breakfast.
Thank you as always.
-MATT-
"Of course, and if I may leave you with one final piece of advice, nothing too hard to remember or say."
-LAURA-
Oh, right.
Simple. So eclectric-- eclect-- no okay, we'll work on it.
-MATT-
"Do not-- I steered you in the wrong direction."
-SAM-
Before we go, because this breakfast spread looks fantastic, can I top you off?
-MATT-
You watch him go-- (laughter)
"It's still warm." (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
It's amazing.
-TALIESIN-
Hours.
-MATT-
"It is something.
Thank you, Fresh Cut Grass."
-SAM-
You're welcome.
-MATT-
"I'll enjoy this once you've left," and he moves it to the side of the table.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-SAM-
Shiny day to you.
-MARISHA-
Yep, we'll be back tomorrow!
-MATT-
(sighs) A long, labored sigh.
-SAM-
I feel like we're bouncing around like a pinball machine or something, right?
-TALIESIN-
We got options now.
-SAM-
Well, what are the options?
-MARISHA-
The Lumas twins are dead.
-SAM-
No option there.
-MARISHA-
Oshad is still unconscious.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, should we go to the theater?
-MARISHA-
What the fuck is up with that?
-SAM-
With what?
-TALIESIN-
Which part?
-MARISHA-
There was some sort of incursion?
-LAURA-
Yeah, what does The Anger have to do with you?
-MARISHA-
To what you went through? Was there some sort of incursion?
-SAM-
The Lord said that you would know, you would be familiar with this incursion, or?
-MARISHA-
Did that sound familiar?
-LAURA-
Did some of the Ashari--?
-SAM-
What the fuck is up with that? (laughter)
-MATT-
Man, fuck that.
-LIAM-
All right, not right here.
Where can we go?
-SAM-
We'll just walk and talk.
-LIAM-
No.
-LAURA-
Let's walk and talk to the theater.
-ASHLEY-
I think it might.
-LIAM-
I'm not going to answer your questions while we walk and talk.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's like espionage, secret.
And we are easily followed.
-TALIESIN-
We're also out of healing potions.
So if we want to, like, the Prism Emporium or some shit like that to pick up a couple things.
-MARISHA-
I have one.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, you guys have one.
-LAURA-
Is there anybody following us?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-ROBBIE-
Mm.
-LAURA-
One.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Nah!
-LAURA-
Nah! We're good, you guys, we're fine.
-LIAM-
15.
[ice clinking in liquid in metal mug]
-MATT-
15.
-LAURA-
(imitates ice clinking)
-ASHLEY-
(imitates ice clinking)
-MATT-
Nothing catches your eye as to being trailed or oddly keeping pace behind you, you feel comfortable.
-MARISHA-
We could--
-LIAM-
Crowded.
-MARISHA-
-- just all cram into Zhudanna's really quick and have a quick convo.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I mean, we're close by.
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Do you guys want to meet Zhudanna?
-LAURA-
Oh, she's the best.
-MARISHA-
She's so sweet.
-LAURA-
If she's awake.
-TALIESIN-
Very, very much so.
Yes, I do.
-MARISHA-
She'll make you some mittens, or socks, or scarves.
She knits.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
Sure, let's go.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
This I got to see.
-SAM-
To Zhudanna's.
-MATT-
All right, so you head to the Windowed Wall, Viduun-Devaar.
-TALIESIN-
Doing an NPC crawl.
[Inaudible] We'll do an NPC crawl.
-MATT-
You lead the rest of your troop towards the familiar abode that you've both been calling home for the past number of weeks that you've been staying here in the city.
As you approach, the rest of you see amongst-- you've been here now a handful of times, in the colorful, growing neighborhood of clustered and stacked buildings on different tiers and levels here at the Windowed Wall.
You come to this beautiful little homestead that's tucked into this cluster of the neighborhood.
You have to climb past a staircase to get to this front porch that you can see a lot of love has gone into it, but the paint is cracking just from age and sun.
But it has a beautiful view of the street below.
It's only about three tiers up, as opposed to the higher one where you had the previous day gone and done battle with a creepy, weird--
-LAURA-
Jelly man.
-MATT-
Jelly dwarf.
-LIAM-
Jell-ayy.
-ASHLEY-
Jelly roll.
-MATT-
But here you can see there's a window that leads inside.
It's warmly lit from the interior.
The door is closed, but it has this sweet, loved-in atmosphere to it, and as you step onto the porch, you can already tell coming through the open window, which it is open, and the gentle breeze is coming through as the the morning mist has already burned off and the day gets steadily warmer, there's a faint smell of cooked fruit, something that has been either fried or slowly heated and just has this gentle sweetness to it.
-MARISHA-
♪ Oh, Zhudanna? ♪
-MATT-
(high-pitched voice) "Hold on."
-LIAM-
Fried plantains.
-MATT-
You hear ping, ping, (clanging).
"Oh! Dang it."
-LAURA-
Oh, well, I just go in and make sure she's okay.
-MATT-
You look over and there's a pot on the ground and there's a few spilled, some sort of a roasted and steeped, plantain or banana-type fruit, as well as some other leaves and such that are spilled onto the ground and she's picking them up.
-LAURA-
No, no, I'll clean this up.
-MATT-
"No, I can handle it."
-LAURA-
No, you should go over, go meet the friends.
-MARISHA-
We have company, is that all right?
-MATT-
"That's wonderful."
-MARISHA-
All right.
A big group, brace yourself. Come in.
-MATT-
As you all walk in, you see this delightfully sweet smile on this elderly woman.
Darker, deep brown, tan, wrinkled skin from just life and sun and vibrancy.
Gray, nearly white hair entirely that is right now just let past the shoulders into this steadily spreading boisterous tangle of hair that goes to about her mid-back.
You guys are used to seeing her having it pinned back, but now it's just let down and it billows out behind and frames the shoulders.
Her wrists are thin from her very baggy what looks to be crocheted top that she has the shawl over her shoulders and this long skirt, and is just looking back and smiling with these bright but beady eyes, these beautiful brown irises that peer at each of you and looks at you with a kindness as you enter.
"Huh, well, it is an honor to have you in my home.
I fear that we're out of beds."
-LAURA-
Oh, no, no, no.
-MATT-
"But we have room on the floor and I can retrieve some--"
-MARISHA-
Oh, Zhudanna, no, you're so sweet.
We're just popping by for a moment.
-MATT-
"Oh! Well, I was making lunch.
Um."
-LAURA-
I'll help.
-MATT-
"Oh? Thank you so much.
This way," and she leads you over and you begin to gather.
You can see as you're helping her pick up stuff, she's starting to pull from the shelves other fruits that she was probably saving for the next day that she is now adding to this fruit stew kind of arrangement.
-LAURA-
Amazing.
-MATT-
But she being to prepare it, saying, "So, how'd you all become friends with the sweet, dear Laudna and Imogen?"
-TALIESIN-
Wow, oh.
-LAURA-
Hey, Zhudanna, I have a question for you.
-MATT-
"Yes, of course, my dear."
-LAURA-
When you look at us, what's the first word the pops into your head?
-MATT-
"(chuckles) Just the sweetest." (laughter) "Did you know they came to me in the middle of the night and helped get rid of a problem in my late husband's bedroom?"
-SAM-
They did, they told us about that.
That's quite remarkable.
-MATT-
"They are very sweet."
-ASHLEY-
Sweet.
-MARISHA-
Sweet.
-TALIESIN-
Very sweet.
-ASHLEY-
Very sweet.
-LAURA-
The Sweet Bell.
-TALIESIN-
So sweet.
-MARISHA-
Sweet Belles.
-ALL-
Sweet Belles.
-MARISHA-
Sweet Bell Peppers.
-ROBBIE-
Peppers, yeah.
There's a pepper.
-LIAM-
Sweet Eclectabells.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
The Troublesome--
-SAM-
Sweet Trouble.
-TALIESIN-
Sweet Troubles.
-ALL-
Sweet Trouble!
-MARISHA-
-- ing Little Bells.
-ROBBIE-
Sweet Trouble Eclectic.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I really want to get "bell" in there.
-TALIESIN-
Eclectic Sweet Trouble Bells.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh.
-LAURA-
I'll stop by the market and restock some of this, Zhudanna.
I'm sorry we're wiping you out right now.
-MATT-
"It's all right, but yeah, if you want to pick some things up, I'd really appreciate it."
-MARISHA-
Oh, we've been so negligent.
-LAURA-
I know, I know, I know.
-MARISHA-
We've been so busy, we're sorry.
-MATT-
"Oh, it's all right.
I have things to keep me busy as well, but it's not done yet." You see her reach over to pull up from this little comfy chair she keeps in the corner.
It's this bright red and orange and yellow knitted sweater that's partially done.
You could see it's only from the shoulders and sleeves down, it's only about there, and goes, "I just thought that you needed a bit more color."
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
Oh, goodness! Zhudanna, that's so sweet.
-MATT-
"It's wonderful."
-MARISHA-
It's a bit of a crop top, is it?
-MATT-
"It's not finished yet."
-MARISHA-
Oh, okay, perfect.
-MATT-
"But you also don't require as much yarn as others."
-MARISHA-
Oh, thank you.
-MATT-
"She's like a stick.
You should eat more, really."
-SAM-
She's not wrong.
-MATT-
"It talks!"
-SAM-
Oh, yeah.
-MATT-
"Ooh! Goodness me!"
-SAM-
Hi there.
-MATT-
"(squeals) Where did you find this little thing?"
-SAM-
We just sort of bumped into each other.
-MATT-
"Oh!"
-MARISHA-
Hey, Zhudanna.
-MATT-
"Yes?"
-MARISHA-
Just a question.
-MATT-
"Mm-hmm?"
-MARISHA-
Your husband.
-MATT-
"Right."
-MARISHA-
He worked with the Wilders.
-LAURA-
The Wardens.
-MARISHA-
The Wardens.
-MATT-
"Yes, a long time ago."
-MARISHA-
Do you ever remember him mentioning someone called The Anger?
-TALIESIN-
Oshad?
-MATT-
"Not particularly, no. Might have.
It was a long time ago."
-MARISHA-
Eh, she doesn't know.
It's predictable, yes.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Did you ever make pottery for any of the Mahaan families?
-MATT-
"There were a few times that I sold some of my finer works to a number of, I assumed were part of the Mahaan Houses.
They paid very well."
-LAURA-
Oh?
-MATT-
"Helped actually build out this home here at the time.
My husband was, you know, making consistent wages, but I was able to get us a nice place." (laughter)
-LAURA-
What was your mark, if we ever find ourselves in one of those homes? We'd be able to--
-MATT-
She walks over to one of the shelves over to the side of the kitchen, where you can see there's a lot of bowls and plates that she has there, and she takes one down, and you can see it's beautifully sculpted, green jade color clay that leads to this somewhat translucent top.
You're not quite sure what material mix she used for it to get this dense clay to this ombre translucence to the tip.
It's beautiful.
She goes, "This is one of my prized works that I would not sell." She turns it on the back, and on the bottom of it, you can see, pushed into the clay, there is the S-H-I-D-A-N-A.
Her name is gently carved into it.
-LAURA-
That's beautiful.
-MATT-
"Thank you."
-LAURA-
I've never seen a translucent piece of pottery before.
-MATT-
"Part of it involves multiple sources of materials.
The basic clay, and if you can find the right arcane enchanter, they can transmute elements of the mud and the clay to take different material attributes.
It's expensive, but it makes for some fine art pieces."
-LAURA-
Wow! How much would something like that have sold for?
-MATT-
"Oh, I would not sell that piece."
-LAURA-
No, no, no, I know, but similar ones.
-MATT-
"I would consider that one mostly priceless, but for others who'd attempted such things, they can run upwards of 200, 250 gold pieces for something like that."
-LAURA-
That's amazing!
-MATT-
"It costs quite a bit for the arcane, the skill set required to complete it.
But that is what you have to do when you want to raise your art form to another level, they say." (chuckles)
-ROBBIE-
This is a lot of pottery talk, isn't it? It's lovely, it's lovely!
-MARISHA-
It is!
-MATT-
"Ooh, like a bowl?"
-ASHLEY-
I'll take a bowl.
-MATT-
She goes ahead and begins to spoon out for each of you a-- It's boiled down into a syrupy-type texture to it.
It has very much, for a modern day context, a lot of the syrupy fruit salad you had as a kid in the little cups, like the little...
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I'm into that.
-LAURA-
Cocktail, is it?
-LIAM-
The juice, cocktail.
-MATT-
Yeah, the fruit cocktail.
-LAURA-
Fruit cocktail! That's what it is.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
But naturally created, not this terrifying abomination of factories.
-LAURA-
I loved fruit cocktail.
-MATT-
I loved it, too--
-ROBBIE-
No mini marshmallows
-MATT-
but that shit is--
-ROBBIE-
-- in it right?
-MATT-
-- not right.
-LAURA-
Oh my god, marshmallows.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, I'm having some of that.
-LAURA-
I'm going to go and slice up some crusty bread to give to everyone to cut through the syrupy.
-MATT-
Go for it, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Zhudanna, we have a little bit of business to talk about, but--
-MATT-
"Yes."
-MARISHA-
Just let me know if you are feeling left out.
-MATT-
"Oh, not at all."
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
This is delicious, by the way.
-LIAM-
What color was the shawl that she made for you?
-MATT-
"Thank you!"
-LAURA-
Orange, yellow, and red.
-MATT-
"If you want more, I have a bit of a secret, if you have the taste for it.
Do you like a bit of spice?"
-ASHLEY-
I love spice.
-TALIESIN-
I'll eat anything.
-MATT-
She reaches back from the spice rack, looking for the right one, and then pulls this lid and unscrews it, and puts a bit of this dense, brownish-red powder into it.
She goes, "Just mix that in a bit.
It's a bit of a--"
-LAURA-
Ooh, I want to try that.
-LIAM-
What do you add in there?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I've missed a home-cooked meal.
-MATT-
Goes ahead and puts it in there.
"It's my own special blend."
-LIAM-
Ah, okay.
-TALIESIN-
Do I have to roll something now that I've put it in my mouth?
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Is it like chili? Fruit chili?
-MATT-
It's cayenne.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, so cayenne! Fuck yeah!
-MATT-
It just adds a bit of really nice spice to the sweetness.
-TALIESIN-
Who doesn't spicy fruit?
-MATT-
Exactly, it makes it pop a bit, and tingles the tongue.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm into it.
-LAURA-
A bologna sandwich.
-ASHLEY-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
Orym, do you feel comfortable now telling us what you wanted to tell us?
-LAURA-
We can go into our bedroom if that makes you feel better?
-LIAM-
I think that's probably best.
-LAURA-
Okay, yeah.
There's quite a possibility that Zhudanna's actually a secret spy.
-ASHLEY-
Zhudanna, do you have a straw?
-LAURA-
You never know.
-LIAM-
I don't think she's--
-MATT-
"A what?"
-LIAM-
-- a secret spy.
-ASHLEY-
Do you have a straw? Like a wooden-- that's hollow.
-MATT-
"Oh, right.
Hold on." She goes in and takes a stirring stick that is hollow in the center and goes, "This could function."
-ASHLEY-
That will work, thank you so much.
-MATT-
"Okay, you're welcome."
-LAURA-
Just take it.
(laughter) (laughter)
-MATT-
I love Fearne so much! (laughter) I love it so much.
-ROBBIE-
Oh man.
-LIAM-
Jazz is Chaos.
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Jazz is chaos.
-SAM-
All right, tell us!
-LAURA-
All right, we're in the bedroom.
-MATT-
It is a very tight space.
This chamber is like--
-LAURA-
It's very tight.
-MATT-
It's 10-foot by eight-foot.
-LIAM-
You chose it!
-MATT-
With a singular bed in the center.
So when you guys are all in there, you're all like--
-LIAM-
Waited three days.
-ROBBIE-
Eating fruit soup.
-MATT-
Yep, yep, straight up.
-LAURA-
Squished up on the bed, eating fruit soup.
-MATT-
Epic, high fantasy adventure, right here! Retirement fruit soup in a tiny bedroom, let's go!
-TALIESIN-
In a grandma house, in a fucking grandma house.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
We're in a tiny bedroom in a grandma house.
-ASHLEY-
Doilies everywhere.
-LAURA-
But while we're here, we can show you the hole under the bed.
-MARISHA-
Oh, yeah, this is the hole.
-LAURA-
This is the hole!
-TALIESIN-
The famous hole that we've all been told about.
-LAURA-
Okay sorry, here's the hole.
Keep going, what's the deal?
-LIAM-
Oh, okay, so we're crammed in here.
We're all having fruit cocktail.
Everyone's got doilies.
There's lace everywhere plus pottery.
-MARISHA-
Dish, bish.
-LIAM-
All right, so Orym would look out the window at the city for--
-LAURA-
There's no window.
-LIAM-
There's nothing?!
-LAURA-
It's just a hidey hole of a bedroom.
-LIAM-
All right.
-LAURA-
You can look down into the hole, if you want.
That's the only thing.
-LIAM-
Give me a minute.
-TALIESIN-
Deep into the anus of the city--
-LIAM-
Leave me alone.
Then if there's no window--
-MARISHA-
Drama.
-LIAM-
-- then Orym looks--
-ASHLEY-
A fireplace mantel, maybe?
-MARISHA-
Yeah! (laughter)
-LIAM-
Looks at Dorian and Fearne for a second, and then to Imogen, and says: You probably would have caught this off of me eventually, anyway.
It's good.
You already know where we're from, where I'm from.
A number of years ago, an attack was made on the seat of power there.
What are you writing?
-LAURA-
Nothing.
-LIAM-
It was unique.
The attack came from out of nowhere and disappeared almost before it started.
A few of those assailants were...
dropped, and...
they evaporated, melted before our eyes.
That was years ago, left more questions than anything else.
That's as much as I knew about it for years.
Until recently.
This gets a little tricky.
A friend to the Ashari in Whitestone heard a rumor from a friend.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LIAM-
With me so far?
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh, friend, Whitestone.
-LIAM-
Who traveled here.
-MARISHA-
Heard rumor and traveled here, all right.
-LIAM-
Friend of Breshio's spoke with Breshio.
Whatever the attack Eshteross made reference to was similar.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
So you heard of this attack, came out here.
-LIAM-
More or less, I didn't hear anything.
This is above my--
-MARISHA-
Right.
-LIAM-
-- pay grade.
-LAURA-
So who sent you to find out?
-LIAM-
I was sent by the leader in my home, the Voice of the Tempest.
-LAURA-
So your leader was not one of the people that was killed in this attack?
-LIAM-
No, very few were.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay.
-LIAM-
And it was fast.
Anyway, word got back that something happened here may be similar.
I've already been afield for awhile and was called home.
Then I brought Fearne and Dorian with me, and they sent us here to sniff it out.
That's the whole story.
-LAURA-
The people that attacked your village, what were they after, do you know? Who did they target?
-LIAM-
Our leader.
-LAURA-
But they didn't succeed?
-LIAM-
No.
And there's some questions, some debate whether it was a legitimate attempt, or maybe a test run, but years have gone by since this happened.
I put it largely out of my mind.
Tried to, anyway.
And now, five, six years later, this rumor came back to my people, and we're just seeing it through.
-MARISHA-
Do you know anyone who died on that day?
-LIAM-
Absolutely.
-MARISHA-
Hmm, tragic.
-TALIESIN-
This was how many years ago?
-LIAM-
Six years ago.
-TALIESIN-
This happened in your town, in Ashari?
-LIAM-
Zephrah, yes.
-TALIESIN-
Wait.
Zephrah's the name of the town?
-LIAM-
It's a little more than a town, but yeah.
-TALIESIN-
So Ashari's not the name of the town?
-LIAM-
The Ashari are my people.
-TALIESIN-
The Ashari are the people who live in Zephrah?
-LIAM-
And other places.
-LAURA-
It seems like it should be Zephronians or Zephrians.
-TALIESIN-
I was just thinking that.
-ASHLEY-
I was thinking about that as well.
-TALIESIN-
That's really confusing.
-LIAM-
Are the people here Jrusarians?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Are they?
-TALIESIN-
Often.
I mean, if you're from here, yeah.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
If you live here long enough.
-LIAM-
I didn't found the civilization.
-SAM-
Maybe you should have.
-LIAM-
That'd be a trick.
-ASHLEY-
Could've fooled me.
-SAM-
If only you could go back in time, change things.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
That's a fool's errand, my friend.
-MATT-
Deep.
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay, so.
-SAM-
Okay, well, so these attacks may be related.
There's a someone out on the loose who wants to kill Ashari leaders as well as Jrusari leaders.
-ALL-
Ooh.
-SAM-
The Rhyming Bandits.
-MARISHA-
Rhyming Bandits.
-LAURA-
Good, the Evaporating Rhyming Bandits because they just poof out of thin air, or do they melt away, or do they turn to ash? I mean, Dugger turned to ash.
-LIAM-
I watched two people melt into nothing with nothing left behind.
-MARISHA-
Was it magic, or technology?
-LIAM-
Technology.
I believe it was arcane in nature.
-TALIESIN-
This sort of thing happen a lot there? Big magic fuck-ups?
-LIAM-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-SAM-
Well, thank you for telling us, but unfortunately, I don't know that that changes our trajectory very much, does it?
-LIAM-
No.
-MARISHA-
And you have no further information on the motives on why they attacked?
-SAM-
Does your leader owe a gambling debt to someone or--
-MARISHA-
Dabbling.
-LAURA-
Yeah, maybe she got in bad with someone.
-MARISHA-
Right.
-LIAM-
Not that I'm aware of.
-LAURA-
Does she have any ties to Jrusar?
-MARISHA-
Dabbling in the underworld.
-LIAM-
I mean, she is in communication with people all over the world, but again, this is above my pay grade.
-SAM-
Sure, sure.
-LIAM-
I'm a guard.
Part of her guard, but again, I don't...
And I-- Present tense, past tense, was part of her guard.
-SAM-
Well, if it's important to you, it's important to us.
So we'll just keep digging in.
-LIAM-
I appreciate it.
-LAURA-
How are you going to get word back? If you do figure it out, do you have to go all the way back to Zephrah?
-LIAM-
I haven't thought that far ahead.
I probably could find a way.
-LAURA-
To send word?
-LIAM-
To send word back, and if need be, I'll go back.
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-LAURA-
Well, then I hope it takes a while because I do like having y'all all around.
-ASHLEY-
Aw!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, it's not bad.
-SAM-
That's nice.
-TALIESIN-
So I feel like we've got some options.
-SAM-
Yeah, but to the theater again?
-TALIESIN-
Well, here's my feeling is we've put the word out.
Plenty of people now know what we're looking for.
So I figure that trouble's going to find us one way or another.
In the meantime, we have a lead, and we have a theater, and we have a reason to get--
-SAM-
Ermahgerd?
-TALIESIN-
We have a very easy, easy in to the theater.
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-LAURA-
You can audition!
-ASHLEY-
(gasps)
-ROBBIE-
What?
-SAM-
We can pose as your managers.
-ROBBIE-
(unhappily) Oh.
-MARISHA-
And your road crew.
-ROBBIE-
(unconvinced) Mm-hmm!
-SAM-
And you can audition to get in.
Or we could just ask the owner.
-TALIESIN-
Well, maybe if you get a show, you can get backstage,
-ROBBIE-
We could use your friend as well.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh, Anni, uh.
-LAURA-
Ooh, Anni.
-SAM-
Let's go scope it out, just see what this theater's like.
-LAURA-
Let's see if it's fancy, if we got to dress up for it or not.
-TALIESIN-
Worst case, I'm going to rustle a few more bushes of my own that I kind of have to do alone at some point.
See if I can pull anything out of thin air, but that's further down the line.
-ROBBIE-
Seems like we've got a lot of irons in the fire.
-TALIESIN-
Well, if you put them out there, something eventually, something will snap back.
I don't know if that metaphor worked.
-MARISHA-
No.
-SAM-
So should we get out of this old person's bedroom?
-LAURA-
Well, technically, it's our room.
Yeah, let's get out.
-TALIESIN-
Technically, you are the oldest, I think.
I actually don't know that.
At the moment, I'm assuming you're the oldest.
-MARISHA-
Well, I mean, he might be.
-LAURA-
Well, he's only two.
-TALIESIN-
They're two.
-MARISHA-
Oh, it's true.
-ROBBIE-
I wouldn't go making bets on it.
-LAURA-
Oh, how old are you, Dorian?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, well, 27.
-TALIESIN-
I'll make a bet on anything, I don't know.
-LAURA-
Insight check.
You're like 70 years old or something.
-MATT-
Make an insight check.
-TALIESIN-
Also, have an impressive skincare regimen.
-LAURA-
One.
-MATT-
(wheezes)
-SAM-
27.
-ROBBIE-
I am 27, 27.
-TALIESIN-
It's a Dremel with a polishing wheel.
-ASHLEY-
I'm 27. I'm 17.
I'm 17! (laughter)
-SAM-
All right, we're getting out of here.
-TALIESIN-
All right, let's go.
-MATT-
Where're you heading to?
-TALIESIN-
To see if there's tickets to the theater.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
On the way out, I'll just-- What's her name?
-SAM-
Zhudanna, thank you.
Thank you for your hospitality, and congratulations on a life well-lived, and hearts changed, and love spread.
You really did it.
-MATT-
"Oh, you're extremely sweet.
A little macabre." (laughter) "But I appreciate all of you coming.
I hope you enjoyed your food."
-TALIESIN-
Thank you for the fruit cup.
-MATT-
"Any time."
-TALIESIN-
Mm!
-LAURA-
On the way out, I'm just going to give Zhudanna 20 gold.
-MATT-
"Oh, oh, Imogen, this is far too much.
This is, please, I don't even know what to do with this."
-LAURA-
I'm going to tuck it away in her knitting supplies.
I'm going to leave.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
We'll bring back some produce.
-MATT-
"Thank you, potatoes!"
-MATT-
"If you don't mind."
-LAURA-
Writing it down, potatoes.
Are you almost out of eggs? Eggs, bread.
-MATT-
"Yes."
-LAURA-
Oh, I ate all the bread. Bread.
-MATT-
"Bread as well!"
-MARISHA-
Bread, potatoes.
-MATT-
"You're so kind, thank you."
-MARISHA-
I'll pick up more plantains as well.
-MATT-
"All right." (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
A little iffy on plantains, but okay.
-MARISHA-
We will mix it up.
We'll see what's in the market.
-MATT-
We can continue to role-play the shopping list, if you'd like.
-SAM-
Nope, let's not.
-MATT-
But (laughs).
-LAURA-
I-- (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I mean, that voice is entertaining, but--
-MATT-
I don't know where the fuck that came from.
-MARISHA-
So cute.
-ASHLEY-
I love her.
-LIAM-
I want a French toast with plantains.
-LAURA-
God, that sounds so good.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, so good.
-TALIESIN-
Anyway.
-MATT-
All right, so you are heading towards where? SAM and TALIESIN: The theater!
All right.
-LAURA-
(exaggerated) The theater.
-MATT-
Now, you know exactly where it is, though you've not been a patron of it in a long time, if at all.
-TALIESIN-
I go to a show on occasion.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I wrote down the shopping list.
-MATT-
But as Ashton brings you around, it's on the opposite side of the Core Spire where a majority of the main streets are here.
It sits in a space where there are other shops and a smaller thoroughfare than where the Spire by Fire, and the main street is, as it prefers to domineer over the space that it occupies.
You can see why, as you come around the corner.
Even in the midday, late afternoon time that you arrive, you can see amongst the other one to two-story buildings that you can see at a glance are either residential or smaller business-oriented.
Already, you can see the three-story, pagoda-esque display of this scalloped, multi-tiered roof that is covered in dangling magically-lit bobbles that just swing with the wind.
As they glow even bright enough that in the mid bright jungle daylight, they still can't help but catch your eye as you turn the corner and see the deep crimson, purple-trim set roof that sets this tiered rising structure.
There upon it, you can see all manner of posters that are placed upon each level.
You can see performers and dancers frozen in time.
As you look and focus, you watch, they're not frozen, they're gently moving.
Each of these is some sort of an arcane image that is placed upon the side that is capturing a moment in time that slowly passes.
You assume from either some past performance or some hopeful artistic endeavor, but it is a kinetic sculpture as much as it is a structure.
As you get closer, you can see in the lights, there are posters, there is a soft music that emanates from within, a massive double door that is gilded in gold around the edges.
It is extravagant.
It is, dare I say, gaudy, in comparison to everything else around it.
You see a neighborhood that consists of earth tones and muted colors, and in the middle of it is this screaming gem of a structure that's saying, "Come and look at me." This is the Dreamscape Theater.
So you can see, at this point in the afternoon, it looks like there isn't a performance happening, but there are people that are beginning to arrive, people that are entering, and you do see within the immediate entrance, there appears to be two pedestals and individuals that are having conversations or taking tickets.
You're unable to see from this distance, but there is a little bit of business going on within the interior.
-LAURA-
Should we just go see if we can talk to the owner?
-SAM-
Sure.
-LAURA-
Sure, I'll walk up to the person.
-SAM-
I mean, they might not want to talk about patrons getting kidnapped from their premises.
-LAURA-
But if we say-- Oh, we're not to say who we were sent by.
Are we ever allowed to say who we were sent by?
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-SAM-
We could!
-ROBBIE-
Or, we could see who's playing tonight.
-TALIESIN-
That was my thought.
-LAURA-
Yeah, sure.
-TALIESIN-
Get some tickets.
See a show, you know, for work.
-LIAM-
Maybe we could just start with rumors with other audience members.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
Gossip and scuttlebutt.
-TALIESIN-
Look at that.
-MARISHA-
And any employee loves to gossip.
-TALIESIN-
That, too.
-ROBBIE-
What do the other people look like that are coming in here? Are they dressed up, or are they dressed down, or is it normal?
-MATT-
At a quick glance, you could see it's an array, but the baseline is moderate to some that are a little more well-dressed for an evening out at a performance.
You do see wandering in the outskirts, a couple of what would be considered the lower-class folk of Jrusar, but some of them are looking hopeful, or others are just maybe waiting for other individuals they're meeting up with.
It's a wide spread here.
You get the sense that this isn't an exclusive space that only caters to the Mahaan Houses and the elites.
This is definitely a place that has a tiered structure to welcome anyone who has the gold to pay and to see the performances that can be found within.
-LIAM-
You know, if you volunteer as an usher, you can see it for free.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
Standing room only.
-LIAM-
No experience with that.
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-MATT-
Too real.
-LIAM-
Just a thing I heard.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Should I check on tickets?
-LAURA-
Yeah, let's see what's going on.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Is there a ticket booth?
Ticket window?
-MATT-
Not like a window at the exterior, this is not a classic here--
-ASHLEY-
Just asking a question.
-MATT-
But glancing inside, you can see there are two individuals that are dressed in similar attire.
That is long black, drapery-like robes that fall off the mantle and cover most of their material-- Like most of their form, it looks like it's a long dress that essentially obscures most of their body.
Beyond their hands, a little bit of gold trim around it that matches what you can see inside of the main antechamber that leads deeper into the theater.
In the actual main performance chamber, a similar black aesthetic with gold trim around it.
You can, at a glance, see there is a familiar uniformed connection between them.
You see, to the right of you, and engaged in conversation with probably a little more, you know, middle-class couple and a little bit of laughing, passing conversation.
A human woman, probably in her early forties, who is engaged there.
To the right, you see currently unattended as the individuals that we're speaking with move into the main theater proper, a halfling man in probably his late twenties or so is standing on a pedestal to match the height of the other individual.
But the cloak they're wearing, that robe aesthetic, moves past and beyond and puts them on a similar stature.
It's only the proportions of the shoulders and the arms and your familiarity with traveling with Orym for so long, that immediately lets free the idea that this is a halfling individual.
But you see him, he has a very, very well trimmed beard that is tight to his, you know, somewhat thin face and features.
His hair is definitely combed at a unique swish of an angle.
It gives it a thin artistic presentation of what would be considered the general aesthetics of the city around you.
And as you make eye contact with him, he glances over to you with arms open.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
Yes, hello.
Is this where you purchase tickets for the show?
-MATT-
"If you have not already purchased a ticket for the afternoon matinee performance, you may purchase them here, yes."
-ASHLEY-
Okay, how much are they?
-MATT-
"Uh, where do you wish to sit? There are three sections of which you can purchase seats.
Our available matinees are not quite as busy this day, but if you would like the front stage seating arrangement, that would run about 10 gold per seat.
If you'd prefer the middle region of it, about a gold per seat.
If you would like the challenged back seats, those will run you about two silvers each."
-SAM-
You might want to rethink their section names.
-LAURA-
Is there-- I know! (laughter)
Are there any seats, like box seats, that overlook the rest of the audience as well?
-MATT-
"There are, but I believe they are currently sold out for the matinee, my apologies."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Do you need any ushers? (laughter)
-MATT-
"No, I think we're fine, but thank you."
-MARISHA-
We volunteer, or okay.
-MATT-
"We're good, thank you."
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
What about for the evening performance?
-MATT-
"Oh, ushers for the evening performance?"
-LAURA-
No, the box seats.
-MATT-
"I'd have to look at the current sale schedule, but usually the evenings are busier than the matinees."
-LAURA-
Right.
-ASHLEY-
We can wait, while you look.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, are you sure they're sold out? I'm going to reach into my coin purse, and I'm going to pull out-- 10 platinum.
(gasping, oohs)
-LAURA-
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How much fucking money do you have? You have 10 fucking platinum?
-MATT-
All right, you pull out 10 platinum and he looks at you strangely, and then his eyes go wide.
"Oh, I'm sorry, there must've been a mistake.
Oh, there is indeed availability within the left box seating arrangements that, of course, are immediately at your disposal."
-ASHLEY-
Big mistake, huge.
-LAURA-
You work on commission?
-ROBBIE-
Thank you so much for your help.
I'm going to shake his hand with the money.
-LAURA-
You're going to give him-- You're giving him 10 platinum for that.
You're giving him 10-- okay.
-MATT-
"It is indeed my absolute pleasure.
And do not worry, we will handle and take care of everything that you and your compatriots would need for the evening."
-SAM-
Evening or afternoon? Did you get matinee or evening tickets?
-ROBBIE-
Right now.
-SAM-
Right now, matinee.
-ASHLEY-
Is there--
-MATT-
Yeah, we'll say-- Look at that, it's sunset.
(cheering) Early sunset.
-TALIESIN-
We had a very nice lunch.
-LIAM-
The night comes on fast here in Jrusar.
-MARISHA-
It's a jungle, you know, you're right on the equator.
-MATT-
It's the time of the year where the sun goes down earlier.
-TALIESIN-
It's like 4:00, what's happening? (laughter) It's a joke for the Americans.
-MATT-
Immediately claps, and looks-- (hisses) off to somebody you don't notice.
You see like two individuals behind a curtain within this main antechamber, look, and they wander off.
What were you going to say?
-ASHLEY-
Do you have auditions? How does that work?
-MATT-
"Not for the show tonight.
There is-- it is very much a set troupe performing."
-ASHLEY-
Who's playing?
-MATT-
"This is--"
-SAM-
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
Here we go.
-MATT-
"Kendra's Flying Lauders."
-MARISHA-
Kendra's Flying Lauders.
-LIAM-
What was that last word?
-MATT-
"Lauders."
-LIAM-
Lauders rhymes with otters?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
Oh, I wish it was otters.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Man, I'd pay money to see little otters fly.
Fuck.
Flying otters.
-LAURA-
Would you pay 10 platinum? Because we already did.
-LIAM-
For a flying otter, wouldn't you?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, fair.
-SAM-
Before you show us to our seats, we've heard tell that some of the patrons have--
-LAURA-
Just jumping in?
-SAM-
-- gone missing?
-MATT-
"I have not heard of such a thing.
That's so-- that's absurd.
The rumors that spread in this city by ill folk.
How are you talking? You--"
-SAM-
Oh, everybody talks.
-MATT-
"Terribly sorry, I believe your-- Your machine is malfunctioning."
-TALIESIN-
Insight check.
11.
-MATT-
11, you don't get much, but you get the sense this isn't a line more than they're like, what are you doing? We're in a public space here with people who are paying tickets to be here, what do you? No, of course that never happened.
You get a sense this is someone denying something, that maybe they're just like-- No.
-TALIESIN-
It's not like they were going to, yeah.
-SAM-
Okay, good to know.
-ASHLEY-
I really love your jacket.
-MARISHA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
"Thank you."
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to try to take the 10 platinum out of his pocket.
-MATT-
Make a sleight of hand, Fearne.
-ASHLEY-
This is dumb.
-MATT-
I love dumb.
-ASHLEY-
It's cocked.
-LAURA-
Goddamn it.
Oh god.
-ASHLEY-
Dirty 20.
-LAURA-
Oh, dirty 20, dirty 20.
-SAM-
Roll off.
-MATT-
As you lean in and grab the robe--
-ASHLEY-
What a lovely lapel.
-MATT-
"Oh, thank you so much.
It's part of the attire of the establishment, but it is not for sale." He takes it and tugs it back.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I-- Of course not.
-MATT-
"It is our presentation aesthetic, if you will."
-ASHLEY-
Ah, just so well made.
-MATT-
"Well, thank you.
Well, given the fact that you are patrons of the arts, to a certain degree, if you wish to find the name of the individual responsible for making these fine garments, I could pass that to you before the end of the show tonight."
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I would love that.
-MATT-
"I'll go ahead and ask around."
-ASHLEY-
Oh, thank you so much.
-MATT-
"But nevertheless-- Hello, Siran, could you please show our guests to the lower right box as they are our esteemed guests and patrons for the night."
-MARISHA-
Well, all right.
-SAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
You see as a dragonborn comes from through the curtain, looks like an older dragonborn, the scaled brows are droopy on the eyes a bit.
The snout drags a bit.
It's like dark blue scales that go to a lighter blue at the tips of the snout.
-LIAM-
Like a basset hound.
-MATT-
Yeah, very much like a dragonborn basset hound, it comes through and says, "Okay.
I'll show you to your box."
-SAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Shuffles past and leads you on wearing a similar garb, though shorter, not quite as long as the halfling as you pass by.
You do recover six platinum.
(cheering)
-ASHLEY-
I wasn't going to take all of it.
-ROBBIE-
Of course.
-ASHLEY-
So this is good.
Okay, great.
-MARISHA-
Pretty good, pretty good.
-MATT-
With a low roll, you might've found something that wasn't the platinum. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I rolled a 19, so.
-LAURA-
Damn!
-TALIESIN-
Siran, you like working here?
-MATT-
"Ah, it's been fine.
I've been here most of my 10 years here in Jrusar.
Yes."
-ASHLEY-
21.
-TALIESIN-
Say, one of the reasons we came down, we've been hearing like crazy rumors about some of the stuff going down here.
Now, like off the record, you wouldn't have any interesting story? We've heard people disappearing, strange things happening at the theater.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
Nope.
-MARISHA-
He's going the hard way.
-TALIESIN-
Four.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, you are so bad.
-MATT-
"I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I haven't heard anything.
Not quite sure what you're talking about.
We are but a humble home for the arts here in Jrusar."
-TALIESIN-
Yep, yep.
-MATT-
"I'll show you to your seats."
-TALIESIN-
Sorry I asked.
That's good.
-MATT-
As you are all walking through, there's like-- What order are you guys heading in?
-SAM-
Ooh, oh, marching order.
-LAURA-
I imagine Dorian would have been in the lead.
-MATT-
It depends, I don't know how you're feeling.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, stick with the act of air of importance, yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
I'm in the back.
-SAM-
I'll be next to Dorian.
-LAURA-
I'll be next to you.
-LIAM-
How about the dead lady in the center?
-MARISHA-
That's fine.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
I'll be next to F.C.G., wherever that was.
-MATT-
Okay, all right.
-LAURA-
Look like three bodyguards walking behind him.
-MATT-
You all are led to the box.
There's a small door off to the side that leads you to a staircase that leads you into the lower box where you're situated, before it passes onto the upper level.
There inside, you can see it's only six chairs arranged in this space.
The dragonborn gentlemen goes, "Oh, my apologies, there must have been a miscount.
We only have six seats in this box."
-SAM-
That's all right, I don't need to sit.
I'll be fine.
-MATT-
"Very well.
Enjoy the show." He closes the curtain behind him as you all stand there.
The stage is lit, though empty, with the curtain closed at the moment.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-SAM-
Have you been to shows like this in the past? I mean, do you know what we're going to see?
-ROBBIE-
No, nothing like it.
-SAM-
They give you a playbill or anything?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, no, I didn't get one.
I check my seat for a playbill sitting on the seat for us?
-MATT-
There is no playbill.
(laughs)
-LAURA-
No. No program.
-LIAM-
What's the biggest place you-- Oh, you go.
-TALIESIN-
No, I was just scanning the audience, scanning the room, seeing how good of a view we have.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TALIESIN-
Aw, man.
-MARISHA-
So what was the last show you saw?
-LAURA-
How high above the rest of the crowd are we?
-TALIESIN-
16.
-LAURA-
How high is this seat?
-MATT-
You're not in the upper box.
You're in the lower box below it.
So you're maybe 10 feet above the floor.
-MARISHA-
Perfect.
-MATT-
So you're like, you guys are actually in really good seats.
You're just above stage level on the left-hand side.
-TALIESIN-
Never had seats this good for anything.
-MARISHA-
I know, this is nice.
-MATT-
What'd you roll?
-TALIESIN-
16.
-MATT-
16? I mean, people are filtering in, it looks like it's probably not going to be a full house for this matinee.
But it's got a decent enough crowd.
People from all over coming in.
You can see up front, of course, there are people that are well dressed that are making a night of this experience.
This is the first step of their evening out.
Other folks are filling the space to the very back.
You can see there are a handful of soot-covered workers that are in the process of taking off gloves.
So they came here right after work, and some of them look excited.
This is something they've been looking forward to.
This was their treat for the week, if you will.
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to clock people, trying to clock exits.
Just want a general sense of who's where if anyone's hanging back.
-MATT-
Yeah, totally.
-ROBBIE-
From our angle, can we see into the wings a little bit? From where we're at all?
-LIAM-
On the diagonal?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
At a diagonal, no, because the curtains are closed.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, they're closed, okay.
-MATT-
There is a small pocket there, but it's so darkly lit from this distance.
Make a perception check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Good call.
-ROBBIE-
18.
-MATT-
18.
You can see some motion back there.
Not much beyond that, but as you scan back--
-SAM-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Whispers! Whispers!
-LAURA-
Woo!
-TALIESIN-
So many whispers tonight! We're playing Dr. Whispers.
-SAM-
The Exandria Postcard six-pack set features postcards from Emon, Rexxentrum, Roshona, Aeor, Ank'Harel, and Vasselheim.
-TALIESIN-
Whoa.
-SAM-
What did I say?
-MARISHA-
You said Roshona, but so it should be Rosohna.
-SAM-
Happy Rosh Hashanah, everybody.
Whitestone joggers exist.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
And we're back.
-SAM-
That's it.
-MARISHA-
They're very comfy.
-LAURA-
They are.
-MARISHA-
I'm wearing them.
-LAURA-
You're wearing the Nicodranas one!
-MARISHA-
Bam! Sorry.
-SAM-
Or rent.
-TALIESIN-
Share.
Okay.
-LIAM-
I've never even been in a building like this.
What is the largest you've ever played?
-ROBBIE-
Nothing like this, ever.
It's amazing.
I'm just excited for the show, but I know we have things to do, but I'm excited for the show.
Can I be both, is that all right?
-LIAM-
Is this like a lower C, or a lower D, like how many-- How many seats-- (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Do lower Ds even still exists? What's the Equity contract? Is it 768 a week?
-TALIESIN-
This is the group for this event, I don't know if anybody else can appreciate what's happening as much as this group can.
-MATT-
There's a few of you guys out there.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
All the theater kids are watching.
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-LIAM-
How many seats in the house, roughly?
-MATT-
Roughly, at a quick glance, you'd say probably in the neighborhood of 200 and 250.
It's not massive.
-LIAM-
I want to go back to the theater.
-MARISHA-
Wow, it's tiny.
Well, okay, by comparison.
I look up.
-MATT-
They're comfortable, they're not like tight, like packed modern theater seats.
Like every seat is somewhat comfortable and spread out a bit in the space.
-MARISHA-
Cabaret style.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Like, room at the front for--
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
I'd say, actually, including the very, very back row, which is a little more just scattered stools and stuff, there's probably a additional hundred seats beyond that that are just uncomfortable wooden stools to sit on.
But the actual seat-seats you see are probably about 250.
-TALIESIN-
Old school, you got to rent the pillow.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, is it-- How high are the ceilings? Can I see, is there a grid?
-MATT-
There is.
-MARISHA-
Is there a cat walk? Can people come in "Phantom Of The Opera" style?
-TALIESIN-
They've been running Phantom, so there's a giant chandelier.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MARISHA-
You can keep peeking through it.
-TALIESIN-
Still swaying from the previous performance.
-MATT-
Yeah.
And just like Phantom, the cast has done it 600 times and you can tell they're just not into it.
They are just fucking over it and ready to jump into a river.
-ROBBIE-
Funny.
-LIAM-
(flatly) ♪ This I swear by ♪ ♪ the stars ♪
-ROBBIE-
Oh no.
-MATT-
Anyway.
There is no grid, but you do see, there are two upper platforms in each far end, a little bit back and above the box above where you are, where you can see there are individuals holding some sort of tubed arcane device that has like a faint glow at the tip.
You're uncertain what it's used for.
-LIAM-
Pyrotechnics.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
T-shirt cannon, for sure.
-MATT-
Yeah! (laughter) Roll to attack! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
T-shirts going to fuck with your AC, man.
Don't put that on.
-LIAM-
Ranged attack.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-MATT-
The dragonborn usher that brought you here comes through the curtains once more and goes, "I'm terribly sorry.
You-- There is a patron who wishes to speak with you."
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
A patron, sure? Where?
-MATT-
"Just below."
-ASHLEY-
They can come up here.
-MATT-
"They're not allowed up here."
-ASHLEY-
But we paid for this, can't we have anybody up here that we want?
-MATT-
"I suppose so."
-ROBBIE-
Bring them up.
-ASHLEY-
Unless you want to go alone?
-ROBBIE-
No, no--
-MATT-
"I'll go ask."
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Shuffles back out in heads down.
-TALIESIN-
Patron, patron, patron?
-MARISHA-
I like the flex.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that was a good flex.
-ASHLEY-
It's just I didn't want you to go alone.
These Whoppers are delicious.
(laughter) I haven't had one in a while.
-ROBBIE-
I do not know who would know me here, but I will say this, as our friend said, we are very conspicuous.
I saw someone from the Corsairs.
-MARISHA-
What?
-SAM-
Here?
-ROBBIE-
Following us.
-MARISHA-
How do you know?
-ROBBIE-
I saw them, we saw them before at the Elder.
I can't recall the name.
-SAM-
Elder's Post?
-ROBBIE-
Yes, yes.
-SAM-
But we'll see who this is if they come up, and if they don't, if you go down, maybe you should take one of us with you, just as a--
-ROBBIE-
Yes, I'd rather not die, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Happily, happily.
I am in the mood to punch something.
-MATT-
A few moments pass, and you can see more people are filtering in, finding their seats.
You begin to see a handful of musicians that are beginning to head over towards the front of the stage into a small pit up front.
They all look like they're just coming to punch in for the day. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Too real.
-ROBBIE-
Sad.
-LIAM-
Respect.
-MATT-
We've all been there.
Until eventually, the usher returns again.
"The patron is-- Wishes to speak with you alone."
-ROBBIE-
Oh, just a moment.
-MATT-
"Of course."
-SAM-
I guess you got to go.
-TALIESIN-
Sending Stone?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's a good idea.
-SAM-
Or do you want to be a mouse or something?
-LAURA-
I've got a few minutes.
-TALIESIN-
I toss you the Sending Stone anyway.
-ROBBIE-
All right, remind me, how does this?
-LIAM-
You rub it with your thumb.
-ROBBIE-
Rub, rub, and they say--
-LAURA-
Yeah, you have to say it.
-ROBBIE-
I've got to think.
-LAURA-
I will have mental connection with you for a few minutes, at least.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Would you like me to come with you, or do you want to go alone?
-ROBBIE-
I think he said I have to go alone.
-TALIESIN-
Try and stay within sight.
If you're not in sight of this box, make sure that where you are is in that message.
We'll come running at full speed.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-LIAM-
See if you can meet him in the house.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
Keep it public.
All right, I g-g-guess I'll go.
Need to use the restroom, anyway.
And I'll go downstairs.
-MATT-
Okay.
You head down the stairs a little bit after the usher's already left.
As you're heading down the stairway, make a perception check for me.
-ASHLEY-
I don't like this at all.
-LAURA-
I don't, either.
-ASHLEY-
What if this is how people get taken?
-ROBBIE-
Five.
-MATT-
Five.
As you were about to leave the staircase into the open light of the arrangement, you feel a hand grab your chest from the side, a person who was hiding in the shadow there that you didn't notice, who just holds you there.
A voice goes, "What are you doing?"
-ROBBIE-
We, w-w-we're just here to see a show.
-MATT-
"No, what are you doing?"
I-I'm-- We're searching for, we heard someone was missing here.
You look up and you can see like the gauntlet-ed hand of the leather-clad individual, the hood that just barely visible from the light that's creeping through from beyond the curtain, from the main chamber itself, holding you there.
He pulls the hood back and you can see there's the squared jaw and wavy mop of shoulder-length black hair with the gold septum piercing.
Sea glass green eyes of the burly, familiar visage of Cyrus Wyvernwind.
Who goes, "What are you doing?"
-ROBBIE-
I'm on my own.
Let go of me! And I'm going to push his hand away.
-MATT-
He looks nervously about.
"We need to talk."
-ROBBIE-
Here, now?
-MATT-
"Soon."
-ROBBIE-
Fine.
Just-- How are you here? How did you get away?
-MATT-
"Same way you did."
-ROBBIE-
No.
Mother, Father, what are they doing without you?
-MATT-
"I don't know.
I just-- followed your lead." As he looks down at you, your taller brother.
-MARISHA-
(gasps)
-MATT-
"Maybe we are meant to wander, I don't know." His hand reaches out, and this time less aggressively, but he presses it against your chest and says-- "We'll talk."
-ROBBIE-
We should.
-MATT-
"After."
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-MATT-
Then just goes through the curtain and back into the main room.
-ROBBIE-
I'll take a minute to collect myself, and give it a second, however long I think it would take.
And then I'll go back upstairs, shake it off, and I'll pull back the curtain to our booth.
Just a lot of nothing.
Someone who'd seen me play at a-- Well, I told you I'm from here.
Maybe they saw me playing, saw me up in the seats, and they were wondering if I was part of the show.
If I knew anyone, just an old patron.
-SAM-
You're famous.
-ROBBIE-
No! Well, I guess so, if someone recognized me from that far away, thanks.
-SAM-
Pretty cool.
-ROBBIE-
Appreciate it.
Anyway, I'm so excited for the show.
-MATT-
At this point, you start hearing the different instruments beginning to warm up a bit.
Begin to play.
The interior of the room, the chatter and laughter and whispers, and the sounds of an audience growing impatient begins to subside as the music begins to swell.
As the lights begin to brighten from those two platforms, an arcane beam of magical sunlight emitted onto the stage from above onto the curtain.
As the room falls into silence, beyond the music playing.
As you all adjust to your positions, look out over.
Dorian, you just can't help but be lost in thought.
As we finish there for tonight.
(shouting and groaning)
-MARISHA-
Damn it.
-LIAM-
I'm going to sneak one last little detail in there.
That is that as soon as Dorian gets back, Orym untenses his hand and realizes how hard he's been gripping Sending Stone.
Then shoves it back into his pack.
-MATT-
You got it.
We'll pick up from there next week at the Dreamscape Theater.
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
So much intrigue.
-LIAM-
Ah, I want to go to the theater.
-SAM-
You've got a brother?
-ROBBIE-
I do.
-SAM-
And you've got a letter?
-TALIESIN-
Yes, I do.
You got three of them, so.
-LIAM-
And you're dead?
-LAURA-
And you got money? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
What the fuck's that about?
-MARISHA-
You learn so much about-- (laughter)
-MATT-
Oh, I love it.
All righty, we'll pick up from there next week.
-ASHLEY-
Damn it, I want to keep playing!
-MATT-
I know, I know.
Thank you all so much for joining us.
We'll see you next week to continue this adventure.
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
(cheering)

Critical Role Campaign 2 Episode 113 "A Heart Grown Cold"
-MATT-
Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
-TRAVIS-
(hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! (all clamoring)
-MATT-
Happy to have you back.
Before we get into tonight's episode, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with the first of our two sponsors for the evening.
The first up, which is Ravensburger. Sam.
-SAM-
(scoffing) No, Matt, please, do not use my secret identity, for the world only knows me as the notorious Boomerang.
No? Boomerang?
-LIAM-
Oh.
-SAM-
Boomerang, the orbital outlaw? The Sinister Stick, the Aerodynamic Desperado? No? Boomerang? Not ringing a bell?
-TRAVIS-
Terrible name.
-SAM-
Cool, cool, anyway, this episode is sponsored by Marvel Villainous, from our friends at Ravensburger.
The next chapter of the villainous game system allows players to take on the role of a Marvel villain of their choice and face off against Earth's mightiest heroes to achieve their dastardly objectives.
Players can choose from Thanos, Hela, Killmonger, Ultron, Taskmaster from the upcoming Black Widow film, and of course...
Boomerang isn't an option.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
No Boomerang? Boomerang, the spinniest supervillain of them all? No?
-MARISHA-
"Spinniest"?
-SAM-
Goddamn it, I'm going to kill my agent.
She said this was in the bag! I even wrote some new catch phrases, ready?
-MATT-
Oh, no.
-SAM-
"Okay, boomer!" Eh? No?
-ALL-
(groaning)
-SAM-
How about, "You rang?" No?
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay.
-LIAM-
Fuck you.
It's so quiet in here.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-SAM-
"Ya!" Of course, in real life it would come back, I know how to use a boomerang.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-SAM-
Anyway.
The game is available now in the U.S. and U.K. at bit.ly/critrolemarvelvillainous, and, as always with Ravensburger, enter for a chance to win a copy of the game by heading over to Ravensburger NA-- sorry, @RavensburgerNA on Twitter, where they're giving away copies of the game right now.
And remember Boomerang will always...
"see you around."
-TRAVIS-
Woof.
-LAURA-
Oh, wow.
-SAM-
Boomerang!
-TRAVIS-
Did that boomerang have bullet holes in it?
-SAM-
I don't know.
(laughter) I was supposed to bring my boomerang from home, but I didn't, and then Max had to make one.
(laughter) He made it out of cardboard for Boomerang! I think he used a piece of cardboard that had been used to do painting on before.
-TRAVIS-
That looked super street tough.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
It leant it cred.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
And hang onto that costume, though, cause we'll use it later.
-SAM-
Boomerang!
-MATT-
I'm not going to lie, it is making me miss the Tick show, though.
-MARISHA-
Oh yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Just shouting your name, is your catchphrase?
-MATT-
The special--
-SAM-
Thanos, Boomerang!
-MATT-
Special power to just induce endless cringe on their enemies.
Avengers are like, "Oh! (inhales sharply) Mm!"
-LAURA-
"I feel guilty fighting him.
He's just so pathetic."
-MATT-
All right. Thank you, Sam.
And thank you, Ravensburger. (laughing) Our second sponsor tonight, our friends since beginning of campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond.

It's written by the amazing Liz Marsham, and interviews from all of us are scattered throughout, from the beginning experiences all the way up to current day.
There's a bunch of great pictures and odd elements of our history, even our home game, as well as behind the scenes looks that you don't see anywhere else.
It includes introduction by Felicia Day, friend of the show and friend of ours.
It features brand new illustrations by Oliver Barrett, and photography by Ray Kachatorian.
And the audio book is read by our very own Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
(cheering)
And the foreword of the book is read by Felicia Day herself, wrote it, so, fantastic.
So if you were in the U.S., Canada, or the U.K., you can pick up your copy right now, wherever books are sold, including Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or at your local independent bookstore.
The book is also available in a hard cover, like this, as well as eBook, audio book formats, and actually there-- I got to show a couple more things in here.
-TRAVIS-
You get to show more?
-MATT-
Yeah.
Here's--
-LAURA-
Oh cool, yes!
-MATT-
Interior collection.
-TRAVIS-
Tilt it down, aw yeah.
-MARISHA-
Aww!
-MATT-
This is the inner page there, a bunch of names, maybe you'll find yourself in there.
We also have some awesome interior art.
-SAM-
Ooh, cool.
-MATT-
Character moments there.
-MARISHA-
Get it.
-LIAM-
It'll put you right back in the campaign.
-MATT-
And here's a moment that some people are familiar with this campaign will recognize.
-LIAM-
Oh yeah, hello.
-TRAVIS-
Just a little bit.
-ASHLEY-
Put your fate in your hands--
-LAURA-
Roll the dice!
-MATT-
I'm going to randomly pick a page here, because I can.
-SAM-
You can?
-MATT-
Oh yeah, this is cool--
-LAURA-
You can pick any page?
-TRAVIS-
He can do whatever he wants.
-MATT-
I can do whatever I want, it's out.
And they have some artistic reinterpretations of some of the original maps when we first started streaming.
(cheering)
-LIAM-
That's our first battle, right?
-MATT-
The very first battle we streamed, out in Kraghammer.
-LAURA-
That's awesome!
-TRAVIS-
The little baby.
-LAURA-
Wait, was that the-- then the serpent thingy come out?
-MATT-
Yeah, it was--
-LIAM-
The naga?
-MATT-
Yeah, the--
-SAM-
Don't say it, they'll have to get the book to find out.
-LAURA-
Oh, sorry, sorry.
-TRAVIS-
Then you found that hidden door, and I knew we were in the wrong, we were outclassed.
-MATT-
Yeah, that's okay, but for more information, check out criticalrolebooks.com.
Laura, you got some things to talk about.
-LAURA-
Oh, I do.
I have to show you guys this, doo doo doo doo, I don't know if you can see it.
-TRAVIS-
There you go, look, it's great.
-LAURA-
Look at that, it's our very own Caduceus Clay, made by our buddies at Steamforged.
(cheering) Yeah-- oh, that's it.
He goes with the rest of the Mighty Nein set, it was specifically made for that.
(laughter) I got it right.
And this is available along with the Mighty Nein entire set in the U.S. and the U.K. stores right now.
-SAM-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
Caddy.
-MATT-
Brilliance.
All right, I believe--
-LAURA-
It's really good, Tal; I don't know if you've seen it.
-TALIESIN-
I've got one right here.
I'm just thinking maybe I should make some more minis.
Sorry. (laughing)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I know where you're going with that.
-LAURA-
Don't you even.
-TRAVIS-
Molly comes creeping back, and all of a sudden he's a power.
-LIAM-
Why is Caduceus throwing himself off the side of the ship? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
No, really.
-SAM-
Boomerang!
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
Are you going to--
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
Please stay in that the entire episode.
-SAM-
I will not stay in this! Boomerang!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, jesus!
-MATT-
On that note, our announcements are complete, so let's jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

-MATT-
And welcome back.
(laughter)
So last we left off, the Mighty Nein, upon realizing that an old friend of theirs seemed to be trudging his way northward in a similar direction, you gathered your materials, you finished up your business as quickly as you could, hastened your plans underneath Lady Vess DeRogna and made your journey to the northern tip of the Greying Wildlands, to the village of-- Palebank Village, acquired passage on the Midnight Hammer, an icebreaker ship, heading to Eiselcross and began to work your way across the dangerous Frozen Depths that lay between there and your target location.
A few days at sea had been a little rough at first go.
Some unlucky rolls and some unfortunate challenges found their way your direction, including here on what I believe is the fifth day of your journey.
A massive crackling ice storm began to blow its way into your path.
As people on the ship began to batten down and prepare for it, Caduceus, you picked up some sort of strange clicking sound that seemed to be sourceless from the outside of the boat.
There, you watched as these massive crustacean-like creatures began to claw back onto the top of the ship, similar to creatures that you all have seen in the past.
After having a brief skirmish with them, seemingly getting the better hand, or the upper hand of this, a familiar humanoid creature with a split jaw and somewhat aquatic appearance clambered up the opposite side of the ship, reached out, and shattered the amber necklace that Caleb keeps carefully on his person.
In doing so, the contents of it spilling out of its solidified dimensional space, including the cloven crystal, the last key to Uk'otoa's unleashing.
In the middle of this chaos, Fjord, you glance over to notice that rising over the edge of the ship is none other than Captain Avantika.
Paler than you recall, her chest and torso currently encased in jagged ice, her breath giving off this mist.
As she looks to you with cold, faintly, glowing eyes, and a wicked grin, her neck somewhat off kilter, and seems to be inviting this...
reunion.
And that's where we left off, in the middle of this struggle and fight.
-LIAM-
So excited.
-MATT-
From the top of this--
-LAURA-
Hoo-kay!
-MATT-
-- combat round, we come to Beauregard.
-MARISHA-
O-o-o-h.
-LAURA-
Kick us off.
-MATT-
You had just found yourself charmed briefly, and then come back to, wiping the influence from your eyes.
However, you are still grappled in the claws of a charmed creature, who is now currently incapacitated and just clutching you in this tightened grip.
-TRAVIS-
Totally strategized for this.
-MARISHA-
Does disengage-- can I disengage from grapple if I--
-MATT-
No, you have-- it's an action to break free, and you have to roll versus its strength.
It has disadvantage, though.
I will say-- yeah.
-MARISHA-
It has disadvantage on strength?
-MATT-
Because it's incapacitated at the moment, I'll say, circumstantially, right now, because it can't take actions.
It's just currently standing there dazzled by the hypnotic pattern that held it there.
It's not as strong as it once was in the moment, because it is distracted.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, yeah, I'll try that.
So, wait, it's contested strength roll?
-MATT-
Correct.
-MARISHA-
Saving throw, or--
-MATT-
No, just a strength check.
-LIAM-
Straight roll.
-MARISHA-
No.
-LIAM-
In strength.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LAURA-
You can do it.
-MARISHA-
Aah!
-TALIESIN-
Cocked.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Four.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
You are unable to break free from its grasp.
As you try and pull your way out, it's just too tightly wrapped around your torso.
You feel the jagged edges of the claw grind into the flesh and hurt just a bit, You're not going to get out.
-SAM-
So incapacitated doesn't mean they let go of everything and--
-MATT-
No, it depends on-- incapacitated technically means they do not have actions or bonus actions, they can't do anything, they're not asleep.
They're just currently dazed by the spell.
-SAM-
In whatever state they were in.
-TALIESIN-
That wasn't a save throw, was it?
-LAURA-
No.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-SAM-
I'd like to think they do lose control of their bowels, though.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Sure, yeah, we'll go with that.
-LIAM-
Scat all over--
-MATT-
A terrifying smell of crustacean shit now completely fills the side of the boat.
-LAURA-
How do crustaceans poop? Is it like long strings like fish, or is it--
-LIAM-
It's pretty liquid, it's pretty liquid, yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay, just checking.
-MATT-
Yeah. ♪ The more you know! ♪ Beauregard, what you doing?
-MARISHA-
I guess I'm stuck here, I might as well punch it in the face.
-MATT-
Well, you used your action to break through.
-MARISHA-
(forlornly) But I can do bonus action Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
You can't do Flurry of Blows, because I believe you have to use your action as part of an attack action, but you can get--
-MARISHA-
But I can do an extra attack? Can I do an extra attack?
-TRAVIS-
Keep pushing with the lower lip.
-MATT-
I'll allow it, go for it. You can make one attack.
-LIAM-
(sadly) "I'm a monk of the Cobalt Soul."
-MARISHA-
So does it have to be a standard attack, or can I do-- can I do my--
-TRAVIS-
Thought for sure she'd get out of that.
-MARISHA-
-- my Belabor?
-MATT-
That's an action, that's an action.
-MARISHA-
That's an action.
-LIAM-
She's as weak as a wizard.
-MATT-
This-- believe it or not, there are some circumstances where a monk can't do everything.
-SAM-
Wow.
-MATT-
They're rare. I found it!
-LAURA-
We found it!
-MARISHA-
So wait, are you saying I can just attack?
-MATT-
You get one punch.
-MARISHA-
(sadly) I punch it.
-SAM-
One punch, Beau.
-MARISHA-
One Punch Beau.
-SAM-
Whoa, that was a weird roll.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it was, but it was a 17, so I take it for 27.
-MATT-
27 hits.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Saddest hit ever.
-MARISHA-
Cocked, I had such a-- aw, man.
Seven.
-MATT-
Seven points of damage.
-MARISHA-
Stunning Strike!
-MATT-
Whack! All right.
-MARISHA-
I can do that!
-SAM-
She's happy again.
-MATT-
That is 17?
-TALIESIN-
Take your d4.
-MARISHA-
Damn it-- wait, what?
-TALIESIN-
Take your d4.
-MATT-
Oh, minus d4, because it--
-LAURA-
Oh, he's baned, baby.
-MATT-
There you go, 15.
-MARISHA-
Stunned!
-MATT-
Stunned.
-SAM-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Fucker.
-MATT-
So.
-TALIESIN-
Not you, it.
-MATT-
Stunned, fucker! (laughter)
-LAURA-
Can I say, in that moment before he was stunned, as she punched him did he move at all?
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
Damn it.
-MATT-
So he's no longer charmed, as you punched the charm out of him, so-- (gurgly growling) and now it's-- the impact, this delayed reaction as you slam it right in the area where the metal plates hit, or the hard crustacean plates hit, and it seems to have sent a shock through his nervous system, and he's currently trying to recalibrate.
-MARISHA-
Does that cancel his grapple?
-MATT-
No, he's still holding onto you.
-LIAM-
It's just, the tendons are all locked up.
-MATT-
Yeah, incapacitated.
-TALIESIN-
It's okay.
-MATT-
Can't take actions or reactions is technically what it means.
But you still have to break free.
-TRAVIS-
Veth, where are you on the ship?
-SAM-
I'm towards the bow-- the stern.
-MATT-
That finishes Beau's turn?
-MARISHA-
Yep.
-MATT-
All right, Fjord, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Shit, fuck, balls, anus.
-MARISHA-
Didn't go as well-- sorry.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. Uh...
(gibberish, operatic singing) I will respond by seeing my ex-- dead ex just pop up on the ship.
She is on the ship! Is she on the railing, or did she hop over in both feet are on the deck?
-MATT-
She's like up on the edge of the railing, and attempted to try and chuck you off the side, and then when you resisted, she just stays there.
Starts stepping over the edge and is drawing both the rapier and the dagger that she's holding out to the edges--
-TRAVIS-
God, I really just want to Spartan and kick her off the boat.
-LAURA-
Do it.
-MATT-
If you want to.
-TRAVIS-
That's an action, though.
-SAM-
And if you miss you'll look real dumb.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
(laughter) ♪ And my strength ain't the best ♪
-LIAM-
That sounds win-win to me. I'd go for it.
-SAM-
This is Spart-- whoa!
-LAURA-
Don't you have the Eldritch Blast that blasts people back or something? No?
-TRAVIS-
Nope, I didn't take that.
With my bonus action, I'm going to cast a Hexblade's Curse at Avantika.
-MATT-
Okay, you got it.
-SAM-
Hex.
-TALIESIN-
Nice.
-LAURA-
Aw, hex.
-SAM-
-- blade's curse.
-MATT-
We'll say she is currently cursed by you.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
I am going to move directly over the cloven crystal.
I'll use my 30 feet to run to where it lies on the deck.
-MATT-
Okay, you're going to run this way?
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
All right.
She gets an attack of opportunity against you.
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Which she will take...
with her rapier.
-TALIESIN-
Hangin' on the side of the boat.
-MATT-
It's a 21 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Hits. Is there any bane on her? There's not.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-MATT-
Bane doesn't help the attack roll.
-TALIESIN-
Actually--
-MATT-
It's saving--
-TALIESIN-
Not that she's baned.
-MATT-
Right, I believe bane is saving throws.
-TALIESIN-
And attack rolls.
-MATT-
And attack rolls as well, you're right.
-TALIESIN-
But she's not baned.
-MATT-
But she's not, you're right.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, sorry.
-MATT-
That's okay.
However, that is...
16 points of piercing damage.
-TRAVIS-
Hold on.
I'm going to roll a d6, because she's been hexblade cursed.
And with my Armor of Hexes, if I roll a four or higher, she misses.
-MATT-
Yes, she does.
-TRAVIS-
Which she does, I got a five.
-MATT-
So swings with the rapier and the dark shadows that currently swirl around her torso reach out and grab her arm and pull it just wide out of the way, and it swings past your body as you rush over.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-LAURA-
That's titties.
-TRAVIS-
Standing over the cloven crystal, with it between my feet, I'm going to use my--
-LAURA-
Just sit down.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to put it in my butt.
(laughter) Get back in me, cloven crystal!
-MATT-
What you doing?
-TRAVIS-
One flap, a trap, or in the other.
I am going to--
-LIAM-
Old habits die hard.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to use my action to use my channel divinity.
I'm going to Create Marine Layer.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you and heavily obscures the area for 20 feet in all directions, follows me as I move.
You and any other creatures you choose within five feet of you can see through the fog and suffer no penalties from being within it.
This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners and cannot be dispersed.
-SAM-
Sorry, did you can just say that you and your allies can see through the fog?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
If they're right next to him.
-SAM-
Ah.
-LAURA-
Oh, so if we wander into it we won't be able to see it until we get next to Fjord?
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
So all of you who are looking in that direction, you watch as Fjord rushes over, down to where the crystal is, grabs the sword, and then suddenly apparating from around him, this heavy fog just fills the center of the ship, and you have no idea-- You can't see across the ship, you can't see where Fjord is.
You just lost a visibility on half the ship.
-TRAVIS-
I just go-- (foghorn)
-MATT-
There you go.
That's his battle cry, whenever he uses that feature.
-TRAVIS-
(high horn)
-MATT-
No, that's <i>my</i> battle cry.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, okay.
-MATT-
Don't step.
-TRAVIS-
That's the end of that.
-MATT-
Okay, that's the end of Fjord's turn.
Got it. Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so, since I see that Beau is grappled, I'm going to try and cut off the pincer from the lobstrosity.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
So, just going to turn and try to start hacking away.
-MARISHA-
"Lobstrosity"!
-MATT-
Start hacking at the one that's currently holding on to Beauregard?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'm going to try to hack away at that arm.
-MATT-
All right, so you got your two attacks on that.
-ASHLEY-
So...
17?
-MATT-
17 hits.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
Let me get some dice.
-SAM-
Rock lobster.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to do Savage Attacker, because that was kind of low.
Much better.
32.
-SAM-
Whoa!
-MATT-
32 points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Yo, let's go!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All righty, first strike, as you swing wide with a blade, carve through the heavy chunk of its body, you watch as part of the armor that blocks the part of the face is now carved in two, and this dark purple viscera is now hanging out and bleeding as its clicking sound has now become this warbling-- (grunting) it's in pain.
-ASHLEY-
All right, let's see if we can do a little more.
-MARISHA-
Are you rolling with advantage?
-ASHLEY-
No.
-MARISHA-
Stunned.
-ASHLEY-
(grunts)
-MATT-
Yes.
Yeah, okay, that would be a 23.
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
That hits, second strike.
-ASHLEY-
So...
25 for the second hit.
-MATT-
25 points of damage?
-ASHLEY-
25 points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Well done, let's go.
-MATT-
So, two times through, this creature's looking pretty dang hurt.
It's still currently standing upright, though it is stunned from your strike.
It's not long for this world if this were to continue, but it is still holding onto Beauregard best it can.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so then as my bonus action, I would like to use Zealous Presence and let out a battle cry.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Which gives 10 other creatures in 60 feet advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh shit!
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-SAM-
Wait, what?
-ASHLEY-
Attacks and saving throws?
-MARISHA-
Attacks and saving throws.
-LIAM-
Name this feature again--
-ASHLEY-
'Til my next turn.
-LIAM-
-- so we can fall in love with it.
-MATT-
Everybody except for Jester.
Jester, you're just outside her range.
-ASHLEY-
Zealous Presence.
-MARISHA-
She's done it once or twice before.
-LAURA-
Oh no, it's okay, it's my fault, I should've been closer to you.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no.
Wait, no, aren't you up on the--
-LAURA-
My duplicate is next to you.
-MATT-
Duplicate's next to you.
-LAURA-
My duplicate feels really invigorated.
-MATT-
That's true, that's true.
-ASHLEY-
60 feet.
-TRAVIS-
That's huge.
-SAM-
Who else is within 60 feet?
-TRAVIS-
Everybody except Jester.
-SAM-
Me, too?
-TRAVIS-
Yup.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Cool.
-TRAVIS-
That's huge.
-TALIESIN-
That's magical.
-ASHLEY-
I feel like I've used it before.
-MATT-
You've used it before, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, yeah.
-MATT-
So it's for one round, until Yasha's next turn.
-ASHLEY-
Til my next turn, so.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
All right, so that finishes your go Yasha?
-ASHLEY-
That finishes my go.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Everybody, punch somebody.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TRAVIS-
Even the wizard.
-MATT-
It is now Avantika's turn.
-TRAVIS-
After Yasha?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Oh, she goes with the creatures?
-MATT-
Well she's going before them, actually.
-MATT-
In her initiative order.
So after watching Fjord rush off, she watches the fog emerge and cocks her head a little bit.
"Very interesting." And is going to dart into the fog, is going to rush past you, and is going to make an investigation check with disadvantage because of the fog that's in this space.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-SAM-
Did you pick it up or did you just--
-TRAVIS-
No, I just--
-SAM-
You fogged it.
-TRAVIS-
-- stood over it, yeah.
-LIAM-
Six things--
-MATT-
She actually rolled pretty well, okay.
Oh, and you can see this.
She passes by you and vaguely sees your shadow, even though you're heavily obscured at that point, and she just darts to the ground and starts rummaging through the elements of loose fireworks.
But since the ball rolled this far, it's almost solitary there on the center of the ground, and it gives off its own faint, soft yellow glow, almost in the proximity of Avantika.
And she reaches down and grabs it with one hand, putting the dagger away.
And with the rapier in her other hand, she stands up-- No, that's all of her movement.
-LAURA-
(squeals)
-MATT-
But she currently has the crystal in her possession and learns--
-SAM-
She's in fog, so we did not see her pick it up.
-LIAM-
So everyone outside the fog can't see her, only Fjord sees her.
-MATT-
All you saw was her vanish into the fog after Fjord.
-LIAM-
Caduceus sees her, though, yeah?
-MATT-
No, Caduceus can't see anything.
Caduceus, right now, suddenly, you have no visibility.
You are lost in fog and everything around you just went fucking--
-TALIESIN-
The last thing I saw was Fjord do a thing.
-MATT-
Yeah.
It's a problem. It doesn't feel oppressive.
It just feels problem.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
And I have a question, DM.
Everyone on this side of the ship, once this fog's up, wouldn't have been able to see her enter into it either, right? Like isn't it--
-MATT-
Correct, everyone on this side has no idea what's transpired at this point.
Only probably Yasha and Beau would have any idea--
-MARISHA-
Where she went.
-MATT-
But you guys are also a little distracted.
At most you would have just seen her just dart into the fog and that's it.
-LAURA-
I have a question.
Can I see above the fog since I was up on the stairs?
-MATT-
The fog is 20 feet in a full radius.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So no, you cannot see the other side of the ship.
That finishes Avantika's turn.
Crawling up onto this side of the ship, of her, you see this weird almost toad-like demon creature--
-LAURA-
Jesus.
-MATT-
It has this faint pulsing glow to it, like it has runes on its chest.
Some sort of-- you can make an arcana check.
-LIAM-
Hell yeah.
That's high, that is...
26.
-MATT-
26.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You acknowledge this here as a-- you acknowledge this as-- usually the effects that are given off by a creature that has been summoned.
It is being held here for a time by some sort of magic.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
But it comes into the side here and darts over to you.
Right as you recognize this, it goes in your direction with these large extended claws out on both sides of its hands.
It's going to come over to you for one strike here.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck.
-LAURA-
Oh my God.
-MATT-
That is a 22 to hit.
-LIAM-
Yeah, hits. Hits.
-MATT-
Hits, all right.
You take...
11 points of slashing damage.
It's going to attack again.
22 again.
-LIAM-
Yeah, hits.
-MATT-
Shitty rolls. 10 points of slashing damage.
And then one more time, it's going to-- that's cocked, actually.
-TRAVIS-
And you've got your stone, right?
-MATT-
That's 17 points, 17 to hit.
-LIAM-
Hits.
-MATT-
Hits, okay.
You then take...
okay, there it is-- okay, 15 points of slashing damage.
And then after it's like-- (hissing) It vanishes.
-MARISHA-
What?
-SAM-
It's like a blink monster?
-MATT-
It's going to appear right behind Jester on the staircase.
-LAURA-
Mother--
-MATT-
And you feel these feet hit the wood behind you as you glance over, and the thing that you just saw assault Caleb is now behind you-- (grunting) its tongue dangling out over this jagged row of teeth on the bottom jaw.
-SAM-
I'm staring to think those lobsters were not our biggest foe.
(laughter)
-MATT-
That finishes its go.
-MARISHA-
Just a pain in the ass.
-MATT-
And then--
-SAM-
Oh no, more things.
-TALIESIN-
Jesus.
-MATT-
Another one of these crustacean creatures crawls up on the opposite end.
-LIAM-
That's why he didn't want to go long the other-- last game.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
Jumps down the center of the ship.
-MARISHA-
It's really big! Wait, is it bigger, or is it just the angle of the camera?
-MATT-
The angle looks bigger. It's the same as the others.
-LAURA-
Oh my God, you're huge!
-MATT-
Does it have Kosher salt all over it? (laughter)
I like to make sure my minis are properly treated.
-MARISHA-
When a spider crawls in front of your Nest cam.
You're like-- (yelling) It's this big.
(chuckling)
-MATT-
It's going to make--
-SAM-
That would be sea salt. That makes much more sense.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that looks massive.
-MARISHA-
It looks huge.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, man.
-MATT-
Oh, because I forgot Yasha, make a constitution saving throw for me, please.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, okay.
-SAM-
Veth is like, "Hi, it's right behind me, isn't it?" (laughter) "It's right behind me."
-MARISHA-
You can feel the breath.
-SAM-
Yeah, oh god.
-ASHLEY-
17? Oh wait, I can roll again.
-MATT-
You're fine.
-ASHLEY-
It doesn't matter, okay.
-MATT-
Something I forgot last time, since we were at the end of the game, but the narrative is maintained.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Veth, you hear the-- (crash) and as you look over your shoulder, you see the creature right there bearing down on you, and it begins swiping at you both with its pincers.
-SAM-
Yikes.
-MATT-
The first one is...
19 to hit.
-SAM-
Hits.
-MATT-
All right.
You take--
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, man.
-TRAVIS-
I had two ideas.
That was the wrong one.
-MATT-
15 points of bludgeoning damage, and you are grappled.
-SAM-
I'll Uncanny Dodge, I guess, to reduce it to seven, eight points?
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
Eight points? Eight points.
-MATT-
And it's going to use its tentacles for its second attack.
Well, actually it can do both, because you are grappled by it now.
The second strike has come at you.
That is going to be in 23 to hit.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
That one deals-- ooh! 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
And what you notice, as it grabs you with the claw, and you're currently grappled in its grip by it, you're pulled in, and underneath its armor, you watch as dozens of these tiny little tentacles (growling) unroll out and begin to wrap and stick to you like tiny little leeches.
And as it does, it begins to pump poison into your body.
Make a constitution saving throw for me, please.
-SAM-
My constitution is not very high.
17.
-MATT-
17, you manage to resist the poison. You are fine.
-LIAM-
Hey, DM?
-MATT-
Yes?
-LIAM-
You and I both forgot, even though I called it out at the top of the game, I have Mirror Image up.
So I have to roll three times for each of those attacks to see if they hit.
-MATT-
That's true.
-LIAM-
And if it's six or higher-- the first one, first one's a natural 20, so it hits a dupe.
-MATT-
Okay, so that's one dupe down.
-LIAM-
Second one is a four, so it hits me.
-MATT-
Okay, so the first hit did not go through.
-LIAM-
Right, second one did.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
And the third one, it must be an eight or higher, it was a nine.
-MATT-
All right, so only the middle attack--
-LIAM-
The middle attack hit.
-MATT-
So mark off your damage on the first and third, which I did not recall.
-LIAM-
Right.
I'll put two thirds back.
-MATT-
Sure, we'll go with that.
-LIAM-
Yep.
-MATT-
But you have one duplicate left.
-LIAM-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right, that finishes their turn.
Veth, you're up. Caleb you're on deck.
-SAM-
I am grappled?
-MATT-
You are grappled currently.
-SAM-
Does that mean I cannot complete--
-MATT-
You can't move, but you can--
-SAM-
-- the somatic portions of a spell or the-- what's the VSM? I always fucking forget.
-MATT-
No, you can, you can.
All that grappled means is your speed is zero until you break out of the grapple.
-MARISHA-
But you can still do actions.
-MATT-
You can still do spells and actions and attacks and stuff.
-SAM-
Oh, so I can shoot, I can shoot this fucker if I wanted to.
-MATT-
Correct.
-SAM-
I don't want to.
Even though I'm grappled, I'm going to hold my action until I see Avantika.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
I think I will hold Phantasmal Force.
-MATT-
Okay.
You got it, all right.
So you will hold onto that, cool.
That brings us to Caleb. Jester, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Okay, I've never done this before, but as part of my movement I'm going to use the Stormrider Boots, and use 90 feet of movement to fly on an angle curving around the lobster.
I'm going to strafe the mage fishman up at the top and then curve back.
-MATT-
Back over here, you mean?
-LIAM-
I'm going to go in a big curve, so I want to zap the lobster and I want to zap the mage, but then double back around and float over the top of the fog by about like 30 or 40 feet.
-MATT-
Okay, so you wanted to zoom up here and buzz all three of them?
-LIAM-
No.
-MATT-
Or this way? You have 90 feet of movement, so you can go like--
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And then this way, you mean?
-LIAM-
That's right.
So I'm going to get two of them, not three of them.
Lobster man, dude at the top, and then float on top, and then as my action, I'm going to cast Fly.
-MATT-
Okay, good call.
-LIAM-
30 feet up--
-MATT-
But before we get to that, there are two attacks opportunity on you.
-LIAM-
That's right, at disadvantage.
-MATT-
At disadvantage, exactly.
-LIAM-
And they take damage regardless.
-MATT-
Yes, so roll damage for them.
Just roll once and they'll both take it.
-MARISHA-
Bonus action dash.
-LIAM-
They take nine points of lightning damage each.
-MATT-
Nice, so as you activate the boots, there's this giant spark of energy right beneath where your knees are.
As you take off, like an Ironman suit, you watch as the blast back, shocks the crustacean.
You spin around and arc off beyond the fishman mage up top, who gets hit and is going to try and swing for you, too.
Crustacean, two strikes against you is...
14 to hit, which I think misses.
-LIAM-
Misses.
-MATT-
And the other guy is going to swing with his sword.
No, that's a 10.
Sorry, that's a 14. That still misses you.
All right, and so you arc over and you cast Fly, so you are now flying up in the air over where this fog is, essentially.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
We'll say up in this space.
All righty, so you are now flying, you are concentrating.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Here ya go.
Finishing Caleb's turn. Jester, you're up, Caduceus, you're on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Mage?
-MATT-
No, Jester's up.
-TRAVIS-
I thought the mage went after Caduceus.
-LAURA-
Everything's messed up. Everything's messed up! (yells) Everything's concentration that I have! I'm freaking out!
-MATT-
It's challenging.
-LAURA-
(whispers) Okay.
-LIAM-
Spell casters.
-LAURA-
Okay, I know right away for my bonus action, I'm just going to use my Spiritual Weapon that I have up.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-LAURA-
And I'm going to hit the stunned one that's holding Beau.
-MATT-
Roll damage on that.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Well, roll attack on that and then damage.
-MARISHA-
(quietly) Is that my husband? With magic sequins?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That's beautiful.
-MATT-
Ah, Jesus.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Ah jeez.
-TALIESIN-
Suddenly another crab--
-SAM-
It's hard to tell, but I think it's you as a doctor?
-MATT-
Yeah, that's one of my old shitty head shots.
People are like, "You need to make character head shots" and I'm like, "All right." (laughter)
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, roll an attack.
-MARISHA-
It was either that or a BTS shirt--
-LAURA-
With advantage.
-MARISHA-
-- I couldn't tell from here.
-MATT-
Yes, because it is stunned.
-LIAM-
Unstoppable, this bit.
-LAURA-
19?
-MATT-
19, that definitely hits.
-LAURA-
Does that hit?
-MATT-
Yep.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
2d8.
I have all these dice, and I don't know which ones are which. I'm freaking out! (panicked grunting) Where's my eight? There they are, okay.
-LIAM-
This is so cool.
-SAM-
She's going to jump over the fucking edge.
-LAURA-
Five, 13 plus five is 18--
-SAM-
Of course, I don't know that.
-LAURA-
-- points of damage.
-MATT-
How much is it?
-LAURA-
18 points of damage with my serrated lollipop.
-LIAM-
We had other ideas. I just threw them out.
-MATT-
Great.
-MARISHA-
I feel responsible.
-TRAVIS-
So do I.
-MARISHA-
For fucking up the--
-MATT-
All right, that guy is hurt real bad.
He's barely hanging on and is like-- (grunting)
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Is this the stunned guy?
-MATT-
Yes, but the other guy's no longer stunned.
-LAURA-
Jester-- me, that's me, for <i>my</i> thing, I'm going to do--
-SAM-
You're Jester?
-LAURA-
I'm Jester.
(laughter)
I'm going to cast...
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Yes? You are going to cast...?
-LAURA-
I don't know how to say it.
Hold on, hold on.
This is everybody. It doesn't save against my own people.
I don't like that.
Okay, so, am I surrounded? Can I move?
-MATT-
You are currently-- you have a giant crustacean to the right of you, you have this other weird demon creature to the back of you, and you have Veth currently grappled to the front of you, as well as one of the crewmen who is trying to arm and put a bolt up into one of these ballista,.
and is just freaking out.
Like, "Ah, ah!"
-TRAVIS-
We're running, it's bad.
-SAM-
♪ Stuck in the middle with you ♪
-MARISHA-
♪ with y--♪ I--
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast...
-MATT-
Yeah?
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast..
Insect Plague at fifth level.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
What about Wreck Undead Girlfriends?
-LAURA-
So that's a 20 foot sphere around me.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Maybe just mend those fences, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah, just patch it up.
(chuckling) Nothing a silver tongue can't cure.
-LIAM-
Right there, switch to persuasion.
-TRAVIS-
"I've thought about your every day since you got your head turned around 180 degrees."
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
Nope, no, I'm going to-- mm.
(frantic humming)
-MATT-
Laura?
-LAURA-
I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Matthew!
-MATT-
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
-LAURA-
I'm freaking out! Okay, I take it back, I take it back, I'm going to cast Dawn instead.
-SAM-
Dawn.
-LAURA-
Dawn.
Which is basically the same thing, but it's a different type of damage.
So I'm going to cast Dawn, which is a 30 foot radius, 40 foot high cylinder of bright light.
-MATT-
That's even bigger.
I don't have a template for that.
-LAURA-
Each creature in it must make a constitution saving throw.
-SAM-
"Consti-tyew-tion."
-MATT-
30 foot radius, so yeah, that'll be--
-SAM-
Each <i>enemy</i> creature, or each creature?
-MATT-
Each creature.
-LAURA-
Each creature, but I choose the location.
-MATT-
Correct, where are you putting it, within 60 feet of you?
-LIAM-
It's a pretty crowded deck.
-LAURA-
It is a pretty crowded deck.
-SAM-
Deck of many things, really.
-LAURA-
Is this a bad move, you guys?
-TRAVIS-
We're all back--
-MATT-
Just so you know, you can only let it hit anything over here, because you have no visibility to see across the ship right now.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So where do you want it to land?
-TRAVIS-
That's my fault, so.
We're all in this together.
-LAURA-
In front of--
-MARISHA-
You're having a Keyleth moment.
I'm so proud of you.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
In front of the--
-MARISHA-
Thanks, Fjord.
-LAURA-
The door, in front of the door? (squeaking) Is it going to hit me?
-MATT-
Where are you casting, then? (laughter)
-LIAM-
I cast haste on Laura.
-LAURA-
No.
(laughter) (muffled) Okay, I changed my mind again! (laughing) Spiritual Guardians, and then I swear Matt, this is the last thing, I'm going to do Spiritual Guardians.
-MATT-
Spiritual Guardians, okay.
-LAURA-
But I'm going to cast it at fifth level.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
So many different props.
-MATT-
I know.
-TRAVIS-
Jester just scrolls through her spells, like-- (scrolling sounds)
-MATT-
So 15 feet?
-MARISHA-
No, shit, not that-- no!
-LAURA-
Okay, so this is a 15 feet radius around me.
I'm just trying to see how many circles you have.
-MATT-
Apparently, we're going through it-- there we go.
-LAURA-
Okay, so these only attack creatures that I choose?
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
That are within 15 feet of me.
-SAM-
But I'm going to choose everybody!
-LAURA-
I'm going to choose every motherfucker on this boat! Okay, so that is a 5d8 radiant damage.
-MATT-
For those who fail their wisdom save, right?
-LAURA-
It's a wisdom save, but it's a concentration, which means I lose my duplicate.
-MATT-
You do.
-LAURA-
On the other side.
-SAM-
Also Matt, I think as soon as I started to hold a spell, do I lose concentration on the other spell?
-MATT-
You do, yes.
-SAM-
So they're no longer encumbered, the lobster people.
-MATT-
Oh, that's right, they're no longer charmed.
-SAM-
Charmed.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
They are still baned, but they're no longer charmed, okay.
You got it.
So--
-LAURA-
Affected creatures are halved in the area.
-MATT-
Right, their speed is halved.
-LAURA-
And when they start their turn there, they have to make a save.
-MATT-
Gotcha.
-TALIESIN-
Or when they end it.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Which technically, when you cast it, is that entering the area?
-MATT-
No, entering is when they're actually stepping into the space, or at the start of their turn.
-TALIESIN-
Start of their turn.
-MATT-
Pardon me, all right, does that finish your turn?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Okay, finishes Jester's go.
Caduceus, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
It was a good plan.
-MATT-
It was.
-TALIESIN-
Laura, that was a good move, we're going to celebrate it.
-TRAVIS-
We're shitting our pants right now.
Everybody's shitting.
-MARISHA-
Plan's out the window.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardian at fourth level.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
That was what I was--
-TRAVIS-
How many circles you got, Matt?
-TALIESIN-
Got another circle?
-TRAVIS-
How many you got?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Thing's going to look like the fucking Olympics soon.
-MATT-
All right, Caduceus--
-LIAM-
We all thought this was a randomly--
-TALIESIN-
That also means Bane is gone.
-TRAVIS-
(singing Olympics theme)
-TALIESIN-
And I'm going to walk towards where I saw Fjord, because my whole plan was to give him some coverage with a big--
-LAURA-
Caduceus, yours looks like it's glowing.
-TALIESIN-
It is.
-SAM-
Remember when the Olympics existed?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
So I was going to walk, not even run, I was just going to take my gentle time making my way to where I thought Fjord was--
-MATT-
To where you think Fjord is?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
♪ Makin' my way to Fjord ♪
-MARISHA-
Old concept.
-LAURA-
♪ Walkin' slow ♪
-MARISHA-
Or yeah yeah yeah, old magic.
-ASHLEY-
♪ Makin' my way to Fjord ♪
-MATT-
So you walk up into this space there, and now you can see Fjord and you can see Avantika.
-TALIESIN-
Hey! Oh, God.
-LAURA-
And they both see lots of beetles.
-MATT-
Yes.
Now, within the fog, there's just, just this swirling cloud of celestial beetles that are just gathering around Caduceus.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what do the beetles mean? What happens if we walk into the beetles?
-TALIESIN-
Nothing, you're fine.
-LIAM-
We thought this was a randomly rolled--
-LAURA-
It's only enemies that get hurt by the beetles and by the dick unicorns.
-LIAM-
Thought this was off a table, one of you are just like, "Wait, he rolled a two so that means I've got this"--
-MATT-
There was a one-in-10 chance this encounter was going to happen.
-LIAM-
One in 10?!
-LAURA-
You rolled the one!
-TALIESIN-
Oh wow.
-ASHLEY-
Tuh-ravis!
-LIAM-
Woo!
-SAM-
He knew. Travis knew, he wanted this.
-TRAVIS-
Deep down, yeah.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Okay, so, Caduceus, you've used your action, you moved in there, you bump into Fjord, and Fjord, you can see, all of a sudden, the beetles are scattering in the space.
They're not hurting you, and right as Avantika stands up, the crystal in one hand, beginning to tuck it into her side pouch.
Caduceus approaches, too, and the beetles swarm around her.
She's like (growls) looking around, eyes glowing through the fog a little bit.
-MARISHA-
So you have eyes on her.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You do now.
-TALIESIN-
I do now, oh boy.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your turn?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I mean, yeah.
-MATT-
All right, that crew guy over there, who's currently trying to arm that ballista can't see what he's doing now, because the fog has filled the space, so he's going to take another turn to try and fiddle with it.
This guy over here, who's been freaking out, is going to finish loading the ballista with a heavy bolt, but that's his action to do so.
That finishes the crew's go. Now it comes to the other mage.
-SAM-
The other mage?
-LIAM-
Yeah, the guy on the back--
-TRAVIS-
The guy on the captain's wheel.
-SAM-
Oh God, I totally forgot about them.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, this is rough.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-SAM-
I hate the water.
-TALIESIN-
Everyone has an advantage on a saving throw by the way.
I should keep reminding people of that.
-LAURA-
Everybody?
-TALIESIN-
Except for you.
-MARISHA-
Because of Yasha's battle cry, and attacks--
-TALIESIN-
Attacks and saves.
-SAM-
Attacks and saves.
-LAURA-
That's important.
-MARISHA-
Where's the mage?
-LIAM-
On the back.
-LAURA-

-LIAM-
Yeah.

-ASHLEY-
We should give Matt the heat.
What are you doing, Matt? I'm just kidding.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That'll work well.
It's going to cast Witch Bolt at you, because everyone else is currently surrounded and clustered, and you just ran up and you're floating in the middle of the air, over the space, looking down.
Like recognizes like, and it's going to cast Witch Bolt at fifth level.
-SAM-
Game recognizes game--
-LIAM-
That's an attack roll, right?
-MATT-
It is.
-LIAM-
Okay, so it's got to hit me.
It does, yes.
Oh, that's a one.
-ASHLEY-
You have advan--

What'd you roll over there?

A one for hitting-- oh, you didn't even roll to hit.

Well, right, but that'll be the roll when it gets there.

That'll be the roll.

Natural 20.
-SAM-
Ooh!

I'm not even joking.
-LIAM-
I'll take it.

Roll a concentration check.
Anything less of a 20 on your advantage will cause you to lose concentration on Fly.
-LIAM-
Anything less of a 20?
-MATT-
Correct.
-LIAM-
For a con--
-LAURA-
Like, total 20?
-MATT-
Yeah, because it's half damage, so you have to beat a 32.
-TRAVIS-
I like your tee shirt, do it for the pong.
-LIAM-
11, four, five, nine is 20.
-MATT-
No, no, I mean a natural 20.
-LIAM-
Oh a natural 20?
-MATT-
Yeah. Sorry, the damage--
-LIAM-
What's the total?
-MATT-
32 is what you have to beat.
-LIAM-
Oh, because of how much damage it was? This is the first con-- yup, gone, down I go.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-SAM-
Wait.
-MATT-
You lose concentration and plummet 30 feet.
-SAM-
Oh, fly goes away?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
He lost concentration.
-SAM-
Oh no!
-LIAM-
I'll cast Feather Fall, though, as I'm falling.
-MATT-
Okay, as a reaction, which you can totally do.
So you do not take fall damage.
You drift down into the fog, and now have no visibility.
You land safely and don't take any additional fall damage, but as you touch down, you are surrounded in thick white sea fog, and have no idea where other folks are.
-TRAVIS-
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.
-SAM-
It's not a good fight.
-TRAVIS-
Going exactly how I thought it would.
-MARISHA-
(laughing) We had so many good plans.
-MATT-
Shift over there.
-LIAM-
Oh, man.
-MATT-
The captain's going to take a swing with this fist.
-SAM-
Captain Kem!
-TRAVIS-
Clock that motherfucker.
-MATT-
That does hit!
-LAURA-
(squishing)
-MATT-
It takes four points of damage.
(cheering)
-LAURA-
Fuck you, mahge.
(laughter)
-MATT-
All righty, Beauregard, it's your turn.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit, okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Please get over here, please get over here.
-MARISHA-
Okay okay okay okay.
I'm still grappled by douche lobster?
-SAM-
Wait, no, I thought that Yasha cut off his hand?
-MATT-
He's almost dead. He's just not quite--
-MARISHA-
It's almost dead.
-SAM-
She was aiming for the claw!
-ASHLEY-
I think I-- I think I added an extra seven by accident on the second hit.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, the first hit's the one-- got it.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
Mistake.
-LAURA-
So we got extra seven points.
-MARISHA-
But I still have an advantage on attack rolls.
-MATT-
You do. He's still stunned until the end of your turn.
-MARISHA-
And he's still stunned until the end of my turn.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Is he still stunned until the end of her turn?
-MATT-
He's actually still tunned.
Still tunned.
-SAM-
Still tunned.
-MARISHA-
Still tunned.
-MATT-
Still tunned.
-MARISHA-
What do I do here? Okay, okay.
-TALIESIN-
Gotta figure out what the fuck I'm doing next. I know it's going to change--
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's the thing.
I had all these things planned, and it is all--
-MARISHA-
I'm just going to try and-- I'm going to beat this guy's face and try and kill him so I can go away.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-MARISHA-
Pop pop.
Oh my god.
-MATT-
You have an advantage on these hits, because he's stunned, don't forget.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, right, right, right.
-MATT-
Well, that first roll will be the first attack.
-MARISHA-
Right, right, and then just do them all at once.
-ASHLEY-
You also have advantage on attack rolls.
-LIAM-
This is the best.
-MARISHA-
Right.
-TALIESIN-
Advantage on attack rolls.
-MARISHA-
These are all rough, 14 for the first one?
-MATT-
14 misses.
-MARISHA-
16 for the second one.
-MATT-
Just barely hits.
-MARISHA-
That's with advantage on both of them.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-TRAVIS-
Shit. Come on.
-MATT-
The first strike, as you're just like--
-MARISHA-
I rolled two fours--
-MATT-
-- smacking.
-MARISHA-
-- on the first attack and a two and a six on the second one.
-MATT-
That sucks.
Impacting against its outer shell. It's still resisting, but you do manage to push through with the next strike.
-MARISHA-
Wait, wait, wait. With my Belabor, 14, that's actually-- sorry, I was adding plus 10.
It's actually a 16 on the first attack and a 18 on the second one.
-MATT-
Then both would hit.
-MARISHA-
Because it's a plus 12 with the Belabor.
-MATT-
There you go.
-MARISHA-
That's my bad, I am really sorry.
-MATT-
That's okay, They both hit, then.
-MARISHA-
Thank you.
-MATT-
No worries.
-SAM-
Why are you so good at Dungeons &amp; Dragons? (laughter)
-MATT-
So the first hit?
-MARISHA-
Okay, the first hit is 13 damage.
-MATT-
13 damage, all righty.
-MARISHA-
(whispering) Let's get this motherfucker.
-MATT-
All right, you have a second hit.
-MARISHA-
Yes, and then the second hit is 12 damage.
-MATT-
12 damage.
The first strike, as you punk it in the middle of the face, you watch it (gurgling).
It pulls back and begins to gurgle a little bit.
You see where the armor that normally protects the part of the head is now caved in and exposed, and with the second strike you take the staff and jam it in like a utensil, like you're carving the flesh out of a lobster claw.
And as you put it inside, it immediately drops, releasing you.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go.
-MARISHA-
Thank god, okay.
-LAURA-
You guys, we're winning this fight.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
It's all turning around.
-SAM-
One of the enemies down.
-MARISHA-
Fuck.
-LAURA-
We killed a pawn, you guys!
-MATT-
You did it.
-TALIESIN-
How many player characters?
-TRAVIS-
We need your help! (pigeon cooing)
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
(high-pitched) Help me!
-MARISHA-
Step of the wind, step of the wind--
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
-- so I can disengage.
-TRAVIS-
I fucked up! (pigeon cooing)
-SAM-
I'm in a soup of my own making! (cooing)
-MARISHA-
And I'm going to go into the fog where I know that Fjord and Avantika are, and that's as far as I know.
-MATT-
Okay, you rush in, and the first thing you've bump into is Avantika.
-MARISHA-
(grunts)
-MATT-
Because you're not quite sure where anybody is, and the direction that you're traveling from, the staircase, you run into her.
-MARISHA-
Cinematically, that's super cool.
In reality, ho shit.
Okay.
That was my bonus action.
Action, bonus action.
-MATT-
You're good.
-MARISHA-
I moved and that's it.
-SAM-
It's an awkward meet?
-TRAVIS-
That's good.
-MATT-
You have more movement, if you want to try and--
-TRAVIS-
If she tries to leave, and you can hit her, she stays.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's true, that's true.
-LIAM-
Keep her rooted to the spot, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
That's what I needed.
-MARISHA-
That's all I got, that's all I got.
-TRAVIS-
Nobody can see in.
-LIAM-
No, that's gold.
-MARISHA-
So I'm just going to look at her and go: 'Sup? And then that's it.
-MATT-
Okay.
That finished your go. Fjord, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
Well, nothing like following one bad decision with another one, right?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Do it.
-TRAVIS-
I am going to cast Command at 5th-level, and say the word "drop."
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Because the target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
-LIAM-
Oh, that's a great move.
-TRAVIS-
With a wisdom save of 18.
-MATT-
Yeah, at 5th-level you can target other creatures, technically, within 60 feet.
-TRAVIS-
60 feet?
-MATT-
Yes.
Because a higher level doesn't make it harder for them; it just has more targets.
-TRAVIS-
Is that mage within 60 feet?
-LIAM-
The lobster holding Veth?
-MATT-
The mage is not, but the lobster that's holding onto--
-LIAM-
Lobster's holding Veth!
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one, that one, yeah, lobster holding Veth.
-MATT-
Okay.
So roll for the lobster first.
-SAM-
Do they need to understand or anything, or does it just work?
-MATT-
It magically-- the command goes through to their mind.
That is a 16. What's the spell DC?
-TRAVIS-
For Avantika?
-MATT-
No, for the lobster.
-TRAVIS-
It's 18 wisdom.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, so totally, he drops you.
You are no longer grappled.
-LAURA-
Yay!
-LAURA-
Her wisdom's higher, I think, than the lobster.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
I'm dying, I'm dying inside.
-MATT-
Avantika, with the wisdom bonus, is a 16.
-ALL-
(exclaiming)
-MATT-
So as she's putting the orb into her pocket, turns and looks over at Beauregard being bumped into, and then hears you just shout at her, "Drop it." And as she does, the eyes glaze over for a second and the orb just, (thudding, rolling) begins to roll from her feet.
-LAURA-
Is it rolling under Beau's feet?
-MATT-
It's just right in front of her.
So technically it's in the same space as her.
-TALIESIN-
You still have enough to grab it.
-MATT-
Well, that's your action is casting the spell.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Bonus action?
-TRAVIS-
I want to stay-- It's like right under her feet, right?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, and I'm right there, and Beau's right on the other side.
We're making a Avantika sandwich.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Right? Is that where we currently are? If that's not the case, I would like to make sure--
-MATT-
You're not at the moment.
If you want to try and squeeze past, you can to be full flanking.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that thing.
-MATT-
Okay, all right.
-TRAVIS-
I almost pulled my thumb out of socket.
-MATT-
Don't do that.
-TRAVIS-
It's all right, it usually goes back in.
-MATT-
There you go. The fog does move with you.
There we go.
All right, that finishes your turn?
-TRAVIS-
I think so, I think I chewed on the--
-TALIESIN-
Do you have to use an action to pick that up? Or is it a bonus action to pick that up?
-TRAVIS-
I don't have--
-LAURA-
Can you grab it with a bonus action?
-TRAVIS-
No, I don't think so.
-LAURA-
He investigated and he was able to grab it.
-TRAVIS-
That was her action.
-MATT-
That was her action to do that.
-LAURA-
But she investigated. Isn't investigating an action?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that was her action.
-MATT-
She used her action to look for it.
-LAURA-
And then she grabbed it.
-MATT-
Yes, she did.
-TALIESIN-
But she's blind and he's not.
-LAURA-
So you used your action to cast a spell, so then you could grab it with your bonus action?
-LIAM-
That was scrabbling-- well.
-MATT-
Her action was looking for it, and when she succeeded, so she found it.
-TALIESIN-
So the difference is whether or not it's because she's blind versus you, who are not, whether or not it's a--
-MATT-
Correct. I would say--
-TALIESIN-
Interesting differential because, yeah.
Oh my god.
-MATT-
There is--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, she spends her action to pick it up again.
-TRAVIS-
We can see, she can't.
-MATT-
Use object, pick up stuff.
-TRAVIS-
Now it just goes (impacts) and it's just cloud.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I just needed sentry.
-MATT-
Yeah. So picking up a weapon, picking up an object can be considered part of an action, generally, if it's on the ground.
Because you do not have a challenge to see this, as part of the action, I will allow you to pick it up if you want.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, really?! I will pick it up.
-MATT-
Because it would be the equivalent of picking up a dropped weapon that's in your space, which you can do as part of an attack action, or another action.
Because you are not encumbered by the sight within the fog, you can do that.
-TRAVIS-
Ah! (grunting)
-MATT-
What?!
-TRAVIS-
I'll just pick it up.
-MATT-
<i>That's</i> an action.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Lick it.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Okay. Okay, okay.
-MATT-
Okay.
So you now have the cloven crystal in your grasp.
That ends your turn, Fjord. Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Oh god, I don't know if I would jump in, since you guys left.
If I would stay here.
Okay, I'll keep fighting these things, because we're going to have to fight them at some point or another.
Okay.
I'm going to take an attack on lobster number one
-MATT-
Right there?
-ASHLEY-
Yup.
-MATT-
Okay, go for it. He's the one who still has you grappled.
So he's the one that's right in front of you.
-ASHLEY-
Right.
That would be...
15.
That doesn't hit, right?
-MATT-
15 does not hit.
-LAURA-
Did you take-- is it--
-MATT-
You still have advantage on your attacks.
-ASHLEY-
Even though it's on-- it ends--
-MATT-
It ends at the end of your next turn.
So you're still affected by your ability.
-ASHLEY-
That's worse! Okay.
So, uh, second attack.
Goddamn it. That is 14.
-MATT-
You still have advantage.
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit, shit, shit.
Okay, oh yeah, that hits, that hits, okay.
That's 27.
-MATT-
27 does hit. There you go.
-TRAVIS-
There's a lot happening.
There's a lot happening.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's all good.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to roll again, Savage Attacker, because that was shit.
Much better, much better.
Okay, so that would be...
30.
No, sorry. 20.
Sheesh louise.
-TALIESIN-
Pressure's high.
-MATT-
20 damage? Well, this is still your first hit, so you get all the damage that you normally would.
-ASHLEY-
No, that was my-- because the first hit--
-MATT-
The first time you hit, you get all the bonuses of your subclass.
So even if you miss the first strike, all that carries on to the next attack--
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
Let me roll another one, another--
-MATT-
So 20 plus seven plus whatever that is.
-ASHLEY-
So that would be...
25 total.
-MATT-
25-- did you roll a five there?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-MATT-
Then plus seven from your--
-ASHLEY-
From the radiant-- oh my god.
-MATT-
So it's 32 points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Dude.
-MATT-
There you go.
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
There you go.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go.
-MATT-
So with one swipe, the first one skids off of its armor.
As it's holding you, you bring your blade down and jam it into its back, and it carves in about a foot and a half and you wedge in pull it out with an arc spray of purple viscera.
It took a hefty chunk of it in one hit.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
That was pretty nice.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
You're still grappled, however.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, um-- That's all I can do.
-MATT-
Okay, that finishes your turn, Yasha.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that finishes my turn.
-MATT-
All right, it is now Avantika's turn.
-TRAVIS-
Oh god.
-LAURA-
But she's commanded--
-MATT-
At the front of her turn-- the fart? At the start of her turn-- (laughter)
She farts at the start of her turn.
She does have to make a saving throw against your--
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Which she rolls a-- 21, so she succeeds, so she takes half damage.
So go ahead and roll.
-TALIESIN-
So after half, that's six radiant damage.
-MATT-
Six radiant damage to Avantika.
-TALIESIN-
Does it seem like it's hurting her?
-MATT-
She's taking damage, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
But she doesn't look like-- is she undead taking radiant damage kind of damage, or?
-MATT-
It doesn't seem to be effecting her any more than you would expect.
-TALIESIN-
Expect her to be undead, all right.
-MATT-
Not all undead are vulnerable to radiant.
-TALIESIN-
Boo. All right, and she's slowed so she moves at half speed right now.
-MATT-
Half speed, you got it.
So she, as she realizes what happened, goes, "Oh, you've gotten very tricky since last we met, honey." Before she goes for the rapier, which is now hanging at the edge of her belt, she glances over at you, Beauregard, and then even slowed, is going to try and dodge around the side.
You do get an attack on her, if you want to.
-MARISHA-
Sentinel.
-MATT-
Sentinel. Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
I thought in the description of Command, it says the target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
-MATT-
"Must succeed a wisdom save or follow the command on its next turn." That's an interesting point of order.
So technically it wouldn't have dropped the orb until this turn.
-TRAVIS-
Got it, okay.
-SAM-
So you don't have it?
-TRAVIS-
It's on the ground.
-MATT-
Correct. So now it's on the ground.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-SAM-
But she doesn't get an action.
-MATT-
She doesn't get an action.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Been a while since we've done the Command spell.
-TRAVIS-
Totally.
-MARISHA-
So.
-TRAVIS-
It's kind of good and kind of bad.
-MATT-
So she uses her action to drop the orb and it's there on the ground.
-MARISHA-
Is she still trying to bolt? Now what is she doing?
-MATT-
Right now? No, she's going to stay put. It's right at her feet and she's just at a "come at me" type positioning.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
She's gauging everyone.
She can vaguely see shapes to the right and left and in front of her, so she's going to hold her position and put her feet over where the orb currently is, and is preparing to go for it next chance she gets. So.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Does kind of waste her turn.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-SAM-
She knows where it is, too.
-MATT-
So that's her turn.
She just ends it there.
-TRAVIS-
It's right between her feet, right? Like, she just dropped it.
-MATT-
On the ground.
It's rolled a little bit.
-TRAVIS-
That's fine.
-MATT-
That ends-- fuck, that fucks up her turn.
Top of its turn, the other creature is going to and go ahead and make a save against you.
Which-- it rolls a natural 20, so it makes it save. But go ahead and-- so it takes half damage to your Spiritual Guardians.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Where's my other? Okay.
Ooh! 28 points of radiant damage on that.
-MATT-
Nice.
So it takes 14 points of radiant damage.
Oh, that's the wrong one. There we go.
14. (unhappy gurgling) It's going to go ahead and immediately lash into you out of anger and frustration at the damage.
-LAURA-
The little froggy guy?
-MATT-
Yep.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Because he's right there next to you.
First strike is going to be...
21 to hit.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right, so you take 14 points of slashing damage.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Second strike is going to be 26 to hit.
-LAURA-
Wow, okay.
-MATT-
That's going to be 13 points of slashing damage.
-LAURA-
Cool.
-MATT-
And constitution-- Constitution checks on each of these.
You just have to beat a 10.
With advantage.
-LAURA-
Okay, that works.
-MATT-
There are constitution saving throws.
-LAURA-
Both of them save.
-MATT-
Okay, third one.
That's cocked, actually.
That's going to be another 21.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
That one you take 17 points of slashing damage.
Go ahead and make another attack with the advantage-- or another constitution saving throw with advantage .
-TRAVIS-
This is all from that big fucker?
-LAURA-
The little frog!
-MATT-
The little frog thing.
-TRAVIS-
Goddamn, that thing's a monster.
-MATT-
Mind you, it's still nine feet and wide as fuck.
-LAURA-
He's not a little frog, he's a big scary frog.
That's-- I save.
-MATT-
And as soon as it finishes that, it vanishes from behind you.
-LAURA-
Wait, before-- during that, could I have use reaction on him before he did?
-MATT-
You can use a reaction in the middle of it, yeah.
-LAURA-
Can I say I did my Hellish Rebuke on him?
-MATT-
Yeah, you can. Yes, you can indeed.
So he has to make a constitution saving throw against you, or reflex?
-LAURA-
I don't know?! Hold on, let me--! Where's my Hellish Rebuke?! Where's the spell? Oh, there it is. Okay.
It's a dexterity.
-MATT-
Dexterity. 16.
-LAURA-
He saves.
-MATT-
So he takes half damage.
-LAURA-
Half damage, 3d10.
-MATT-
And is going to (poofing) right back over next to Caleb, who has just faintly landed on the outskirts the fog.
-LAURA-
So he took eight points, so it was a 16.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right, that finishes its go.
Now, the rest of the crab creatures're going to go.
The one that's still in front of you is going to go ahead and take a wisdom save.
And it's going to fail, so roll damage for the--
-LAURA-
I roll again or he just takes the same damage that I rolled before?
-MATT-
We can do either. I mean, like.
I will say, because it's a different initiative turn, go ahead and roll damage.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
My mind's going in, like, seven directions.
If this happens, then this.
If this happens, then this.
-TRAVIS-
Branching narrative going on here.
-LAURA-
22.
-MATT-
22, nice.
It gets sparked from the floating around massive swarm of celestial unicorn hamsters, and then shifts its way across the ship here to try and shore up its positioning against Veth and is going to attack Veth twice.
First strike, it's cocked.
Oh, that's a real bad one.
That's 11.
-SAM-
Hey, that misses.
-TRAVIS-
Real bad.
-MATT-
Yep, and that's going to be a 17 to hit.
-SAM-
Misses!
-MATT-
Both giant pincers swings.
You duck out of the way and then tumble roll and catch yourself on the ground, no impact on you.
That finishes its go.
This one, it has you grappled, Yasha, it's going to go ahead and strike at you twice.
The first one is a natural 20.
-ASHLEY-
That definitely hits.
-TALIESIN-
I am not within range. Nope.
-MATT-
Unfortunately.
-TALIESIN-
Am I?
-MATT-
Within 30 feet? You are not.
-ASHLEY-
I'm also raging, so.
-MATT-
You are, so you'll just take half damage, which is good.
So you take on that one...
18 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half, so nine.
And the second attack is going to be a nine.
So yeah.
-SAM-
Oh great.
-MATT-
The first, its other pincer goes to grab towards you and you duck out of the way as it closes its other one, that's still holding it even tighter around you and squeezes and fills you with pain as it does tentacles unfurl from under its armor and making the latch up your body.
Make constitution saving throw for me, please.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, okay.
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, come on!
-MATT-
No effect from the poison.
-MARISHA-
Woo!
-MATT-
This guy here is going to--
-ASHLEY-
I haven't rolled one of those...
-MATT-
Chitter down into the fog and begin to push its way towards Caduceus, whatever it runs into in this space and the first thing that comes into is Caduceus.
-TALIESIN-
So immediately upon entering the field, it takes damage.
-MATT-
It does.
-TALIESIN-
Before it even gets anywhere near me and then it also gets its movement halved for 15 feet.
-MATT-
Correct, so at-- it can't quite get to you.
-TALIESIN-
Nope, can't.
So let's take some damage.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Do a save, I guess.
-MATT-
It's just out of the range to get to actually attack you.
Oh, but it has a reach of 10 with its pincers, so, no, it is in range.
-TALIESIN-
Well, first to take some damage, anyway.
-MATT-
Indeed.
So it's a natural one on its save.
So it takes full damage.
-TALIESIN-
That's, six, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14.
-LAURA-
Do your beetles do more damage than my hamsters?
-TRAVIS-
Go Bears.
-SAM-
Maybe it's just as bad.
-LIAM-
Puppy Bowl.
-TALIESIN-
One, hold on one second, sorry, sorry, just doing math.
-MARISHA-
So cute.
-SAM-
Use D&amp;D Beyond's rolling feature!
-TALIESIN-
Fuck off.
(laughter)
21 points of radiant damage.
-MATT-
Okay, nice.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, sir.
-LAURA-
Just barely.
But he did cast it at a 4th-level.
-MATT-
So is that blasts across, and this one's looking pretty dang hurt at this point. It's like (gurgling).
It's going ahead and swing twice at you with its pincers.
The first one. They have disadvantage on each because they're in the fog and you are technically partially obscured.
It's just swinging at a shape in the fog.
Natural one.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, in that case, it misses me with an attack, so I'm going to use my reaction to blast them with arcane force.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
That's-- let's see.
10.
20 points of force damage.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
Whoa.
-MATT-
Here. Because right now-- Fjord moved away from next to you, so your visibility has faded in the fog.
You felt something swing towards you, go ahead and--
-TALIESIN-
The shield just has a reaction, so.
-MATT-
No, I understand. This is me trying to see if you're able to actually aim it in the right direction from something, without knowing something's there.
So just roll a perception check for me.
You're super easy at that.
-TALIESIN-
I don't have any advantage on that, do I?
-MATT-
You have disadvantage on it, because you're in heavy-- you're obscured fog, but you don't have to roll super high.
-SAM-
Fucking fog.
-TALIESIN-
Thank god, because I-- No, never mind. That's good. 25.
-MATT-
Yeah, you're fine. So go ahead.
That's 20 damage, you said?
-TALIESIN-
20 damage and then make a strength saving throw, if you're still alive.
-MATT-
It doesn't need to.
As you turn this way, the shield blasts off this burst of arcane force damage, and you watch as faint shadows of something just disappears.
The rest of you see, firing out of the fog, a rain of calamari chunks.
(laughter) Just scatters on the side of the ship.
-MARISHA-
We're going to eat good tonight.
-TALIESIN-
Yasha, was that you? Oh, sorry! (laughter)
-MATT-
Well done.
-TRAVIS-
I'll fix it, I'll fix it.
-MATT-
All right, that's going to finish their go.
Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.
-SAM-
Good gravy.
I've got two giant lobsters behind me, right? And there's a big cloud fog thing.
Still have advantage on my attack from Yasha, right?
-TALIESIN-
No.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-SAM-
What?!
-ASHLEY-
Ends at my turn.
-SAM-
You poopy head.
-ASHLEY-
Well, you know, I do what I can.
-SAM-
How do I?
-TRAVIS-
♪ How do I ♪
-LAURA-
You're not grappled anymore.
-SAM-
I know, but I can't do sneak attack unless the one that's engaged with me is engaged with somebody else.
Are they? No.
-LAURA-
Can't you run away from it?
-SAM-
Sure.
-LAURA-
Run away from it.
-SAM-
Into the fog.
-LAURA-
Stop talking.
-SAM-
Then I can't see anyone.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you can if you stand by Fjord.
-SAM-
I don't know where Fjord is.
-MARISHA-
Run into the fog and find out.
-TRAVIS-
(pigeon coo) Help me! (pigeon coo) All the regrets!
-SAM-
What? Oh shit.
So no lobsters near me are engaged.
And is anyone I can see engaged with somebody else?
-MATT-
At the moment, there is the weird, toad demon creature that is harrying the shape of a person in the fog, yes.
Oh, by the way, Beauregard, I forgot to mention because you did get one attack on Avantika, you do take 25 points of cold damage.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what, why, what?
-TRAVIS-
25 points of cold damage?
-LAURA-
Because she's got the fucking armor.
-MATT-
That icy--
-TRAVIS-
Agathys.
-MATT-
Armor of Agathys that is currently protecting her.
So just--
-MARISHA-
25 points of cold?
-MATT-
Yeah, so mark that down.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I take back what I just told you.
Now it's different.
-SAM-
All right, if I see that thing is engaged with someone, I will attack it.
-TRAVIS-
That was the max.
-MATT-
I'll say, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-SAM-
Yeah?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
I will, bonus action, charge up my Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.
-MATT-
You got it.
-SAM-
And then I will-- Wait, that's my 3rd-level spell. That's okay.
And then I will shoot aiming...
True.
No!
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Rogue natural ability or whatever!
-SAM-
15?
-LIAM-
Doesn't affect attack rolls.
-MATT-
15 does not hit.
-SAM-
Argh!
-ASHLEY-
No!
-MATT-
(sizzling) (firing) (air whooshing) Off into the ocean.
You watch as this distant flare of a spark just disappears into the storm in the distance.
-SAM-
And then I will use my movement to run into the fog.
You, Matthew Mercer, get to pick where you think I would go, because I haven't seen anyone in there for a while.
I'm just trying to find action.
-LAURA-
Would you've Fjord yell, "Drop it"?
-MATT-
Roll a d4.
-MARISHA-
♪ Into the unknown! ♪
-MATT-
One, two, three, four.
That's the arc spread them on there.
-SAM-
Two.
-MATT-
Two.
All right, you run into the fog, charging around the side and head, bumping right in between Fjord and Caduceus.
-SAM-
Oh, so I can see them?
-MATT-
You can see them, yes.
And you can see Avantika.
-SAM-
Cool.
-MARISHA-
Wait, can he see Beau, too?
-MATT-
No.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Oh wait. Isn't she--
-MARISHA-
I heard Nott.
-TALIESIN-
-- sharing an edge with Fjord?
-MATT-
Actually, yeah, because you see through the fog entirely.
So yeah. So you can see Beauregard.
However, there's an attack of opportunity against you from the creature, and if it does hit, that'll change this because it will grapple you.
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-TRAVIS-
Doesn't it roll with-- Oh, no.
-MATT-
It does roll a 12 to hit, so you duck out of the way, dart past into the fog.
You are snow blind for a second and then all of a sudden everything clarifies and it's just a faint layer of gray around everything.
You can clearly see everything in the cloud around you, including Avantika standing between the group of you with the orb on the ground right there.
Does that finish your turn?
-SAM-
Yep, that's it.
-TALIESIN-
Have you taken damage?
-MATT-
All right. Caleb, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Oh, I am in the kill box and low on HP and I don't want anyone to have to worry about healing me, so from out of the fog a T-rex lumbers up--
-TRAVIS-
Yes! Let it go, baby!
-LIAM-
-- out of the fog!
-TRAVIS-
Let's go!
-LAURA-
Yes, and he has a T-rex!
-MARISHA-
What is this?
-LAURA-
T-rex fight on a boat!
-LIAM-
Turn me around, Matt. Face me the other way.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck your D&amp;D game!
-LIAM-
Swivel me around the other way, sir.
-MATT-
The other way?
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
(laughter)
This fight is everything!
-MATT-
There you go.
-LIAM-
(like Stefon from SNL) This boat has everything.
(laughter)
And with my move, because that's my action.
So with my-- because I can't attack, right? Because casting Polymorph just gets me there.
So with my movement, I am going to lumber and squeeze. Use my 50 feet of movement to bully my way towards the center so I can get my face right into the fish mage's face, if possible, between the stairs.
-MATT-
So you're going to attempt to step over.
Unfortunately, this guy is blocking your movement.
-LIAM-
Which guy, lobster guy?
-MATT-
The lobster guy, yeah.
-LIAM-
That doesn't become just difficult terrain for my massive miniature?
-MATT-
If it's a mini-- if it was a medium-sized creature, I'd say yes.
He's large enough to be an issue.
-LIAM-
What if I absolutely destroyed the ballista behind me to get there?
-SAM-
You'd have to use an attack to--
-LIAM-
I'll stomp on it.
-MATT-
You know what? Go ahead and make a strength check.
-MARISHA-
This is officially an Asylum film.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-LIAM-
That's a 20.
-MATT-
20, that beats an 18.
So yeah, I'll say you do manage to step on it and push over to get to where you're wanting to go.
-LIAM-
(yells)
-MARISHA-
Arctic-Rex 24!
-MATT-
You stomp over and--
-LIAM-
And if you'll allow, the whole point is to get my big toothy maw, breathing hot air in the mage's face.
-MATT-
Certainly.
-LIAM-
(low growling breaths)
-TRAVIS-
So good, dude. So! Good!
-MATT-
Sure, there we go.
There we go. D&amp;D.
-LIAM-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
♪ It's D&amp;D! ♪
-SAM-
That looks like a bunch of toys from my son's toy drawer.
-MATT-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
This is amazing.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
(like a movie trailer) The killer lobster--
-MATT-
So as all of you are there in the middle of the fog, all staring at Avantika in this standoff moment, looking at each other, you suddenly hear (roars).
You all glance over into the corner of the fog: there's a T-rex on your boat, in the middle of the arctic ocean, the Frigid Depths.
As he just walks away (stomping footsteps).
You do get an attack of opportunity from the crustacean as you move past.
That is a...
15 to hit?
-LIAM-
It hits.
-MATT-
All right. That does, however, hold you back because you are grappled by it from the--
-LIAM-
Doesn't he have Veth in it? Oh, no, he missed her, right?
-SAM-
I scrambled away.
-MATT-
You do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, and you're not quite to your quarry because you're being held back by a giant piece of calamari.
-LIAM-
Am I 10 feet away?
-MATT-
You are.
So yes, you are in range.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
That T-rex is coming down.
-TRAVIS-
That is so Jurassic Park 2.
-MATT-
Oh, it'll be fine, what are you talking about? It's going to be great.
It's going to last forever, you guys.
(laughter)
-SAM-
I want Jester to polymorph--
-LAURA-
T-rex is going to take out the whole map.
-MATT-
This is a great--
-ASHLEY-
Oh! Oh!
-SAM-
I want you to polymorph into a Lego guy--
-TRAVIS-
It's moving!
-SAM-
-- or, like, a matchbox car just so we can make this map even weirder.
-LIAM-
Hold me up, barbarian dude.
-MATT-
Let's go ahead and close that door there.
-ASHLEY-
He was trying so hard to hold on.
-TRAVIS-
We've got an open door.
This ship is awesome.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
There we go.
Sure.
-LAURA-
Ah!
-MATT-
Fuck all y'all, it's fine.
-LAURA-
It's going to work.
-MATT-
Thanks for making a T-rex on a boat, Liam! Goddamn it.
-SAM-
Oh no!
-LIAM-
Hey, man, you Witch Bolted me so hard.
-MATT-
I did, I did. Not my fault; enemies did it.
All right. Sure, sure. It's fine.
(cheering)
-LIAM-
Another circle for the Olympics.
-MATT-
We'll leave it how it went.
You're in range, you're a T-rex, you can hit him, it's fine.
-SAM-
One more circle, guys.
We can do this.
-LIAM-
Someone put down in the area of effect spell.
-ASHLEY-
Oh no, it's falling again.
-ASHLEY-
I love how he was like--
-MATT-
I'm just going to chuck you in the ocean, man.
All right, that finish your turn, Caleb?!
-LIAM-
(laughing) Yes.
-MATT-
Okay.
Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.
-LAURA-
I'm going to--
-TRAVIS-
I love it. Such a good session.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
I'm going to run down.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I love this game.
-TRAVIS-
I know!
-LAURA-
There's still another lobster up by Yasha.
-MATT-
Correct. There are two on the deck.
-LAURA-
I'm going to use my spiritual weapon to attack the lobster.
-MATT-
Go for it.
It moves over and is easily within range.
-LAURA-
That's a natural one.
-MATT-
That misses.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Big whiff.
-LAURA-
I'm going to run into the fog.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
♪ Into the unknown ♪
-MATT-
Roll a d4 for me.
-MARISHA-
♪ Into the unknown ♪
-LAURA-
Three?
-MATT-
Okay. You run into Caduceus.
-LAURA-
Oh! Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Ah, again, everybody.
-MATT-
You are still blinded.
You do not see anything in the space.
-SAM-
Does she see Caduceus or smell his musk?
-MATT-
At your passive perception? Not quite.
-LAURA-
And that's as far as I can get?
-MATT-
That's far as you can get.
You are blocked between the ballista and your friends.
You can try and push through your friends if you want to, but you're moving-- Oh, I guess. Well, what do you want to do?
-LAURA-
If I can shout and try to walk as far as I can.
-MATT-
Actually, no, that's as far as you can get because you can only move five more feet and those two spaces next to you are occupied by friends.
So you either move to the left or right, but you can't move forward any more.
-LAURA-
Okay.
Then--
-ASHLEY-
How close do you have to be to be able to see in the fog?
-LAURA-
I can't really--
-SAM-
Right next to.
-LAURA-
Is my spiritual guardians, are they at least protecting? Do they still count as protecting everything within 15 feet of me, if I can't see the things?
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Yes?
-MATT-
Yeah. They're still hitting things around you.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
You're just not focusing on them.
-SAM-
Audience can't see any of these minis either.
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
Hey.
You guys are throwing shit down to obscure the battlefield, not my fault.
Sorry.
-LAURA-
Dang it, I had wanted to heal, for the first time ever.
-SAM-
But you forgot?
-LAURA-
No, I just can't see anybody.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that's my fault.
-LIAM-
Really, it's just like (inaudible) at the Olympics.
-SAM-
That's right.
-TRAVIS-
Went a lot differently in my head.
-LIAM-
Oh yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Did you think that any of your friends could see in there no matter what?
-TRAVIS-
No, I just thought I would meet somebody over there.
-LIAM-
Oh man, I was like, going to be back to back with Fjord, knocking spells out of the air. Here we go.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, I kind of got there.
-LAURA-
I'm going to hold an attack until I can see something, I'm going to hold a spell until I can see an enemy.
Do I have to clarify which enemy?
-MATT-
You have to clarify what spell you're casting, and you're just saying until you see an enemy?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Okay, you got it.
-LAURA-
I'm going to hold Guiding Bolt until I can see an enemy.
-MATT-
You got it.
-MARISHA-
Until you can sea anemone.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Well done.
-LIAM-
Crawl up the side of the deck.
-MATT-
Does that finish your turn? Okay.
-MARISHA-
Here it comes!
-LAURA-
I'm worthless.
-MATT-
Jester hits at the end. Caduceus, you're up.
-MARISHA-
I swear it's coming.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to crawl my way over to where I saw Fjord move, very slowly, so I can tap him for some view, so I can see shit.
-MATT-
You would have to move into range.
You could move in and square in.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, try to get behind him.
-MATT-
Or are you going to scoot off to the side?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So you can move around over here to get to get within five feet of him to see the space.
-TALIESIN-
That's perfect.
-MATT-
There you go.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Now I'm--
-MATT-
My god. You fuckers with all of your--
-TALIESIN-
And she's still within my 15 feet, right?
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
Then I'm going to cast-- where did it go?
-LAURA-
Is she within my 15 feet?
-MATT-
Yep.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast--
-MATT-
Your overlapping guardians. (fluttering)
-LAURA-
I like to imagine that a couple of the beetles have climbed on top of some of my flying unicorns, are holding onto them.
-MARISHA-
Riding them?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds to try and get everybody who needs it into the 30-foot circle.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
So you can use my current 30-foot circle.
I'm going to try and get Beau, I don't know if I can get Jester, I'm going to try.
-MATT-
Which spell are you doing?
-TALIESIN-
Mass Cure Wounds.
-LAURA-
I'm right next you.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, but I drop a point to make a 30-foot radius thing.
-LAURA-
Oh, I see.
-MATT-
So this will drop your spiritual guardians, then?
-TALIESIN-
No, it's not concentration.
-MATT-
Wait, Mass Cure Wounds is instantaneous.
I was making sure it wasn't a concentration thing.
-TALIESIN-
No, no, no.
-MATT-
Okay, cool.
That's what I thought.
-TALIESIN-
So it's a 30-foot.
Yeah.
Up to six creatures and 30-foot radius sphere centered on any point within 60 feet.
So I'm going to try and get Beau and Jester and see if I can get--
-MATT-
You can get everybody in this space here without a problem.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
So that's 5th-level.
-MATT-
That's everybody except for Yasha.
-SAM-
Yeah, but he can't see where anyone is.
-MATT-
Everybody except Yasha and Caleb's T-rex.
I was like, "Where's Caleb's mini? Oh, right."
-LIAM-
C-Rex!
-TALIESIN-
Everybody gets-- that's okay.
20 points, everybody gets 20 points.
-MARISHA-
That's great.
-MATT-
Nice.
-LAURA-
That's great.
-TALIESIN-
And then-- yeah.
And I'm good.
That's my-- I don't really have a bonus action or anything to-- I don't think I have any bonus actions that are really that interesting.
No.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
No, that's what's I got.
-MATT-
That finishes your turn?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right.
-TALIESIN-
So you got 20. You got 20.
-MATT-
This crew here is now going to try and turn the ballista to fire upon this crab creature, rotating around. There's too much there.
I'm just going to say it's facing them. It's fine.
No, that is a 12. That shoots past.
This bolt, as it's about to fire, the runes in the front go, (magical whooshing) and you watch as energy begins to arc through this large metal arrow-like bolt.
And as he releases it, it bolts fast with an impossible amount of force and speed and it's just a little bit too wide, but it seems to go straight for an extended distance.
These are some powerful ballista.
-LAURA-
Good to know.
-MATT-
So.
-TRAVIS-
How did you miss? No, I'm just kidding.
-MATT-
Because the creature was grabbing onto the front of it and wrestling with it. He's like (screaming).
-TALIESIN-
You might have three creatures in your-- by the way.
-MATT-
All righty.
That's going to finish their go. That one over there, can't see where to aim and is currently holding on looking for something to aim towards, but is currently stuck in the fog cloud.
That brings us to the mage up here who's next to you.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
That's maj.
-MATT-
The T-rex is a problem.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
That's a meme.
-MATT-
But--
-MARISHA-
The T-rex is a problem.
-TRAVIS-
T-rex is a problem.
-MATT-
But it does have priorities and it is an intelligent creature.
So it's going to still stay within your range and move over to this side and is going to cast Dispel Magic on the fog cloud, which vanishes.
-SAM-
Thank god.
-TRAVIS-
I didn't think it could be the dispelled.
-MATT-
Any magical effect can be dispelled if it's targeted directly and unless it states otherwise.
-TALIESIN-
Weren't you holding an attack?
-MATT-
Now you can see things.
-LAURA-
I was until I could see!
-MATT-
You can see. Who are you going after?
-LAURA-
Avantika!
-MATT-
Go for it, roll an attack.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
"Cannot be dispersed." That's fine.
-LAURA-
Okay. So that's an attack roll.
-TRAVIS-
Dispersed. I'm not going to argue with him! I think dispersed by natural means.
-LAURA-
20.
-MATT-
20 misses.
-SAM-
Like wind.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As you're holding the bolt and you unleash it, Avantika-- you let it go, and you're sure it would hit, and as soon as your vision clarifies, she's already dodged to the side and it just moves by.
-LAURA-
She's really hard to hit.
-SAM-
She wasn't for Fjord.
-ALL-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Wait.
Oh.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what'd you roll?
-LAURA-
20.
-MARISHA-
And you missed?
-MATT-
And is just going to stay within your combat range.
It's going to finish his movement over here, still within your 10-foot reach of your maw.
But it's now maneuvering between you and the battlefield below and is trying to keep concentrated in two spaces.
That's going to mark that spell there.
All righty.
Now it is Beauregard's turn. Fjord, you're on deck.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Okay.
Where's the crystal?
-MATT-
It's in Avantika's space.
-TRAVIS-
Between her feet.
-MATT-
Yes.
-SAM-
It's like--
-TRAVIS-
Right next to you.
-SAM-
Right on it.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
No, I'm just trying to think of what's the right move here.
If I go for it, is it going to be a contested dex roll or something?
-MATT-
It would be. She's protecting it.
It's not in your space.
If an object is in your space, you can pick it up with a movement, but because the drop spell dropped it in her space, she's defending it.
It would be a contested element here.
-LIAM-
Oh, let's go, ninja.
-SAM-
If you're reaching between her legs, Henry Crabgrass would like a word with you-- (laughter)
-- about consent.
-MARISHA-
The consent grass, yeah.
-MATT-
(as Henry) "Just make sure you check in with her first." (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
I'm not going to waste any actions or doing-- I'm going to just go for it, I'm going for it.
-LIAM-
Get that football.
-MATT-
Going for--?
-MARISHA-
The crystal.
-MATT-
Okay. So you're using your action to attempt to grab the crystal. All right.
So this would be a contested...
We'll say a contested athletics or acrobatics.
-LIAM-
Oh yeah.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LIAM-
Come on, jock.
-MARISHA-
Do I have any advantage?
-TRAVIS-
Which one you taken?
-MATT-
There is no advantage.
-MARISHA-
Both are the same.
Both are the same, so I'm going to say acrobatics, as I try to.
-MATT-
This is you both trying to maneuver through and her to try and deflect you and go for it herself.
-LIAM-
Hacky sack it into your hands, dude.
-MARISHA-
Lucky jade, lucky jade dice.
-TRAVIS-
He already rolled.
-LIAM-
Come on, come on.
-MARISHA-
He already rolled?
-LIAM-
Come on, come on.
-MARISHA-
20 total.
-MATT-
28.
-ALL-
Oh!
-MATT-
Rolled a natural 16. She's real quick.
-LIAM-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
So what does that mean?
-MATT-
It means you try and reach for it, and she kicks it out of your grasp and you try and go for it again, and she blocks the way and knocks you off to the side and kicks it back like a soccer player-- or football for our non-US friends-- player keeping the ball and guarding it through its legs.
-LIAM-
<i>Allez, allez, allez, allez.</i>
-TRAVIS-
With all of that dribbling, does she manage to keep it within her space?
-MATT-
She keeps within her own space, but it is a failed grasp.
You still have your bonus action and your move.
-LIAM-
I was sure you had that. Goddamn.
-MARISHA-
Fuck.
-TALIESIN-
I mean.
-MARISHA-
Goddamn it.
-TRAVIS-
Can you put your finger right above where Avantika is?
-MATT-
See that purple thing?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
That's her.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
(as Henry) You should've asked.
-MARISHA-
All right. Well. Well. All right.
-MATT-
It was like damn good try. The dice weren't with it, but that was a good try.
-MARISHA-
I didn't roll great. Okay.
I might as well Flurry of Blows her and see if I can stun her.
-MATT-
You can only Flurry of Blows if use your attack action.
But you can do it--
-MARISHA-
Patient Defense!
-MATT-
Okay, Patient Defense, you got it.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Damn it!
-LIAM-
Grandma Patient Defense.
-MATT-
(like an old woman) Come at me! All right, that finishes Beau's go.
Fjord, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
-TRAVIS-
So is she effectively against the side of the ship?
-MATT-
Yeah, you're all up against the edge of the ship and you and Beauregard are on one side and the rest of your friends are off to the edge.
-TRAVIS-
So if I stayed in her melee range and rotated around, could I get on-- could I put myself in front of her with the side of the ship and the ocean beyond it?
-MATT-
You could, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to try and do that.
-MATT-
Okay.
So you're going to maneuver through Veth to get on that end?
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I'm just going to double check this.
My dexterity is balls.
It just sucks.
-TALIESIN-
Athletics if you want to try a different stat--
-TRAVIS-
Athletics for a different--
-TALIESIN-
Strength contest versus dex.
-MATT-
Depends on what you're trying to do, buddy.
-TRAVIS-
If I wanted to shove her off of the ship, off the side, would that be strength or athletics?
-MATT-
That would be your, I'd say for this, it would be your athletics.
-TRAVIS-
All right. I'm going to try and shove her off of the ship.
-MATT-
You got it. Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Because either way, it's the same as trying to grab it.
-MATT-
Go ahead and make your athletics check.
-TRAVIS-
I don't have advantage on this, right?
-MATT-
No.
-TRAVIS-
No.
Just thought I'd check.
-LAURA-
No!
-TRAVIS-
11.
-MATT-
11.
This would be 22.
So as you attempted to shove into her with your shoulder to push her off the side, she, like, puts her hand on the side and judo spins you out of the way.
And you find yourself almost about to topple off the ship yourself with the momentum.
And she's preparing to go ahead and kick the back of your chest and put you over, and you catch it and maneuver back into space you were, and you both are back in this standoff.
-TRAVIS-
Wow, wow, wow, wow. That was terrible.
-MATT-
Once again, it's a game of chance.
With a good roll, that would've really fucked her up.
-TRAVIS-
You're totally right.
-MATT-
I love it, I love the risk.
-TRAVIS-
Bonus action, bonus action, bonus action.
There's just not much to do.
I think that's the rest of my-- I'll-- I will use the rest of my movement to put myself back in a flanking position with Beau on the opposite side of her.
Nope. I'm going to stay there.
-MATT-
You're going to stay there?
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to stay there. Yeah.
Just in case she tries to fucking pull me into the sea.
-MATT-
All right, Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I'm still fighting this thing.
So is Jester's spiritual weapon still there?
-LAURA-
It is.
-ASHLEY-
Or that's-- Yeah? Okay, so.
Is there some way I can try to take a shot, but also pull them into her spiritual weapon?
-MATT-
You mean. I would allow you to, if you wanted to, attempt to pull it into spiritual weapon instead of your attack, it would take the spiritual weapon damage.
-ASHLEY-
What's your spiritual weapon damage?
-LAURA-
It's probably not as good as your attack.
It's 2d8 plus five.
-ASHLEY-
That's pretty good. Okay.
I'll take a first hit.
-MATT-
Go for it.
First swing on it.
-MARISHA-
Take it, take it.
-SAM-
♪ Take that first tip. ♪
-ASHLEY-
23.
-MATT-
23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
-ASHLEY-
Savage Attacker.
Plus eight. Much better.
-TRAVIS-
I didn't take any swings on her.
-SAM-
Has anyone attacked Avantika?
-TRAVIS-
Beau did.
-ASHLEY-
31 points of damage for the first hit.
-MATT-
31. Nice! Second strike carves through.
You watch now as you chop one of its giant pincer arms off and it hits the ground is bleeding out on that side.
It's looking pretty hurt.
It's still clutching with its other claw and its tentacles.
whipping against it and trying to clutter past your armor to get to your flesh and it's really gross.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. I'm going to take another hit.
-MARISHA-
Fjord.
-ASHLEY-
20.
-MATT-
20 hits.
-MARISHA-
What if we do a little, like, shake and bake top of next turn? Like, either I give you advantage or vice versa by assisting.
-ASHLEY-
12 damage points of damage.
-MATT-
12 points of damage?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
She's going to get a turn before then.
-MATT-
You carve a second slash into it.
One of its legs collapses underneath.
It is limping. It is barely holding on.
It is on the cusp of death, but it's holding on with whatever strength it has left.
Some sort of unworldly influence has brought these here and have given it a stronger will than the need to survive.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. So then with my bonus action, and since I haven't moved, can I try to drag him into the spiritual weapon?
-MATT-
It would be an action to do that, unfortunately--
-ASHLEY-
It will be an action to do that. Okay.
-MATT-
But you've done a shitton of damage to this creature, you have a single handedly brought it from a fairly hefty sack of hit points to almost none in a round and a half.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
That's a big pain in the ass.
-ASHLEY-
That's all I can do.
That's all I can do!
-MATT-
All right. It's Avantika's turn.
She starts her round in both of your ranges.
-TALIESIN-
Yep, let's roll our damage.
-MATT-
Against you, Jester, that is a 20.
So succeeds and against-- Same roll. 20 from both of you.
So half damage from both of your spiritual guardians.
-MARISHA-
How is she dead and awesome?
-LAURA-
28, so 14 damage from me.
-LIAM-
She's French.
-TALIESIN-
19.
-MATT-
Halved to nine.
-TRAVIS-
We don't know if she's undead or resurrected.
-LIAM-
Is she dead, or is she Jamedi Cosko dead?
-SAM-
What if she was always dead?
-MATT-
The cold energy that's on her torso, shatters and evaporates.
She's taken enough damage to now disengage the Armor of Agathys that protects her.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
After she weathers the blows of celestial anger and destruction from both of your sources of divinity, whether real or illusion.
-LIAM-
Helium balloons.
-LAURA-
Mine are real, okay? Mine are super fucking real.
-MATT-
I'm going to go ahead and-- It is in her space, which means for free, she can grab it.
So she grabs the orb and puts it in her pocket, like in a little side pouch right there.
She has it.
And she's looking at you on this moment where it seems like the time slows as she's calculating in her brain.
-LIAM-
Beauregard.
-MATT-
And she's going to go ahead and sidestep around Fjord.
-MARISHA-
I'm watching her.
-MATT-
Over here and back over here.
-MARISHA-
She's not leaving my range.
-TALIESIN-
Two attacks of opportunity.
-SAM-
No.
-MARISHA-
Has she left my range?
-SAM-
She hasn't left his range.
-TRAVIS-
She left Beau's.
-MATT-
From both Veth-- which, actually, she can, as a bonus action, disengage.
So she will, which ignores your attack of opportunity.
-MARISHA-
But me.
-LIAM-
Sentinel does not--
-MATT-
But Sentinel, I believe--
-MARISHA-
Ignores disengage.
-MATT-
I believe so.
So go for it. Make a strike.
-LAURA-
C'mon, Beau!
-LIAM-
Punch her in the skull.
-MARISHA-
Oh jeez louise! Oh my god!
-TRAVIS-
♪ Let the sun shine! ♪
-LIAM-
I believe.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Let ♪
-MARISHA-
Ooh, it's not good! 15.
-MATT-
15 misses.
(groaning)
-MARISHA-
I rolled real bad.
-MATT-
So in a blur, you swing with the staff and meet nothing but cold air.
And then you see this dart as shadow shifts around and within an instant, you feel the presence of Avantika behind you.
Now she's there, her eyes flash with a yellowish, a familiar yellowish power.
-LIAM-
Oh shit.
She goes, "It's a pleasure to see you all again.
It's a shame it has to end so soon." As she stomps her foot on the ground, she's going to cast Thunderwave at level five.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what who?
-LIAM-
Thunderwaving you.
Whoa.
-TALIESIN-
How much of her movement did she just use in being in rough terrain, by the way?
-MATT-
10.
-SAM-
Oh boy. She's going to knock us all overboard.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Counterspell.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, do--
-SAM-
Oh!
-LIAM-
I'm a dinosaur.
Oh, you are not a dinosaur!
-TRAVIS-
I'm not.
-LIAM-
Yes!
-TRAVIS-
It's my last 5th-level.
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spellcasting modifier to it.
-LIAM-
At 5th-level. He's still got to roll? She wasn't fucking around.
-TRAVIS-
Where's my spell casting modifier? Is that my--?
-MATT-
It's your charisma.
-TRAVIS-
That's was my charisma, that's okay, so just plus five.
-LIAM-
I don't know how warlocks work.
-LAURA-
No!
-MATT-
Natural one.
-ALL-
No!
-LAURA-
Why do the dice hate us tonight?!
-LIAM-
That was Sentinel punch and the Counterspell!
-MARISHA-
I rolled a three.
-LAURA-
The dice really like Avantika.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
Wah wah wah wah wah.
-MATT-
Okay. I need--
-LIAM-
Oh man.
-MATT-
I need Beauregard, Fjord, and Veth to all make constitution saving throw us for me, please.
-LIAM-
This is the best.
I'm so glad you rolled a one.
-MARISHA-
All right. Well, I wish that would have happened sooner.
-TRAVIS-
New dice.
No, I'm going to give you a chance for redemption.
18.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-TRAVIS-
Constitution saving throw?
-MATT-
Correct.
-TRAVIS-
18.
-MATT-
18.
-MARISHA-
21.
-SAM-
Oh! I also rolled well. 16.
-MATT-
16...
16 does not succeed.
-SAM-
Damn! I'm going to go over.
-MATT-
But the other ones do.
32 points of thunder damage to you.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
Both of you take 16 points of thunder damage.
Veth is thrown overboard.
-LIAM-
Whoa.
-SAM-
Area.
Wait. Can I take--?
-TALIESIN-
You have Water Walk.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-SAM-
Can I take-- not Uncanny Dodge, what was the other one? Evasion?
-MATT-
You didn't succeed on your save, though.
-SAM-
Totally right.
-MATT-
And it wasn't a dexterity.
-MARISHA-
I did, though.
-LIAM-
Evasion is just dex.
-MARISHA-
Evasion, I always forget I have that as a monk.
-MATT-
It's not a dex save, though.
-MARISHA-
It's not a dex save.
I'll take that damage happily.
-MATT-
There you go.
You plummet off and begin to fall.
You do have your ring of water walking.
-TALIESIN-
Everyone still has Water Walk cast on them.
-MATT-
So you fall 20 feet and impact hard on the water below.
To take nine points of bludgeoning damage, hitting the icy surface of the ocean below.
-LIAM-
Bellyflop damage.
-TALIESIN-
Ow.
-SAM-
Am I prone or on my feet?
-TRAVIS-
There was no reason we should have had temporary hit points, right?
-MARISHA-
We did have temporary hit points from having tea with Vess DeRogna, I believe.
-SAM-
That was days ago.
-MATT-
That was a long time ago.
-MARISHA-
But don't they stay until you use them?
-MATT-
Until your next long rest.
-SAM-
Matthew, am I prone or standing?
-MATT-
You are standing.
I'll say. 20 feet you land.
You know what? Make an acrobatics check for me to see if you can land on your feet.
-SAM-
Check?
-MATT-
Yeah. Acrobatics.
-SAM-
Oh, I get Reliable Talent.
-MATT-
Yeah, so you're fine.
-SAM-
20.
-MATT-
Yeah. You're on your feet. You're fine.
That'll be a Avantika's action on that.
Cast that spell there.
-TRAVIS-
Does Thunderwave count as an attack roll? It doesn't, right?
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
It does-- Thunderwave? No, it is not an attack roll.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Okay. So that finishes Avantika's turn.
Now this creature here is going to appear behind--
-TRAVIS-
I'm sorry, real quick, where did Avantika go?
-MATT-
She's behind you. Right there.
-LIAM-
She's between you and the ballista.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
That creature has entered both of our-- had started its turn in both of our fields and has half speed.
-MATT-
Indeed. It barely moved, but it does take two saves from both of you.
So go ahead and roll damage.
-LAURA-
Roll damage?
-MATT-
Fail on both. So full damage from both of you for your spiritual guardians.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
22.
-LAURA-
26.
-MATT-
That fell.
22?
-TALIESIN-
22 radiant.
-MARISHA-
So she's still base to base with you, Fjord?
-LAURA-
26.
-MATT-
26, oof! That thing's looking hurt! It rushes in and gets blasted with both of these waves of energy and is like (gurgling).
Angry.
It's going to go ahead and take two swipes at you, Jester, and then one at you, Caduceus.
That is 17.
-LAURA-
Ooh, it misses!
-MATT-
Misses! 19.
-LAURA-
19.
-MATT-
You suffer 14 points of slashing damage, and then go ahead and make a constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
And then a strike against you.
That is going to be 20.
-TALIESIN-
Hits.
-MATT-
You take-- Ooh.
That is going to be 16 points of slashing damage against you, and also make constitution saving throw.
-LAURA-
14 constitution save?
-MATT-
You're fine.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Constitution saving throw?
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
Oof. Nope, that's a five.
-MATT-
Five? You lose concentration--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, wait! I have advantage on those rolls!
-MATT-
You do you if you have War Caster.
-TALIESIN-
I do.
-MATT-
So roll again.
-TALIESIN-
Aha! 17!
-MATT-
17, that succeeds.
-TALIESIN-
Yay! Never mind.
-MATT-
And then it teleports beyond the range, back to where it started over here.
Freaking out that one crew member over there who was back to the wall. (yells)
-LAURA-
I have War Caster!
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MATT-
Yeah, that's how you have advantage on these each time.
-LAURA-
Oh. I haven't been rolling with advantage.
-MATT-
Well, you should be doing that from now on.
-MARISHA-
Best part of War Caster, dude. Hell yeah.
-MATT-
That finishes its go, and now the two creatures are going to go.
The one that's barely limping along is going to go ahead and attempt to crush you, Yasha, within its claws.
Natural one, no issue.
That is a 16 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
It does not hit.
-MATT-
It does not hit.
It is trying to crush you, but it just has no strength left in its body.
It's so close to death's door as it's squeezing and squeezing you, you're just shaking your head how pitiful this creature is.
This guy over here, he's going to go ahead and take the same damage that you guys just dealt, which would be...
22 and 26.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
Succeeds, so this guy--
-LAURA-
Is 13.
-MATT-
Is 13. And...
Fails. 26.
-LAURA-
Wait, does that mean I can use my reaction against the frog guy? Did he already die?
-MATT-
No, he's not died, he teleported away.
-LAURA-
Oh. Could I have used my reaction when he hit me?
-MATT-
To?
-LAURA-
To attack him, since I-- with a spell, since that's War Caster.
-MATT-
He didn't move out of your range, he teleported, which is different from moving out of your range.
-LAURA-
But it's not if somebody moves out of my range, it's if somebody attacks me.
-MATT-
Oh, for War Caster?
-LAURA-
Isn't it?
-MATT-
I thought was--
-LAURA-
No, it's to use a reaction to spell them--
-MATT-
Yeah. For War Caster, it's if somebody is moving out of your melee range, where normally you'd get an attack of opportunity, you can cast a spell as a reaction to them.
-LAURA-
I understand. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
No worries, but this guy just teleports as part of his.
-LAURA-
An opportunity attack.
-LIAM-
It's great because it lets you cast an entirely additional spell in a around.
-MATT-
Exactly.
-LAURA-
That's killer.
-MATT-
Really good.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
All right.
So this guy, after taking a lot of damage, is going to go ahead and shift into range here, angry and furious that he's just being hurt.
-TALIESIN-
Half-speed as well.
-MATT-
I know. He only had to move 10 feet.
No, it's all good, man.
I need my Clippy. It's good.
I got too much concentrate on as a DM.
You guys got to remind me what your spells do.
-LIAM-
Was that crab creature within 10 feet of my ass? Now, I'm not where I am on the map.
I was between the steps.
-MATT-
For this, at this point, no, because he moved past him and went up to where you were.
-MARISHA-
I love the sentences that D&amp;D breeds.
-TALIESIN-
It's so amazing.
No one has ever said that before.
-LIAM-
I had asked to get between the stairs to look down.
You put me up there just because of the balance.
-MATT-
You know what? I would say, yes. It's within range.
-LIAM-
Then I'm going to tail that motherfucker--
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Bless you.
-LIAM-
That is a 29 to hit.
-MATT-
That's definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage with your tyrannosaurus tail.
-LIAM-
(gurgling) 17 points of bludgeoning damage for him.
-MATT-
17 points of bludgeoning damage.
Ooh, he's looking rough.
He's angrily going to go in there and strike at both, his two claw strikes one against each of you as he's trying to grab both of you who are holding onto these blasting, horribly painful radiuses of celestial anger.
They're just bearing down on it and everything in the vicinity.
Against Caduceus, that is going to be a 22 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
And against Jester, that is going to be 21 to hit.
-LAURA-
(scoffs unhappily)
-MATT-
So.
Ooh, max damage on that one.
That is 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Caduceus.
And 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Jester, and you are both grappled.
-TALIESIN-
Cool.
-LAURA-
Nice.
-MATT-
And we will say the tentacles begin to wrap out of it.
Caduceus, go ahead and make a constitution saving for me, please.
-LIAM-
Uh oh.
-TALIESIN-
It's better than last time.
-SAM-
Hey, it's the Olympics again!
-TALIESIN-
11.
-MATT-
11, you are poisoned and paralyzed.
-SAM-
Who's poisoned and paralyzed?
-LAURA-
Caduceus!
-SAM-
Oh no, he's going to get a new one, a new player character. Oh god!
-MATT-
So you feel the tentacles begin to affix to elements of your armor and squeeze past. As it hits you, your entire musculature begins to pulse and tighten.
Your eyeballs begin to bulge and you feel like they're about to pop out of your head and you're locked up.
Your entire body is locked in place.
And all you can hear now is that (pulsing) throughout your entire body.
That finishes its turn.
Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Yeah, Travis, could your origin story leave us alone?
-SAM-
I will use my movement to try to climb back up onto the ship.
-MATT-
It is a 20-foot climb to get to the top because it is a large icebreaker ship.
I'll say 15 feet, actually.
You're at half movement to climb.
Go ahead and roll an athletics check, because it is icy and it is slick.
-SAM-
Athletics?
-MATT-
Yes.
-SAM-
15.
-MATT-
15, that'll do it.
So with half of your movement, which would be 15 feet, that'll get you just up onto the deck, but that's the end of your movement there.
-SAM-
Okay.
Actually, can I pause before I get to the lip of the-- of the whatever it's called.
-MATT-
Sure.
-SAM-
The edge? The deck?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
And I would-- So I'm just peeking over the deck.
-MATT-
You're peeking over.
-SAM-
Peeking over the deck. I mean, she doesn't see me--
-MATT-
Correct.
-SAM-
-- but do I need-- I should try to hide.
-MATT-
I would say yes.
-SAM-
I will, bonus action, attempt to hide.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-SAM-
29.
-MATT-
29, that definitely feels pretty stealthy.
-SAM-
And then who has the football right now?
-LAURA-
She's got it on her side, hip pocket.
-SAM-
It's in her pocket.
-MATT-
It seems to be the moment, yeah.
Is Fjord holding his falchion? No.
-TRAVIS-
Star Razor, yes.
-MATT-
It's not the falchion.
Star Razor is in his hand, yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
I will, from my hiding position, I'll cast Phantasmal whatever on her.
-MATT-
Phantasmal whatever?
-SAM-
Phantasmal Force.
-MATT-
Okay. What's the save on that?
-SAM-
It is just a DC intelligence 16, but at disadvantage because I'm hidden.
-MATT-
Intelligence.
She rolled really well on that first one, but it's at disadvantage.
That is a 17 total.
-SAM-
Damn it!
-MATT-
Rolled a 19 and a 16.
I'm sorry. She only has a plus one on it.
-SAM-
Damn it.
-MATT-
That's a good try, though.
-LAURA-
What is that? A charisma or?
-SAM-
It's intelligence 16.
Damn it.
-MATT-
It was a good choice, but no effect, unfortunately.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
That finish your turn? All right.
Caleb, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Okay. I'm going to say that I use all of or a lot of my movement to get actually where the miniature is, because he was between the steps, but I'm just going to, like, crush stairs and heave myself up there--
-MATT-
To get to where? Up on--
-LIAM-
To where he is, you don't even have to move him because where he actually is, is between the stairs on the lower deck We just put him there for balance, but now he is right where he is.
I climbed up.
Actually, let's circle him a bit.
Make your life easier.
Yeah, right there.
-MATT-
There you go, look at that, look at that.
-LIAM-
Then I'm going to eat him for a snack.
-MATT-
Go for it. (laughs)
-LIAM-
That is an 18 to hit.
-MATT-
That indeed does hit!
-LIAM-
He is grappled in my mouth.
-MATT-
Oh god, that's terrifying.
-LIAM-
He takes.
-MATT-
Imagine how terrifying it would be to be a creature of the sea to suddenly to, One: Learn what a T-rex is, and then have it bite you and hold you in its mouth.
-LIAM-
28 points of piercing damage and he is grappled grappled in my mouth.
-MATT-
He is grappled. He cannot move, and he is stuck there in your jaws.
We'll say, for the purposes of this, I have another one here and just go.
-LIAM-
Ahh!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-MATT-
(yelling) (yells) Perfect.
-TALIESIN-
This is both threatening and unbelievably silly at the same time.
-MATT-
It's the best kind.
-ASHLEY-
I love it so much.
-LIAM-
I would like to think that the entire ship has went (creaking) in the water.
-MATT-
It's a pretty big ship.
It's pretty big ship, I'll say it's a slight tilt.
Okay, that finishes your go?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right. Jester, you're up.
Caduceus, you're on deck.
-LAURA-
I'm going to use my bonus action to attack the lobster that's fighting Yasha.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Get it.
-LAURA-
26!
-MATT-
26, that definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
-LAURA-
16 points.
-MATT-
16 points.
-LAURA-
Of serrated lollipop damage!
-MATT-
As the lollipop swings over in a wide buzzsaw arc, hits the-- You see sparks flying off as it hits the outside of the shell.
Then, like cutting through chain, it goes through and its body just folds in two halves.
In this wet smack sound.
-LIAM-
That was candy chips.
-MATT-
You watch as the gore splatters and immediately begins to crystallize into ice.
It is destroyed and Yasha is no longer grappled.
-SAM-
Freedom.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Can I move?
-MATT-
That's your bonus action.
-LAURA-
Yes, can I use the rest of the spiritual weapon movement to move it? Or does it have to--?
-MATT-
It's usually move 20 feet and then attack.
I'll let you move it. Sure, why not.
-LAURA-
Move 20 feet towards us.
-MARISHA-
She's in between Fjord and the ballista.
-LAURA-
It's basically a T-rex. It just won't hold still.
-MATT-
It just won't hold still. That's fine.
-LAURA-
And then I'm going to go super-- This is probably not going to work, but I'm going to give it a try.
-MATT-
What you doing?
-LAURA-
I'm going to try to...
-SAM-
Commune.
-LAURA-
Dominate Person.
-MATT-
To?
-LAURA-
Avantika.
-MATT-
Avantika...
is going to cast Counterspell.
-LAURA-
Okay.
I cast it at 6th-level.
-MATT-
You have to say before.
-LAURA-
I only-- it's a 5th-level spell.
I'm out of 5th-levels.
So I only could cast it at 6th-level.
I didn't know that, you know what I mean?
-MATT-
That's fine. She casts everything at 5th-level.
So she does still have to roll for it.
Natural 18 plus four.
Unfortunately. It was a good shot, but unfortunately she does.
-LAURA-
I knew it was a high risk, but I thought it could be cool if it worked.
-SAM-
Yes, it would've been very cool.
-ASHLEY-
It was a cool idea.
-SAM-
It would also be very cool if any of my shit worked all night.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Any of us!
-MATT-
Yeah. Yeah. It's been a little tough.
-MARISHA-
Bad rolls, bad rolls.
-LAURA-
I'm still grappled. Cool.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Okay, does that finish your go?
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's all I got.
-MATT-
Sorry. All right, Caduceus, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
I am paralyzed, so I'm just...
I can't really do anything, can I? I have no roll against this?
-MATT-
No, at the end of your turn, you can make another constitution saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, okay, well, I'll make another constitution saving throw.
-MATT-
Indeed.
-SAM-
You can go to your mind palace.
-TALIESIN-
Come on.
Oh! 20.
-MATT-
20, you are no longer poisoned and paralyzed.
-SAM-
Oh, whoa.
-MATT-
But you are still grappled.
-LIAM-
Clean living.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-MATT-
What you did there was prevent auto-crits against you from the creature.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
And my ring is still up, so that's nice.
-MATT-
Yep.
Actually, interesting point of order.
Let me see here.
-TALIESIN-
It doesn't break concentration.
-MATT-
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
-TALIESIN-
It doesn't. I looked it up.
-MATT-
You did? All right, then, I trust you.
-LIAM-
I remember at the end of the last game, I was like: Come on, why aren't we doing this now?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to check. Now you're freaking me out.
-LIAM-
Four hours.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Battle at this level with this many players, it's going to take a chunk of time.
Especially any worthwhile battle.
All right, so that finishes your go, Caduceus.
-TALIESIN-
Yep. No, I'm good.
-MATT-
This person's going to go ahead and attempt to situate this ballista with their action.
This guy over here is going to-- now that one is-- now that he can see and the fog is gone, he's going to go ahead and rotate it, and attempt to point blank fire at the creature right here.
So he's actually probably going to move along with the back of it. He's going to swing over the edge, grab the edge of the ballista and kick off, and off the edge of the ship, to turn the opposite side and then as the aims it up, fire towards the creature that has both of our clerics grappled.
-LIAM-
Good job, Ted.
-MATT-
That is going to be a...
It just hits with a 16.
-LAURA-
Yes! Save us, Ted!
-MATT-
With that, this does...
All right, so that is 4d10 piercing damage.
18 points of piercing damage against it.
Plus 8d6 lightning damage.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh, those fucking ballistas are no joke.
-MATT-
I'm just not going to roll.
As he fires in an upward angle, it shoots into its torso, and the creature gets lifted at almost the exact same speed, thrust upward off the deck and almost beans you in the face.
As it swings past, an arc of energy trailing behind it, as it vanishes into the storm, no longer able to be stable.
Both of you are un-grappled.
(cheering)
-LAURA-
I'm glad it let go of us as it was going away.
-TALIESIN-
Before it flew.
-MATT-
All righty. That finishes...
the crew's go.
It is now the mage's turn, who is...
is not doing well in the mouth of that.
It's going to go ahead and...
It's going to emit a psychic screech--
-LIAM-
Oh dear.
-MATT-
-- as its action and (screeching), just gives this high pitched, horrible sound that billows in a 30-foot radius, which will only affect you and the captain.
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
-LIAM-
That should go well.
Nope.
That's a five.
-MATT-
Yeah, and the captain fails, too.
He falls to his knees, clutching his head.
You are both stunned.
-LIAM-
(groaning) Is he still in my mouth?
-MATT-
I will say--
-LIAM-
He didn't try to get out.
-MATT-
He didn't try to get out yet.
-LIAM-
It's just like the crab people.
They were--
-MARISHA-
Yes, exactly.
They kept me held on.
-LAURA-
"Is it still in my mouth?" (laughing)
-MATT-
So until the end of its next turn, you are stunned.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
Which means it'll make it easier for it to escape next turn.
-LAURA-
I was thinking about--
-MATT-
So, that finishes its go.
-LAURA-
-- the T-Rex trying to cover his ears with his teeny T-rex arms.
-MATT-
Beauregard.
-MARISHA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
Beauregard.
You're up.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I was being a T-Rex.
I'm sorry.
-TALIESIN-
Haven't we all.
-MARISHA-
Where am I? Here I am.
-MATT-
You're right there.
-MARISHA-
Where's Avantika?
-MATT-
Right there.
-MARISHA-
She's holding a thing.
She's still holding it, yeah?
-MATT-
She put into her a little side pouch pocket.
-MARISHA-
She put it into her pocket.
And I'm going to just go over and beat her ass, at this point.
-MATT-
All right, go for it.
-ASHLEY-
Beat her ass!
-LAURA-
Yes, finally.
-MATT-
So you dart over to close off that side of the ship deck.
-MARISHA-
I just look at her and I'm like: No.
And then I punch her.
-MATT-
(laughs) "No."
-MARISHA-
Twice, no.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-MARISHA-
Oh, jeez.
All right, all right.
Okay.
That one is 28 to hit.
-MATT-
28 hits.
-MARISHA-
And that one is...
Hang on, wait.
20-- yeah, that was 28, and that is 19?
-MATT-
19 misses.
-MARISHA-
19 misses, which sucks.
But I hit her with that first one.
-LIAM-
Good.
-TRAVIS-
19 misses.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
20 misses.
-MARISHA-
That's an eight. That's good.
Okay, okay.
18 damage, Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
18 damage, Stunning Strike?
-LIAM-
<i>Super, fantastique.</i>
-MATT-
That is going to be a 18.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, she saves.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
Okay, what else can I do, what else can I do? Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
All right, go for it.
-MARISHA-
I wish there was something more I could do.
Yikes.
Definitely one of those misses, but the other one is a 19 for 31?
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-LAURA-
Jeez louise.
-MARISHA-
And that's 17 damage.
-MATT-
17 damage, awesome.
-SAM-
Come on, Yasha, batter up.
Aren't you like--
-MATT-
Extract Aspects?
-SAM-
90 feet away from the action?
-MATT-
Right?
-MARISHA-
Oh.
Yeah, Extract Aspects.
I forgot.
-MATT-
Your subclass.
One of the...
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
Well, I did it on the lobsters.
-MATT-
That's true.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, let's do it on Avantika.
-LIAM-
It's busy deck.
-MATT-
It's a busy deck.
So as you go in and swing a few times, get a couple of hits in, with that final blow, you manage to concentrate on the energetic flow that keeps Avantika standing, the essence of her body, and as you take a moment to get in tune with that, you sense that she is resistant to necrotic damage.
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-MATT-
She is immune to being charmed, frightened, poisoned, and stunned.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-LIAM-
Oh.
She's your nemesis.
-MARISHA-
Bitch.
-TRAVIS-
She can't be charmed, frightened, or stunned, and--
-MATT-
And poisoned.
-LAURA-
She can't be charmed?
-MATT-
She can't be charmed.
-LAURA-
So that Dominate Person wouldn't have worked anyway?
-MATT-
Probably not, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Charmed, frightened, stunned, poisoned.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-LIAM-
Because she's a dead person.
-MARISHA-
Because she's dead, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Hell hath no fury.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-TALIESIN-
And immune to necrotic.
-MARISHA-
And immune to necrotic.
-ASHLEY-
Immune to necrotic. Okay.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-SAM-
But she's not immune to one thing.
Boomerang! (laughter)
-MATT-
Nobody is, Sam.
Nobody.
-TALIESIN-
I like the way you brought that back around.
-MATT-
So Beau, that finishes your turn?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, and I shout everything out to the group.
-MATT-
Okay, so as Beauregard is pulling back and giving this instruction, we go to Fjord's turn, with Yasha on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Charge.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
For my bonus action, I'm going to cast Searing Smite at 1st-level, and I'm going to take two swings with the Star Razor at Avantika.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
Oof oof oof.
Motherfucker.
That is a 19.
-MATT-
19 misses.
-TRAVIS-
Second one.
Nope.
-MATT-
You try and swing, and she deflects and parries with her offhand dagger, this horrible, hooked black metal dagger, the rapier's just at the ready, preparing for her next round. Just (metal clanging).
-TRAVIS-
Yep, yep, yep, yep-yep, yep, yep.
-MATT-
All right. Fjord, staying put, or are you going to move?
-TRAVIS-
Staying put.
-MATT-
All right, finishes Fjord's go.
Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. Okay.
So these, these, these, these bal-- these things, these weapons, ballistas.
-MATT-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
Can anybody use them?
-MATT-
Yeah. It takes an-- You gather it takes an action to load it and then an action to fire.
So it does a lot of damage, but it takes either a two-person team to do it every round, or one person once every two rounds.
-ASHLEY-
That feels like a lot of work.
Okay.
I'm going to start making my way down-- SAM and MARISHA: ♪ (opening notes of "A Thousand Miles") ♪
-- to Miss Avantika.
-MATT-
40'll get you right there.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I love us.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Just made of inside jokes.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to take an attack.
-SAM-
The same three inside jokes over and over again.
-MATT-
Go for it. You got your strikes on this.
-LIAM-
It's 10% gravitas and 90% bullshit.
-ASHLEY-
Goddamn it.
18 for the first hit.
So that obviously doesn't hit.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, wait are you--
-MATT-
18 does not hit.
-TALIESIN-
Is she...
You're a... Buh dih buh dah.
-LAURA-
What?
-TALIESIN-
When someone's on the other side of you.
-LAURA-
Flanked?
-TALIESIN-
Flanked.
-MATT-
She is not flanking, because in order to get into melee with Avantika, she's coming at catty-corner position.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
Darn.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, let's do it again.
Oh, oh.
28.
-MATT-
That hits.
Go ahead and roll damage.
This is full damage because it's your first time hitting in the round.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
Okay.
Savage Attacker.
Much better.
30 points of damage.
-MATT-
Ooh! The first, as you rush down the stairs, getting your blade in this one upward arc, it's a bit telegraphed, and as you rush down, Avantika sidesteps to the side and it slams into the ground.
In that moment, you use that to pull upward at an angle.
As you do, you strike her right in the side. She (grimaces).
-ASHLEY-
I have a question.
-MATT-
Yes?
-ASHLEY-
Because I'm using Magician's Judge, because I attuned to it--
-MATT-
Correct.
-ASHLEY-
It says if I hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to cast Dispel Magic.
-MATT-
Correct.
-ASHLEY-
Can I try to Dispel Magic on the Cloven Crystal?
-MATT-
Unfortunately, Dispel Magic is to stop magical effects, like spells or, you know, things that are lasting attacks.
You cannot dispel a magical item necessarily.
-ASHLEY-
Copy.
Okay.
-MATT-
And since you're attacking her, it would have to be an effect that's affecting her.
-ASHLEY-
Copy, okay.
-MATT-
But good looking out, good looking out.
That finish your turn?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
It is now Avantika's turn.
Avantika is in both of your radiuses.
-LIAM-
Get ready to sentinel.
Fucking dual clerics, man, I swear to god.
Natural one on yours.
And hold on, even with the bonus? Fail on both, full damage on both.
That's some shitty rolls.
-LAURA-
21.
-MATT-
21 damage? All right.
-TALIESIN-
22.
-MATT-
Damn!
-SAM-
Whoa.
-TALIESIN-
Burn.
Burn!
-LAURA-
40!
-MATT-
After she takes the blow from Yasha's attack and the blade pulls away, a bit of dark gray liquid that was once blood that no longer flows and pumps through her body naturally.
As she prepares herself, all the surrounding, swirling, celestial insects and hamster unicorns are blasting into her and you can see the skin burning away at certain points of her jaw and face.
(snarling, panting) "I got what I came for." And she's going to use her last slot to cast Dimension Door.
-LIAM-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
And you are T-Rex.
-LIAM-
I'm a T-Rex, I'm eating.
-SAM-
Damn it!
-MARISHA-
Wait, does that give an opportunity attack?
-LAURA-
No.
-LAURA-
You don't get an attack.
-MATT-
Unless anyone has the Mage Slayer feat.
-SAM-
Nope.
-MATT-
Then no.
-LIAM-
Well, Fjord, what are you doing?
-TRAVIS-
What do you mean?
-TALIESIN-
Do you not have a--
-SAM-
He already burned it.
-TALIESIN-
You burned your Counterspell?
-LAURA-
He already used his Counterspell.
-TRAVIS-
I only have, like, two spell slots.
-ASHLEY-
There's got to be something I can do! We can't grab her or anything?
-MATT-
You just see her look over the edge of the boat this way, and then bring her blade up to her face, and give a half bow to all of you, and then vanish in purple smoke.
-LIAM-
I love it.
-ASHLEY-
Can I try to throw one of those alchemical fire grenades in there?
-MATT-
Sure.
You throw it overboard in her direction and it vanishes into the fog.
But in that brief moment that you realize that she is gone, with the Cloven Crystal, we're going to take a break.
-MARISHA-
No!
-MATT-
For the purposes of the narrative here, this guy has not a whole lot of hit points left.
He's not a big chunk.
The T-Rex can eat him next round.
-LIAM-
I eat him.
-SAM-
Wait! We're keeping someone alive?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, let's interrogate the lobster.
-LAURA-
They don't even speak, remember?
-SAM-
Oh, he's a lobster? Oh yeah.
-MATT-
Well yeah, this is the mage guy.
But you are a T-Rex who is hungry.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm eating him, and you can't stop me from eating him. I'm eating him.
-MATT-
In the moment you hear the screams and crunching on the upper part of the deck, you all take a moment to realize what just happened, and you have a break to decide what you want to do as a reaction.
We'll be back here in just a minute.
We'll see you guys here shortly.
Announcer: Now experienced the ultimate way to play by sitting at a table with your friends with your face in a screen.
Progress! D&amp;D Beyond.
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities, thanks to a company based in a really boring one that handles all the tedious math and reference stuff for you, so you can finally unleash the epic quest you've been crafting since middle school on your friends or just do what most people use it for, cranking out endless new characters while they're bored at work.
"I could finish these spreadsheets but what if this Paladin owned a horse?" (angelic music) Perfect.
D&amp;D Beyond. Play with advantage.
I think we need to reincorporate ice giants and frost giants into the lore of the North Pole.
I think it's just- Everyone knows that the North Pole is guarded by a family of frost giants, and originally before reindeer, Santa Claus' sled was pulled by yetis.
Does not everybody know that? See, I want, I want that movie.
I want to see like, they were like, "Oh, Santa and his elves, every single gift in the world.
Think of all the eBay money we can make! We're just going to go ahead and do it.
The greatest heist of Old St. Nick," and they get there and there's just this giant sitting there armored up going, "Mr. Claus didn't invite you." (imitates smashing) (upbeat music) (soft music) Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role Shop.
The Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision.
The cuteness, it's overpowering.
Roll an investigation, if you want.
It's basically perfect.
Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself.
Can you put donuts in this? I don't know, only one way to find out.
So click on over to the Critical Role Shop.
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.
You've still got time.
(dramatic music) I started with my kid gloves with our first story, and now that I know that we've all felt the true pain.
Pretty hard.
Matt going full throttle though, terrifies me.
It should.
That was tough, my god.
Maybe the next person should be like super easy or something like that.
No.
Yeah.
I hate this, I'm so glad we're done with this.
(all laughing) We're not.
I feel that, I feel that.
We're coming back, Ashley.
No! No! And guys, I've learned so much from all of you.
No, Matthew! What does that mean? (upbeat music) (jazz music) Hello, everyone.
It's me, Marisha Ray, creative director for Critical Role content, and I want to take a moment to speak from the heart about how much we appreciate your support.
No frills, no crazy gags. Just honesty.
Over the past five years, we've made a lot of ridiculous promos in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes, and putting our loyal employees in slightly embarrassing situations, eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes written by Brian W. Foster or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate an obscure commercial most people haven't seen to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account requires you to resubscribe each month.
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you that you can easily give subscriptions to fellow Critters if you're feeling generous.
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days shooting complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe is a vintage spooky boy in full monochromatic glory, all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub, but not today.
No weird graphics, no puppet murder.
No Sam Reigel.
It's just me, here to say thank you.
Love you all. Good night.
(jazz music)
And welcome back.
So, where we left off, in the middle of this unexpected, chaotic battle on the top of the Midnight Hammer icebreaker ship in the Frigid Depths, north of the Greying Wildlands, you were all unexpectedly ambushed by Captain Avantika, back from the grave.
Now currently even further empowered and focused by her patron, Uk'otoa, long abandoned by Fjord Stone, and seeking the final orb that would unlock, unseal, and release Uk'otoa from his prison.
In the middle of this battle, you tore through the various crawling chuul creatures that were coming your way from the ocean below, the crustaceans.
You turned into a T-Rex and swallowed the the mage companion to Avantika, the demonic creature, the strange frog individual that was tethered in some way to Avantika, called through, seems to have vanished with some of the damage that she had taken recently, no longer held in this domain by her concentration.
But she did manage to grab the orb, and with a small bow, vanished from sight, facing in a somewhat west, southwest direction from where the ship is currently heading.
What would you like to do?
-SAM-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
What do we do? What do we do?
-SAM-
What happened?
-TALIESIN-
Going for it.
-SAM-
This is crazy.
-TALIESIN-
Don't let her get away.
-SAM-
What do we do?
-MATT-
What are you doing?
-MARISHA-
We very much lost.
-TALIESIN-
I am throwing Divine Intervention.
-SAM-
Does anyone need healing or anything?
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
In pain.
-TALIESIN-
I did not succeed.
-LAURA-
I'm going to Divine Intervention, too.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, man.
We only got two of these. They're worth a shot.
-SAM-
I'm also going to Divine Intervention.
-LAURA-
Two-- okay.
-SAM-
I found Jesus.
-LAURA-
What am I trying to roll? Below my--
-MATT-
Your level or below, so 13 or under.
So declare one is as the digit, the tens.
-LAURA-
I've got the doubles and the single
-MATT-
You got it.
Go for it.
-LIAM-
Come on.
-LAURA-
No.
-MATT-
No.
Unfortunately, your entities cannot reach you in the midst of this chaos.
-TRAVIS-
Neither worked.
-MARISHA-
No?
-LAURA-
Are we going after her?
-MATT-
The force and influence of Uk'otoa--
-TRAVIS-
Can anyone make us dolphins or something?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to quickly heal everybody, just with a quick action.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to, yeah, hit everyone with a Mass Cure Wounds.
-LAURA-
Who's going after her?
-MARISHA-
Maybe--
-TRAVIS-
I would like to go.
-MARISHA-
I would like to go, but maybe I can run along the surface and chase you guys.
-TALIESIN-
15.
-SAM-
Hey, that's great.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Yasha?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I could do it.
I could also try to run? I don't have cold damage.
I mean, I don't have cold resistance. Does that matter?
-LAURA-
I don't know.
-MATT-
Well, does anyone here have Water Walk?
-MATT-
Okay, that's right.
How long does that last?
-LAURA-
It lasts for an hour, doesn't it?
-TALIESIN-
Longer, I think, hold on.
-MATT-
Just double-check.
-SAM-
When did you cast it?
-LAURA-
At the beginning of the fight.
-MARISHA-
Top of the fight.
-LIAM-
Oh, you're all water skiing.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
One hour, you're right,
-LIAM-
Rogues water skiing.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
I'm down to water ski a killer whale.
-TALIESIN-
We've got Water Walk.
-LAURA-
Can you drop it on some people?
-TALIESIN-
Everyone's got it.
I cast it at the beginning of this-
-LAURA-
No, I mean, if we polymorph into sea creatures, will we just be sea creatures stuck on top of the water?
-MATT-
(thumping)
-TALIESIN-
I think you can just disengage it at will.
-MARISHA-
Just jet skiing off a killer whale?
-LAURA-
If you disengage some people does it disengage everybody?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, because it's not a concentration spell.
I think you can just decide that it's over.
-MATT-
I will say you can decide to end it on a person who it's currently on, on an individual basis.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, the Hexblade's Curse doesn't provide a Hunter's Mark capability.
-MATT-
No, it does not.
-TRAVIS-
Not like that.
-LAURA-
All right.
I'm going to Polymorph a couple people.
-LIAM-
So are we going different directions? We're going the way she left? I was a dinosaur, what happened?
-LAURA-
I think we just--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we should--
-LAURA-
Jesus. 100 feet.
-TRAVIS-
I'm with you, if she was pointing one direction, we should all three take that direction, make a variance of, like, 15 to 20 degrees off of that center line and just go like that.
-MARISHA-
And then go that way. Yes.
-LAURA-
All right, let's go.
-LIAM-
Okay, so who are the killer whales? You and me?
-LAURA-
I'm not being a whale; I'm going to ride a whale.
-TRAVIS-
I'll be one.
-LAURA-
Whale.
-LIAM-
Whale.
-ASHLEY-
I'll be a whale, I'll be a whale, I'll be a whale!
-LAURA-
All right, I'm going to use my Ring of Spell Splitting, and I'm going to cast Polymorph on both Yasha and Fjord, and turn them both into killer whales.
As we leap off the ship.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'd like to jump off.
-MATT-
Both you and Fjord look at each other, nod, and then go into a sprint and then dive off the edge of the ship.
-LAURA-
And as they dive, I'm going to cast it out.
-MATT-
In mid-arc, they both balloon out into massive, black and white orcas before crashing into the icy waters below, of which orcas are quite familiar with.
You aren't affected by the cold temperatures of the ocean below you.
-LIAM-
I grab a rope and shove it in my mouth and I run to the side and turn into an orange and white killer whale, like a Fanta mascot, and go (splashes).
-LAURA-
I'm going to grab one of the ropes as he jumps and I'm going to jump in after him.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
I run and I grab one of the ropes from the rigging and I throw it around Yasha as she transforms.
-TALIESIN-
I guess we're doing this.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
We're going after her! Yep.
-MATT-
Okay, so who's--
-SAM-
Where are we going?
-LIAM-
Three directions.
-MATT-
So we have two of the killer whales currently have ropes in their mouth.
Who is affixed to which killer whale?
-LAURA-
I said I was affixed to the Caleb whale.
-MARISHA-
I'm affixed to the Yasha whale.
-TALIESIN-
I'll be affixed to-- who else is a whale? You're a whale? Fjord, I'm with you.
-MARISHA-
Veth?
-SAM-
I mean, just gaming this out here.
If you're attached to, like, a 30-foot rope or something.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-SAM-
What if the whale needs to dive?
-MARISHA-
We'll figure that out.
-LIAM-
Figure that out when we get to it.
-SAM-
Let go and hope we can get back?
-LAURA-
We can all breathe water.
Drop it.
-TRAVIS-
We can all breathe underwater.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Veth, get on my back.
-SAM-
I don't want to go out there!
-MARISHA-
I grab Veth as I fly over the edge.
-SAM-
(shouting) (laughter)
-MATT-
Okay, so Veth is going with Beauregard, who is currently holding onto the Yasha.
-SAM-
But it's cold!
I don't want to go!
-MATT-
Jester, you're going with?
-LAURA-
I grabbed the Caleb rope.
-MATT-
The Caleb rope. All right.
And Caduceus, who are you going with?
-TALIESIN-
I'm on the Fjord rope.
-MATT-
Fjord didn't have a rope.
-LAURA-
No, he did not grab a rope.
-MATT-
He did not grab a rope.
-SAM-
Go back and get a rope!
-TALIESIN-
I'm grabbing on with Jester, then.
-MATT-
All right, Jester and Caduceus, you leap off the edge of the ship and are pulled down by the weight of an orca onto the hard surface of the ocean, in which you are water walking.
So.
Oh, I was picturing it, like, leaping, trying to be cool.
-MARISHA-
Same.
-MATT-
It is cool.
It is cool.
-SAM-
Down by 2000--
-MATT-
But you're still being pulled down by 2000 pounds into the surface of the ocean in which you are--
-LAURA-
I didn't want to water walk, I wanted to dive into the water, but--
-SAM-
Water Walking is on us. We have to--
-MATT-
Unless you wanted to cancel it.
-LAURA-
I wanted to cancel, because we can all breathe under water too, and I'm cold resistant, so I was planning on holding onto the rope and just going.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Just imagine it like New Jersey's Action Park.
It's cool.
-MATT-
Not entirely wrong.
You're not entirely wrong.
-LIAM-
I went there five times as a child.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
You did not!
-LIAM-
I'm from Jersey, man.
-ASHLEY-
We need to talk about this later.
-TRAVIS-
I have questions.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I hurt myself.
-SAM-
I'm not cold resistant.
What are we doing?
-LAURA-
I'm just jumping in. I'm cold resistant.
I don't know if it's smart for everybody to do it.
-SAM-
I'm not cold resistant. I'm not going in the water.
-TALIESIN-
Don't go in the water.
-LIAM-
You're on Beauregard's back.
-MARISHA-
We're skiing.
-SAM-
Okay, let's ski on the surface.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right, so you both are keeping Water Walking on.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You're keeping Water Walking on?
-LIAM-
This is ridiculous.
-MATT-
All right.
You all take six points of bludgeoning damage as you impact into the surface and just holding on, your feet or skidding across the surface, which is slick like ice based on both the temperature and the magical effect that you're under.
But with that case, you are being pulled along at an immense speed.
What is the speed of the orca?
-LIAM-
60 feet per round.
-MATT-
Which means, at a dash, you are moving 120 feet per round.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
I'm keeping track of the race here now.
This is interesting.
-TRAVIS-
Expeditious Retreat doesn't amp that up, does it?
-MATT-
It would.
-TRAVIS-
I have that.
-LAURA-
But you can't cast it.
-MATT-
Can't cast it because you're a whale.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, makes sense.
-LIAM-
Yes.
All the spells go away.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
This is uncharted territory for me.
-LIAM-
Believe me, if I could be a casting T-Rex, I would be.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that makes sense.
-MATT-
And that would be terrifying.
I would throw that at you every game.
-MARISHA-
Play a druid.
-MATT-
All right. So.
-MARISHA-
Get to level 20 and play a druid.
-MATT-
As you guys are all making your way through the water, the dark, freezing depths below, your feet now immediately numb within the first 30 seconds or so of skidding across the surface.
-SAM-
Oh no! Is that a small iceberg in front of us, Beau, shaped like a ramp?! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Oh no, I think it is.
Hold on tight.
Whoa!
-MATT-
Make an acrobatics check for me.
-MARISHA-
And then we do a barrel roll. Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Do a barrel roll.
-MARISHA-
Do a barrel roll!
-ASHLEY-
I make sure to swim a little bit to like--
-MATT-
Help give a little rush to it? You got it, you got it.
-MARISHA-
20.
-MATT-
20.
As you skid off of this side, the water spraying up a bit, you manage to just find the incline of this one slightly akimbo ice shelf and you go leaping at a full angle and land, doing a complete barrel roll off the edge of the ice and catch it there, still holding onto Veth.
-MARISHA-
Radical.
-LIAM-
Officially--
-SAM-
Totally tubular! (laughter)
-LIAM-
Officially jumping the shark, Critical Role is.
-ASHLEY-
I shout a whale (barking), or whatever they do.
-TRAVIS-
What was that?
What does your killer whale sound like?! (yodeling) Oh no!
-MATT-
Is that a baby grizzly?
-LIAM-
Was that foley? (wheezy barking)
-MATT-
All right, so you did give a few rounds to this.
So keeping tabs, the first round is 120 feet.
So I would like to have the orcas to make a perception check.
-LIAM-
And we've split, right? Like a Y.
-MATT-
Yes, you guys have gone into this trio, this trident formation to cover the most ground.
-LIAM-
Advantage perception.
-LAURA-
Can I look, too, since I'm underwater?
-MATT-
You can with disadvantage.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
13.
-ASHLEY-
15.
-LIAM-
12.
-MATT-
12.
Nothing yet.
-TRAVIS-
We don't have advantage, right? Not as orcas. Orcas don't get advantage, right, just you?
-MATT-
You are having no luck seeing any sign or trace of an entity or your quarry.
You do rush past and see a couple of shapes for a moment, but you see it's just a small cluster of seals that just dart away from you as fast as they can at your arrival.
-SAM-
The seal sound, Ashley?
-ASHLEY-
Wait, what do seals--?
-SAM-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
(weak scream) I don't know.
(laughter)
-MATT-
There you go.
-ASHLEY-
Trying to find it.
I don't know.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
That was a space ship taking off with all four rocket boosters imploding.
-ASHLEY-
(seal barking)
-ALL-
'Ey!
-ASHLEY-
There it is.
-MATT-
Continuing onward, you are staying close to the surface, currently, to keep these people here, right? So, moving to the 240 foot mark.
-TRAVIS-
240 foot.
-MATT-
Right.
-LAURA-
But you can dive down, you don't have anybody on you.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-SAM-
I'm going to make my way to the top of Beau.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
Onto her shoulders standing, and just like--
-LAURA-
Caduceus, can we dive under?
-TALIESIN-
Oh god, I don't want to, but-- ugh.
-MATT-
She can't talk. You can't...
-SAM-
I'll put my leg up.
-MATT-
Oh wait, wait, no, you can, you're holding on, you're holding on, sorry.
-MARISHA-
Yes. Yes.
-LIAM-
Wait, Caduceus is on which whale?
-MATT-
On you.
-LIAM-
On with us? Okay.
Yeah, the creamsicle whale dives.
-MATT-
Okay.
You watch as Caduceus and Jester-- (zwoop)
-LAURA-
Ahh!
-MATT-
-- beneath the water.
All righty.
I'd like a perception check from all three whales, please.
And then for both of you, perception checks with disadvantage.
-LIAM-
New dice.
-MARISHA-
Come on, come on.
-LAURA-
Natural 20!
-MATT-
With disadvantage?
-LAURA-
Oh, fuck me.
-LIAM-
Natural 20! (cheering)
-MATT-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
28.
-LIAM-
I rolled a 19 and a 20 with advantage.
-MATT-
With disadvantage for you?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That's great.
-TALIESIN-
28 with disadvantage.
-TRAVIS-
11.
-MATT-
11.
-LAURA-
21 with disadvantage.
-LIAM-
It's so pretty.
-TALIESIN-
26 with disadvantage, I'm sorry.
-SAM-
I'm going to roll, too, for the surface.
Maybe we'll see something on the surface.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, same.
-SAM-
I got a four.
-MARISHA-
I got...
a three.
(laughter) But we look amazing.
-MATT-
In fact, that's what you guys are focused on right now.
The adrenaline's still pumping from that landing.
It's pretty slick.
-MARISHA-
I just prop my-- and then do a full lift.
-SAM-
And I'll transfer so my hands are on her head.
-MARISHA-
Okay, perfect. Yeah.
And one-handed.
-SAM-
Oh, one hand?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, man.
And nailed it.
-MATT-
Nice.
Okay.
So, you don't see a sign of anything yet.
(groaning)
-LAURA-
Oh, fuck.
-MATT-
Even with the natural 20, there's nothing within your visual range here that catches your attention.
We move on to the next round.
-LAURA-
She's 500 feet.
-MARISHA-
That's it.
-LAURA-
500 feet.
-MARISHA-
How do you beat that?
-LAURA-
She can't swim as fast as we can.
-MATT-
Just because you roll really high doesn't mean that you can see miles away or anything at this distance.
It's a higher roll and proximity and location.
So I'm keeping track of a lot, all like a matrix here.
-LIAM-
I could have gotten the 19 and 20 in the wrong direction.
-SAM-
Yes, we also could be swimming in the wrong direction.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
No idea.
-MATT-
Also depends on, you know, surface and depth.
There's a lot of factors here.
And trio...
-ASHLEY-
Polymorph is an hour?
-LIAM-
An hour.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to--
-MATT-
All right.
So, yeah.
So now with you guys diving beneath the surface and you, are you diving as well or are you staying--
-TRAVIS-
60 feet under the surface.
-MATT-
60 feet under the surface? How deep are you, Caleb?
-LIAM-
How deep is my love? Like 100 feet down.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
100 feet?
-TRAVIS-
You'll lose visibility-
-LAURA-
That's terrible.
-LIAM-
Why?
-LAURA-
Because it's very dark down there, speaking from a scuba diver.
-LIAM-
I'm using hearing.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast Protection From Energy on myself while we're rolling.
-MATT-
Good call.
On cold, I imagine?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
The icy depths do not affect you negatively.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-MATT-
They were about to, but you're good.
Okay.
You watch, as you guys are holding on, Caduceus pulls one hand up and does like a slight undulating motion with his wrist, brings it back to his chest and there's this burst of cold energy around his torso that drifts off and you now see, as icy water seems to almost drift away from him in a forward impact, which is nice.
All right, perception checks from all of you beneath the surface.
You guys can make checks if you want.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, why not?
-TALIESIN-
16.
-MATT-
16, okay.
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
Again?
-TALIESIN-
Whoa.
-LIAM-
A one and a 20 this time.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
A natural one.
-SAM-
I got a six.
-TRAVIS-
Five.
-ASHLEY-
12.
-SAM-
We're talking about costumes now.
-MATT-
Five?
-LAURA-
15.
-MATT-
15, got it.
-MARISHA-
Like flames? I'm in ice and you are in flames.
-SAM-
Fire and ice? Perfect.
-MARISHA-
It's great.
-MATT-
Okay.
Caleb.
You hear thrashing, faintly in the water, loosely in the direction you are traveling, though you can't pinpoint it, but you do get the essence that there is something also swimming a ways ahead of you.
-LIAM-
Okay.
I go (whale call) and replicate what I learned from Star Trek.
That old Star Trek movie.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-LIAM-
Yep. (whale calls)
-TRAVIS-
San Francisco Bay, man.
-TALIESIN-
The Search for See-Through Aluminum.
-LIAM-
And call the other whales.
-TRAVIS-
(whale call)
-LIAM-
Move over, cows.
-TALIESIN-
Whales are the new cows.
-TRAVIS-
Sea cows.
-MATT-
The direction that you hear it from is a little bit upward, and it crosses with the path that Fjord is currently pursuing.
-LIAM-
I'll try to course correct as I continue to stream forward.
-MATT-
All right.
So moving on to the next--
-LIAM-
And I moo that out.
(whale call)
-MATT-
Continuing to push forward.
Everyone make another perception check.
-LIAM-
Come on, universe. Give me another one.
-TALIESIN-
Double one!
-LIAM-
Average.
-LAURA-
Two and three.
-MATT-
Nice, clerics bringing up the rear.
-SAM-
I got a 19.
-MARISHA-
I got a four.
-TALIESIN-
My eyes were closed.
-ASHLEY-
17.
-LIAM-
14.
-MATT-
17.
-TRAVIS-
Five.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
(whale calls)
-MATT-
You you heard what Caleb had disseminated throughout the water, though you do not understand.
Well, no, you are one of the whales, so you pick up on what he's saying, but you're all still losing it.
Like it's becoming hard to follow.
You're still at quite a distance from whatever this is, and you're starting to lose the trail a bit.
But you recall the direction you were traveling, and you continue push that way in hopes that you haven't been noticed or you can alter your path.
What would you like to do?
-LIAM-
I will stop mooing in the water, but go in the same direction.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Dragging the clerics as I go.
-MATT-
Same?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Are you continuing to fan out, or are you beginning to converge with Fjord and Caleb?
-ASHLEY-
So you've been communicating.
-LIAM-
I just now mooed out this way.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
"Follow me," and then I stopped talking.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to start making my way-- ♪ Making my way to Caleb. ♪
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Swimming over.
Also putting the tail out, making it look pretty to add to the show.
-MATT-
You got it, all right.
-MARISHA-
We got a fountain going.
-SAM-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
It's great.
-MATT-
Are you joining with this?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
So you guys are beginning to slowly bring your fanning pattern back together, moving on for another batch here.
This is interesting, okay.
Continuing to push forward, keeping down in this darker, 70 or so foot depth.
What little bit of light is coming through the clouds and the storm above is helping give a little bit of visibility to those of you who are relying on sight.
However, the rest of you, the hearing, it's very unique being underwater.
It's an odd sense of having awareness of much more space than what you're used to and picking up just shifting movement and sound and elements, and being able to understand a vague idea of the vicinity.
It's unique.
And hopefully it will be enough.
So I would need everyone here to go ahead and roll perception again. Once again, disadvantage for those of you who are not whales.
-LAURA-
I'm going to guide you, Caleb.
-LIAM-
Okay. Said it.
-TALIESIN-
20.
-LIAM-
And that's a d4?
-TALIESIN-
14.
-MATT-
14.
-MARISHA-
It's actually okay this time.
-SAM-
19 on the surface again.
-MARISHA-
20 on the surface this time.
-MATT-
Though your visibility is shitty, and since you're convening to join them, you guys are keeping out, and you see in the distance, more heavier ice floes.
In fact, the path you're heading right now looks to be a very clustered path of jagged, broken ice shelves.
-SAM-
Oh god.
-MATT-
And right as you realize this--
-SAM-
Oh god.
-MATT-
The rope pulls you underwater.
-MARISHA-
Hold your breath!
-SAM-
Well, we can't, we've got Water Walk on.
-LIAM-
You can drop it if you choose.
-MATT-
You can choose to drop it if you want to.
-TALIESIN-
No, you can just drop it.
-LAURA-
You've got a ring on, though.
-SAM-
He has to-- it's his.
-LIAM-
Matt said that the person with it on--
-MARISHA-
Does it force you from going underwater? Is it more like a life vest?
-TALIESIN-
No, it makes you buoyant.
-MATT-
It makes you buoyant.
It's less about the, you cannot break the surface.
It's just you're resisting it.
Which would be tough if you're being dragged through the water by an orca. It would slow her down.
-MARISHA-
Can I grab Veth and try and, like,
Can I grab Veth and try and, like, do some monk shit and maneuver around it and like pop pop pop pop pop over top of it?
-MATT-
How long is the rope you have?
-MARISHA-
30 feet-ish, I guess-
-MATT-
She is now going 60 feet underwater.
So either you have to hold onto the rope and go under the water with her or let go and try and run across the surface and the ice above.
It's your call.
-SAM-
What if we let go, run across, and then on the other side, we'll rejoin with her.
No.
-MARISHA-
Because I can, if it's a 30-foot rope, we're not necessarily at the end of the rope.
My dash speed is 100 feet.
Unless you want to hold your breath.
-SAM-
Can I even go under the water? I'm wearing a ring of water walking.
-ASHLEY-
You have underwater breathing.
-MATT-
In the same regard, if you wanted to will it to go under there, you could let the effect subside.
-LAURA-
Just go under-fucking-water.
Everybody can breathe.
-SAM-
Go underwater.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I clutch onto Veth for added protection.
-MATT-
All right, and in that moment, that moment of choose top or, you know, to go top route or underneath, you make the choice, and instinctually take a deep breath, though it will not matter before you both plunge beneath the surface.
-MARISHA-
All right, good to know.
-MATT-
All right.
perception checks?
-LAURA-
Oh yeah, we all rolled.
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
19.
-LAURA-
19.
-LIAM-
Dirty 20.
-SAM-
Mine was 19 on the surface.
-MATT-
Right.
-ASHLEY-
Seven.
-TALIESIN-
14.
-MARISHA-
20.
-MATT-
All right.
And now for you guys, perception checks with disadvantage, as a note, now that you're under the water.
You're picking up that sound of thrashing again.
You still can't quite pinpoint the specific direction, but you know it's loosely in front of you.
You feel like you're on the tail of it, to a degree.
If you can maintain some semblance of the same rolls, you'll continue to hone in on it.
If you don't, you'll begin to lose it.
So that brings us to...
You are slowly gaining at the moment.
Both...
Veth and Beauregard.
Both take six points of cold damage from the impact of the icy waters that you've been dragged underneath.
The rest of you, make your perception checks.
Well, you guys as well, make your perception checks but with disadvantage if you're not a whale.
-SAM-
One.
-MARISHA-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Another natural 20 that I get to burn, 16.
-MARISHA-
Natural one.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
21.
-MATT-
21. Nice.
-SAM-
It's darker under here.
-LIAM-
16.
-MATT-
16.
-LAURA-
Fail.
-MARISHA-
So fucking cold.
-TRAVIS-
19.
-MATT-
19.
All of you begin to lose the thrashing sound except for Yasha.
Yasha, you can pick up on it, and as you're honing in on it, you begin to see the intent and the drive from Yasha swimming and pulling you guys along into the water beneath.
It's beginning to dive a bit, and you watch Yasha beginning to go into a deeper trajectory, and you all can adjust with her, if you'd like.
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
I call out, too.
(whale call)
-TRAVIS-
(whale call)
-MATT-
I live for this.
-LIAM-
(creaking)
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
(creaking)
-TRAVIS-
Well, they do make those clicking sounds and stuff.
-MATT-
All right.
You're feeling like you're getting closer.
You're beginning to push more and more in that direction, as it gets deeper and deeper, the light begins to subside, and the two of you, you can barely see anything.
You can hear things better than you can see them almost, and the depths are freezing cold.
You both take four points of cold damage.
-TALIESIN-
You did take your 15 positive before we left the boat, right?
-MARISHA-
No, I did not.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
I did.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Before we left the boat?
-MATT-
He did a Mass Cure Wounds.
Everybody did heal 15 before you left.
-MARISHA-
That helps.
-LIAM-
How long have we been swimming for, like 10, 15, 20 minutes or something? 30 minutes?
-MATT-
At this point, it would be about, no, no, I'm going round by round by round here.
-LIAM-
Round by round, got it.
-MATT-
Because this is a distance travel, this is a you either win quickly or you lose quickly.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
So you are now in round seven.
-SAM-
Are we still rolling? We're still going at 120 feet per second?
-MATT-
Exactly.
-SAM-
Because we're using...
-LAURA-
Double double.
-LIAM-
Whale speed, dash.
-MATT-
Yeah, whale speed with a dash.
-SAM-
Doesn't that take an action?
-MATT-
It does.
-LIAM-
Yeah. Nobody's attacking.
-SAM-
But I mean, we're also rolling perception?
-MATT-
For this, it's just keeping an eye out and hearing.
This is more of just as you're swimming hard, you're just listening out for it.
-LIAM-
Yeah, it's different than investigation.
-MATT-
So perception checks for the whales, and perception checks for those who are underwater.
-SAM-
♪ Perception checks for the whales ♪
-TRAVIS-
Ooh.
-LIAM-
Dirty 20.
-MATT-
Dirty 20?
-TRAVIS-
20.
-MATT-
20.
-LAURA-
Did you take it?
-ASHLEY-
22.
-LIAM-
Did you give it to me?
-LAURA-
I didn't.
-LIAM-
No, I didn't.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
23.
-MARISHA-
21.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
That's a good round.
-MARISHA-
With disadvantage.
-LAURA-
19.
-MATT-
That's a very good round.
-SAM-
11.
-MATT-
All of you begin to pick up the sound of swimming and thrashing.
It is from a smaller source than the whales, and it begins to shift, like it's reacting to your presence, and is thrashing faster and with more intent.
Let's go ahead and move to the next round.
-SAM-
This is a thing.
-TRAVIS-
How much time has transpired, roughly?
-LIAM-
Forming an emotional bond.
-MATT-
You're under a minute.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Did really well.
-MARISHA-
Another round of perception?
-MATT-
Another round of perception, yeah.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-LAURA-
25.
-TRAVIS-
No fucking way.
-MATT-
Damn!
-TRAVIS-
Three of them? Wow!
-MATT-
You have rolled some 20s tonight.
-LIAM-
These are my dice. I'm never giving them up!
-TRAVIS-
Natural 20.
-LIAM-
Oh shit!
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
13.
-MATT-
13.
-MARISHA-
11.
-SAM-
Nine.
-TALIESIN-
25.
-MATT-
Okay.
That's more than half over 20.
You begin to make out from the source, and it is now diving deeper into the lightless depths below.
But you see a humanoid figure, currently swimming its way beneath the waters.
-LAURA-
How far away?
-MATT-
At the moment, it is 80 feet away from you.
-SAM-
Just a single human figure?
-MATT-
Single humanoid figure.
-SAM-
Whoa.
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt.
At 3rd-level.
-MATT-
Right now? Okay.
Go ahead, roll for attack with disadvantage.
-LAURA-
Is that okay?
-MARISHA-
Do it.
Yeah, highlights her.
-LIAM-
Yeah, love it.
Come on, cowgirl, get it.
-LAURA-
Damn it. Damn it.
No, that's 12.
-MATT-
12 misses, unfortunately.
It streaks by, but you all watch as this bead of bright light, like a firing flare of divine energy, just streaks into the depths below, and as it does, for a split second, you see the darkened, shadowed outline of what you assume is Avantika, ducking out, dodging out of the way, looking over and seeing this rapidly gaining pod of whales and the hitchhikers that currently clutch to the ropes making their way, bearing down upon her.
-LIAM-
You miss, but that's a fucking great visual.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it really is.
-MATT-
So, going into the next round.
-ASHLEY-
Some light.
-MARISHA-
This is crazy.
-SAM-
Matty, do we take another set of cold damage?
-MATT-
You do.
Take three cold damage.
-SAM-
Yay.
-TALIESIN-
How you guys holding up?
-MARISHA-
Fine.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MARISHA-
About half for me.
-SAM-
Me, too.
-MATT-
You are 20 feet from her.
-LAURA-
(gasps) 20 feet from her.
-SAM-
We can eat her.
-TRAVIS-
I can.
-LIAM-
Feeding frenzy.
-TRAVIS-
Can I use--
-MARISHA-
Do it.
-TRAVIS-
Can use my Relentless Hex as a bonus action to magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within five feet of the target cursed by your Hex spell?
-LIAM-
You have to drop your whale.
-MATT-
I will say, for the purposes of this and how the Hex is attuned to you, you would have to drop your whale form.
-LIAM-
Yeah, you're an underwater dude.
It's kind of cool.
-TRAVIS-
I'll drop it.
-MATT-
Okay.
You watch as one of the whale forms vanishes, and a secondary dark shadow of the captain, Fjord Stone, dives forth.
And then in a flash, you see just a few bubbles left behind and he's gone. As Avantika is diving down, suddenly in front of her, you appear, the blade glowing like this underwater torchlight
-TRAVIS-
Can I take two swings?
-MATT-
You can.
-LAURA-
Oh shit!
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
Get her!
-ASHLEY-
I love this game.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
That's 21 to hit.
-MATT-
21 misses.
(groaning)
-LIAM-
She's badass!
-TRAVIS-
She is.
That's 17 plus 12 is--
-SAM-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
29.
-MATT-
That hits.
Go ahead and roll damage on her.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-TRAVIS-
10-- (counting) 24 points of force damage.
-MATT-
From?
-TRAVIS-
One slash.
-MATT-
One slash, nice.
All right.
So she gets struck in the side.
As her mouth opens, no bubbles emerge.
She doesn't breathe air at the moment.
-TRAVIS-
Shocker.
-MATT-
She's going to use her reaction to do Hungry Swipe.
She's going to strike at you out with the dagger.
And that dagger is going to be a 21 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
That hits.
I will roll with my Armor of Hexes.
-MATT-
Your armor-- oh no, that's still lasting.
-TRAVIS-
And it's a four, so it misses.
-MATT-
Let's see here.
Well, this is the ninth round, and you cast the Hex-
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that does last a certain amount of time, doesn't it?
-MATT-
It lasts for 10 rounds, so it would not, so we'll say for the purposes of this, this is the last round it'll happen.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
We'll say it's the last round that you have a Hex.
-TRAVIS-
Okay (exhales)
-MATT-
So it misses.
The dagger swings wide, and at that point, the shadows dissipate from her body.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
The hex is no longer there.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
But you are both swimming in tandem now while you're both striking at each other as she's still trying to push away.
So, the next round, the whales will catch up.
Because she does not swim as fast as orcas.
So.
-TALIESIN-
Sacred Flame? Yeah, we'll wait till--
-MATT-
For the purposes of this, let's go ahead and roll, we don't need a battlefield here, but we can roll initiative to see what order people are going in.
-MARISHA-
A brand new initiative?
-MATT-
Brand new initiative.
-TALIESIN-
Hmm.
-LAURA-
Hmm.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Natural 20.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
So 25 total for Beau.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
Natural one.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
So five total for Jester.
-MATT-
There you go.
-MARISHA-
That natural 20 on literally any other thing this game.
-MATT-
All right, so, 25 to 20, we got Beau.
20 to 15?
-LIAM-
17.
-TALIESIN-
17.
-ASHLEY-
18.
-LAURA-
Ooh.
-MATT-
All right, then we have Caduceus and Caleb.
15 to 10?
-SAM-
14.
-MATT-
10 to five?
-LAURA-
Five.
Did you roll, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
I did.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
What'd you get?
-TRAVIS-
Four.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-TRAVIS-
No, two.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-MATT-
There you go.
All right, Beau, you're up first.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
I guess I'm going to yank on the rope and run along the back of Yasha whale, and then I'm going to kick off of Yasha whale's nose, do a forward flip, and then get to her, 50 feet of movement.
-MATT-
50 feet of movement halved, because you're underwater, so it's 25.
You were 20 feet from her, so you can get there.
-MARISHA-
So I can get there.
-MATT-
Because you're following them, so you can get there.
-MARISHA-
Okay, and I use a little bit of the current from Yasha whale as she-
-MATT-
You torpedo Beau towards--
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Headbutt.
-MARISHA-
That sounds fun.
I'm going to torpedo Beau headbutt.
-TRAVIS-
Do you slow down as you get there and like (thunk)?
-MATT-
I just envision Robin Williams in the Popeye movie when he torpedo-Popeyes into the octopus at the end.
There you go.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
I bonk her her a little bit, but then I do the five-inch punch, and then--
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
I think it's a one-inch punch.
-MATT-
Roll your attacks. Your attacks all have--
-MARISHA-
One-inch punch, whatever.
-SAM-
It's five times as good.
-MATT-
Your attacks are all disadvantage because you are underwater.
-MARISHA-
Disadvantage.
All right, so first attack.
22?
-MATT-
22 misses.
-MARISHA-
22 misses.
Second attack.
Misses.
-TALIESIN-
22.
-MATT-
You go in, about to touch, and you one-inch punch, and she just darts out of the way.
She's pretty comfortable under the water.
And you go for a second strike, and she moves out of the way again.
You get your bonus.
-MARISHA-
Fucking irritated.
Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
You're not the only dodge tank in the world.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
I'm just going to resort to bar brawl 18-year old Beau and start clawing and try and grab at her coat.
-MATT-
You got it.
-MARISHA-
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ah! Oh, oh, yay, okay.
27?
-MATT-
27 hits.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I grab her hoops.
15?
-MATT-
15 damage, or to hit?
-MARISHA-
15 damage.
-MATT-
Okay, continue.
-MARISHA-
On that first one.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right.
-MARISHA-
Next one, disadvantage.
No, that's a one and a six.
-MATT-
Okay, you do get one hit off.
You hit her off in the temple.
-MARISHA-
Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
You know she's immune to stunning.
-MARISHA-
She's immune to stunning, I know she's immune to stunning.
-MATT-
I will allow you to not spend that point because you would know.
-MARISHA-
I know that already.
I pull her hair, feels like all I got.
-MATT-
Sure, it comes free.
-ALL-
(groaning)
-MATT-
With relative ease.
-ALL-
Ew!
-MATT-
Her hat is gone and there is now a chunk of exposed skull where you tugged at it.
-MARISHA-
A little bit of a flesh and bone attached to it?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That's cool.
-MATT-
All righty. That finishes Beau's go, Yasha, you are going simultaneously with Avantika.
What's your dexterity?
-ASHLEY-
16.
-MATT-
I will say Avantika actually goes a little bit before you.
-ASHLEY-
That's fine.
-MATT-
So.
-ASHLEY-
Ladies first.
-MATT-
In proximity with Beau and Fjord, Fjord's going to be the source of her frustration.
Even though you just pulled her hair out.
She's like, "Whatever." You're the one that she has some history to deal with.
-TRAVIS-
Just a little bit.
-MATT-
So after the hair tugs off a bit, her head snaps in your direction with a horrible whipping and clicking into position.
The head still tilted to one side, the eyes still glowing with that odd yellow, the pupil isn't even visible now.
You just see these yellow glow, the same glow you recall from any dreams you had with Uk'otoa over the past year.
-SAM-
(whispering) Uk'otoa.
-MATT-
The rapier comes out to strike at you with the first strike.
That is going to an 18 to hit?
-TRAVIS-
It hits.
-MATT-
It hits.
With that, the rapier does 14 points of piercing damage to you.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, 14.
As it strikes you, the blood (pfff) out there, and you feel this cold sensation in the wound, and you watch this dull glow down the rapier, like it pulled energy out of you.
-TALIESIN-
Ah, fucker.
-MATT-
The glow goes into her and she's pulsing within her torso ever so gently.
She's going to now strike with the dagger as her offhand before she goes in for the secondary rapier attack.
So the dagger strike is going to be 20 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Hits.
-MATT-
You take 10 points of piercing damage.
And as the dagger cuts through your midsection, necrotic energy suddenly pierces into the wound that it leaves behind, dealing in additional 11 points of necrotic damage to you.
And she pulls back with the rapier for now her third and final strike, and goes to pierce you a third time.
Oh, that is a 30 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
I think it hits.
-TALIESIN-
Jesus.
-TRAVIS-
Think it hit.
-MATT-
You take 16 points of piercing damage.
And as the blade sticks into you, that glow that she pulled out of you charges through the arm, through the rapier, and into the wound, and then bursts on the inside.
You feel this horrible burning sensation, like a portion of your soul is being charred on the inside, as she uses her Soul Burn ability.
-TRAVIS-
Soul Burn.
-MATT-
She seems to be able to draw out elements of somebody's soul and then redirect it.
So you take from that...
-TRAVIS-
It's me, soul, don't hurt me.
-LAURA-
You know me, soul.
-TRAVIS-
Soul knows the way.
-MATT-
28 points in necrotic damage.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!
-TALIESIN-
How you doing, buddy?
-MATT-
And she's going to continue-- she's going to stay put, because she's currently now in a defensive position between the two of you, and it starting to feel a little confident on now that she's brought you into her favored terrain, if you will.
All right, that's going to finish Avantika's go.
Yasha, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
As a whale.
-ASHLEY-
Can I just try to go chomp on her?
-MATT-
Yeah, go for it!
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Do I just-- it's a--
-LIAM-
Attack roll.
You could either try to damage her or choose instead to grapple her.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I want to...
-MATT-
Your call.
-ASHLEY-
I mean, I want to do damage and grapple.
But it's just one attack because it's a whale?
-MATT-
Yeah.
You get one attack. It's a bite.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
So I'm just going to bite and hold her down.
-MATT-
Yeah, so go ahead and roll an attack and six to the attack roll.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Wait.
Yeah, go ahead. No, I'm sorry, sorry.
I'm doing math in my head.
-ASHLEY-
20 total.
-MATT-
20 total.
Unfortunately, as you swing by, she just ducks beneath and skids across the blubber as you dive and curl around, unable to find purchase with your teeth.
-TRAVIS-
17 or higher.
-TALIESIN-
Well, 22 misses on her.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Killer whales aren't going to do shit.
-MATT-
Unless you roll really high. I don't know.
-TALIESIN-
Unless we roll really high.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes Yasha's go.
Caduceus and Caleb, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
Natural dice roll of 17 or higher. Maybe.
-TALIESIN-
You can go first.
-LIAM-
I'm just going to try to bite her and hurt her.
Long shot.
23
-MATT-
23 does hit.
Roll damage on that.
That just hits.
-MARISHA-
Wow. Okay.
-LIAM-
24 points of piercing damage.
-SAM-
Whoa.
-MATT-
Nice.
So, as she ducks out of the way of Yasha swishing by, she prepares herself to focus between the dueling stance of between Beauregard and Fjord.
And without realizing, she looks down just in time to see this giant angry orca maw come up from beneath and close on her leg.
She pushes off and kicks out of your mouth.
But she does, there's a stream of dark liquid, long coagulated blood now released into the water around her, leaving a dark cloud around the outside of her torso
-LIAM-
♪ Fanta, Fanta, don't you want a ♪
-MATT-
All righty.
That finishes Caleb's go.
Caduceus?
-TALIESIN-
I'm keeping a little bit of distance.
Just like, not a ton of distance, but I'm going to Sacred Flame at this point.
-MATT-
Okay, you got it.
What's the same on that?
-TALIESIN-
It's a dex save.
-MATT-
Dex save. She's good at those.
That is a 27.
-TALIESIN-
Motherfucker.
Okay, good to know.
-MATT-
All right, so as you release Sacred Flame, it flares, but where it flares, she's suddenly not there.
It seems like the spell itself-- she almost seems to deflect the spell and use that deflection energy to vanish from her spot and teleport 30 feet towards you.
-TALIESIN-
Did that actually work?
-MATT-
It did.
-TALIESIN-
So she's no longer grappled?
-MATT-
She's no longer grappled.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MATT-
Well, I don't think she was grappled previously.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, she was just bit.
-MATT-
She was just bit.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MATT-
But suddenly, she vanishes.
-TALIESIN-
Still 30 feet away from me.
-MATT-
Seems that directed spells, she has another trick up her sleeve.
-TALIESIN-
Cool to know.
-MATT-
So now she's pretty close to you.
Within a short distance, she can get to you.
All right, that finishes your go, Caduceus.
Veth, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.
-LAURA-
Wait, what did she just do?
-SAM-
So where she--
-TALIESIN-
She teleported 30 feet towards me because I did a direct spell.
-MATT-
He did a spell towards her, the flame burst.
And as it did is she almost seemed to push it to the side and then vanish and then appear 30 feet closer to Caduceus.
-LAURA-
Oh wow.
-SAM-
So how far is she from <i>moi</i>?
-MATT-
From you? Since you were riding by, holding on to Beauregard and dropped behind. If you were holding onto the rope still.
You could have let go and be within 50 feet of her.
-SAM-
Okay.
Boy oh boy.
This is so confusing.
-MATT-
Also, Beauregard and Veth, you both take six points of cold damage.
-SAM-
Okay, great, great, great.
Not so much I can do.
Is she engaged with anyone?
-MATT-
At the moment, no, she teleported away.
-SAM-
Damn it.
And it's pointless to shoot a crossbow at her.
I mean, it's not pointless.
-LIAM-
She's not up at Caddy right now?
-LAURA-
She's 30 feet away from him.
-LIAM-
30 feet from Caddy, got it.
-MATT-
And 30 feet away from you.
-SAM-
I've got nowhere to hide.
I'll do the same fucking thing again.
I will cast Phantasmal Force at her.
-MATT-
Okay, and it is intelligence, right?
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
That is a natural one.
-LAURA-
Ah, thank you!
-SAM-
Okay.
Uh.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't expect that to work.
(laughter) Fjord's holding his sword, right?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
Okay, I will, through force of...
my charisma-- no, I will make her believe that Fjord's sword is the orb.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Ooh, like he stole it away from her when they were fighting?
-MATT-
Okay, so as she darts towards Caduceus and takes stock of the vicinity she glances back towards you and her face goes (gasps) wide.
Suddenly she glances towards her belt and back towards you.
Okay, that's your turn.
-SAM-
That's it, that's all I got.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right, that brings us to Jester.
Fjord, you're on deck.
-LAURA-
What does what does Phantasmal Force do?
-SAM-
It makes her believe something.
-LAURA-
It's not like a charm spell, where if I attack her it's going to to break the illusion?
-SAM-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Huh?
-TALIESIN-
Paying attention to some shit.
All right, making plan, sorry.
-LIAM-
She just sicced Avantika back on Fjord essentially.
-LAURA-
Right.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
And how far away am I from everybody? I guess I was holding onto Caleb, so I'm up with--
-MATT-
You're holding onto Caleb.
You're, right now, I'd say, about 40 feet from Avantika and you guys are all pretty clustered in this little orb that was around her before she teleported out.
-LAURA-
Okay, so I can't get to <i>her</i>.
How's everybody doing?
-SAM-
(underwater noises) It's cold down here.
-LAURA-
I'm going to-- (squeals) (exhales)
-SAM-
Is this how hard it is for you to heal someone?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
(exhaling)
I am going to...
-SAM-
You will cast Healing Word.
-TRAVIS-
Each new opportunity is a chance to not fuck up.
And it sucks for you, too.
I've been doing it all day.
-LAURA-
I can't, I can't use my-- it's my 7th-level spell! Are we that low on health?
-TRAVIS-
No, not yet.
-LAURA-
Okay, then I'm not going to do it.
-LIAM-
Orca power.
-LAURA-
Okay, then I'm going to just 3rd-level...
3rd-level, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt her again.
-MATT-
Go for it. Roll for an attack.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-MATT-
Because you're close, you do not have disadvantage on the attack.
-ASHLEY-
Kill 'er!
-TRAVIS-
Whale!
-LAURA-
(grumbles) (blows raspberry)
Oh! 28!
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
(cheering) That's 6d6, okay.
And the next attack against her has advantage.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
She is a bright, shiny beacon to be piñata-ed here beneath the ocean.
-LAURA-
(grumbles) Five, six.
11, 15, 19 points.
-MATT-
19 points of damage, nice.
So as you release this blast, it shoots through, once again, like a divine torpedo blasting her in the side.
And as it does, you watch as it burns up the side, almost ignoring the fact that you're underwater for a brief moment and you see flames, their own divine nature just pushing through the water like it's just air and singeing up the side of her body.
As it burns there, you all have this bright open view of Avantika giving off this radius of bright light around her.
That finish your turn?
-LAURA-
Um, y-y-yes.
-MATT-
Okay. Fjord, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
I'll take two swings.
-MARISHA-
Do it.
-MATT-
Okay.
You have to move 30 feet to swim up to her, though.
-TRAVIS-
She moved away, right?
-MATT-
Correct.
Does your armor allow you to swim?
-TRAVIS-
Mariner's Breastplate.
-MATT-
Yeah, you still have the breastplate, so yeah, you can catch up to her 30 feet.
You can totally do that.
-MARISHA-
Come on, come on.
Poetry in motion.
-TRAVIS-
There's got to be one in the day right? That's 29.
-SAM-
Yes!
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-TRAVIS-
'Kay.
-MARISHA-
(quietly) Come on.
-TRAVIS-
That's 13 points.
-MATT-
13 points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Second one.
-MATT-
Second strike.
-TRAVIS-
This is just regular, right?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Yeah, that is regular strike.
-TRAVIS-
It's 28.
-MATT-
28 hits again.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to pump a Divine Smite into this.
-MARISHA-
Yes, you will.
-MATT-
That's right, because you still have paladin spell levels.
-MARISHA-
Do it.
-TRAVIS-
Five, 12, 14 plus 2d8.
-MATT-
3d8, because she is undead.
-TRAVIS-
She <i>is</i> undead.
Fuck.
What did I say, 14? What was the first one, 14 points?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
That's eight, 16, 20.
34 points of damage.
-MATT-
34 points of damage.
How do you want to do this? (cheering)
-TRAVIS-
Oh man.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-LAURA-
Oh my god!
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
I'll swim up to her, and on the first strike it turns her, and on the second one, as I bring the sword back around, you see yellow energy shimmer from the water around Fjord and it collects and runs up through him and the runes pulse on the Star Razor.
-MATT-
You all watch as the runes pulse upon the Star Razor, the blade itself seems to almost extend an additional inch and a half.
You watch as additional runes that previously were not visible on the blade begin to appear on the outer edge of the base of the blade.
-TRAVIS-
What?! I was just making that shit up!
-MATT-
Continue.
-TRAVIS-
They pulse. Fjord's yellow eyes flash, because fuck Uk'otoa.
(explosion) And just bisect her.
-MATT-
As the blade impacts and cuts through the body, you just see the swing.
All the energy streaks through, and there's a moment where it's just calm and still in the darkness below.
Avantika doesn't react.
The blade itself now goes dark.
And you watch as the center of the chest, a thin line of white light appears.
Her head lolls down towards it.
And looks back up towards you.
And as she opens her mouth, the inside of her mouth is glowing with that same light.
(explosion) As it bursts, completely sending the upper part of her torso and lower half of her body scattering from each other as in the middle of this space.
It's like when you see a depth charge explode.
There's a-- (explosion) under the water.
Before it-- vanishes there.
Leaving the two parts of her just setting adrift, lifeless and un-lifeless, in the dark depths.
-LAURA-
Go get the orb, go get the orb.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I swim.
I swim down to her lower half.
Find whatever knapsack or pocket she was putting it in and search for it.
-MATT-
Roll an investigation check.
-TRAVIS-
Oh god, please have it.
-LAURA-
Otherwise we just have to take her whole body.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Her body has taken quite a beating in the past few rounds.
-TRAVIS-
24.
-MATT-
24.
As you rush up towards the body, you glance over and watch, the jostling of the impact has torn free the orb.
-LAURA-
(quietly) Oh my god.
-MATT-
But as it begins to plummet, you catch it.
-TRAVIS-
I just hold it for a second.
I look over at everyone.
Including a shitload of whales.
-LIAM-
(whale call)
-TRAVIS-
I look at Caleb's giant albino and cream colored killer whale.
-SAM-
Like an Orange Julius.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to hold onto this for a little bit, if you don't mind, and I will put it in the Bag of Holding.
Are there any other reinforcements of hers that were coming?
-MATT-
Perception check.
-TRAVIS-
We've been chasing, I'm pretty sure.
That's a two.
-TALIESIN-
We should run.
-MATT-
You look pretty alone.
And by the way, Fjord and Nott-- Veth take two points of cold damage.
-MARISHA-
Did you mean Beau?
-MATT-
Beau, I mean, sorry.
-TRAVIS-
And me too, now.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah, we should get back.
-MATT-
Yeah, and you as well because you're no longer an orca.
-TALIESIN-
Really quick, I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds for everybody.
Who needs it? Not the whales, I suppose--
-MARISHA-
I'll take it.
-TALIESIN-
One, two, three, four, five.
Everyone else is fine.
-LIAM-
(whale noises)
-TALIESIN-
Are any whales hurt?
-LIAM-
(whale noises)
-SAM-
No whales were hurt in this-- (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
No whales were hurt in this film.
-TALIESIN-
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, that sucked sucked, six.
-SAM-
What?
-TALIESIN-
16 healing to everyone.
-LAURA-
That's great.
-MATT-
All right.
The cold is taking its toll on those who are not protected from the elements.
As you are healed by Caduceus, the whales begin to to gather the party that needs some assistance to swim.
And you hear new sounds in the water around you.
(whale calls) Other orcas seem to have called upon the sounds you have been making and the call to join.
And as you begin to make your way up back to the surface of the water, you watch as they tear into the remains of Avantika.
A very easy, scavenged meal.
-TRAVIS-
And her sword and dagger have fallen right?
-MATT-
They have begun to sink, unless one of you wants to try and catch them before they reach the bottom of the ocean.
-TRAVIS-
I wouldn't mind trying.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I'll do a dash.
So 60 feet or whatever, yeah.
-MATT-
I will say, this is going to be a perception check.
You have darkvision?
-TRAVIS-
I do.
-MATT-
That'll help. So just make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. That's...
18.
-MATT-
18, okay.
You grab the dagger.
Go ahead and roll for the other weapon.
-TRAVIS-
Perception for this?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Can I cast Enhance Abil-- oh, it's touch.
-TRAVIS-
19.
-MATT-
19.
You also grab the rapier.
You have them both.
Yeah, those are really good perception checks.
So you have both the weapons.
You can put them in your Bag of Holding and begin to catch up with the rest of them.
I'll probably take another--
Oh, you do. Everyone takes-- Actually, that was way too many dice, I don't know why I did that.
Three points of cold damage to the lot of you. But you will-- If you guys are waiting for Fjord? Or are you heading up to the surface?
-LAURA-
We'll wait for Fjord.
-MARISHA-
I grab-- I'm going to go up.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to wait for Fjord.
-TALIESIN-
I'll wait.
-MARISHA-
I'll grab Veth and we like, go for the water walking buoyancy, try and get up.
-MATT-
You both take three more points of cold damage before you reach the surface.
Fjord returns with the weapons and takes another five.
And the rest of you begin to make your way to the icy crest of the ocean.
A little ways away from the ship, but you still have two orcas that can pull the rest of the crew.
And you're only a little over a thousand feet away from the Midnight Hammer.
So you manage to drag the rest of the party to the outskirts of the boat to where you see the crew remaining, including Captain Kem, whose ears are dripping a little bit of blood from the scream earlier, glances over the side and goes, "All right, so you made some friends, where's the rest of you?"
-MARISHA-
They're coming.
-SAM-
This <i>is</i> the rest of-- I mean, yeah.
-MARISHA-
They're whales.
-MATT-
"Throw the ladder over." And they throw two of the metallic chain ladders over the side that clink down and then splash into the water below.
Those who wish to could drop their orca form, but eventually you all climb your way back onto the deck of the ship.
-LIAM-
Not net yet, first killer whale bumps Jester a little too hard.
(whale call) And if you've ever seen a killer whale, like a giant aquatic creature, like, do a big toothy smile? (whale call)
-LAURA-
Oh, I do that thing where they reach in and they pet the tongue.
(laughter)
-SAM-
You gotta do a--
-LIAM-
(blowing forcefully)
-MATT-
There it is.
-ASHLEY-
There you go.
Big boy.
-LIAM-
(whoosh) Oh.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-LIAM-
<i>Scheiße</i>, the water is cold.
-TRAVIS-
Y'all are special.
-MARISHA-
Caduceus, can you start boiling some water for tea? Like, right now?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, I'm going to take this stuff off, and put on something dry and then start the kettle.
-LAURA-
Take the rod of hand-warming.
-MARISHA-
Oh yes, thank you!
-LAURA-
Everybody huddle around the rod of hand-warming.
-TRAVIS-
That mage was swallowed, right? Eaten whole?
-LAURA-
Yeah, Caleb ate him.
-LIAM-
I ate him, he'll come out later.
-SAM-
Oh god.
-LIAM-
I think.
-SAM-
How does that work?
-LIAM-
I'm not entirely sure.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
If the crystal that he had happens to make its way out that would be useful.
-MATT-
So if we are going specifically into the details of what happens when somebody eats something and then polymorphs back.
-LIAM-
Yes, yes we are Matt.
-MATT-
I didn't detail at the time because we were in the middle of the rush for the narrative, but when you transformed, in the process of transforming back, you regurgitate the remains of what you had devoured.
-LAURA-
Ew!
-LIAM-
(retches)
-MATT-
So there is a pulverized corpse of whatever that strange fish humanoid creature was sitting frozen on the upper deck of the ship.
-LAURA-
Oh good.
-TALIESIN-
Do we want to interrogate it later or no?
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to go look for the, um-- try and investigate and find that crystal that he used to search for the Cloven Crystal.
-MATT-
Okay, make an investigation check.
-LAURA-
I'm going to run up to Fjord and enhance his abilities to do so.
-MATT-
Okay, so advantage on your investigation check.
-TRAVIS-
21.
-MATT-
21.
Sifting through the thoroughly trashed remains of this creature.
It is just a pile of chum.
But you find within one of its torn satchels a small orange-ish crystal.
It looks cloudy towards the base and then comes to more of a glassy finish at one of its a jagged natural points.
But that is what you recall him pulling out when he arrived.
-TRAVIS-
I'll scoop some like, sleety snow off of the railing of the ship.
Kind of wash it off and hold it up and show Caleb.
This is what they used.
I don't know if you can divine anything from it to use it, but.
-LIAM-
Probably so, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Got a lot of things for you to look at.
-LIAM-
You picked up some toys down below as well? Can I take a look at those?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'll take out the rapier and the dagger and lay them on the deck.
-MATT-
Interesting point.
When you pulled the rapier forth, you recall when Avantika was wielding it and striking you it had that twisted, tentacle-like design along the central blade, and there was a really intricate, barnacle-encrusted handle to it.
When you pull it from the the bag, it's just a plain rapier.
-TRAVIS-
This looks different than it did before.
-LIAM-
King's blessing.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe there's a way to activate it or unlock it, or maybe it's bereft of all the power.
I think the power was inside her all along.
(laughter)
That's very positive of you, Caduceus.
-LIAM-
Probably the blessing of your former master.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-LIAM-
Rotten down into it.
-TRAVIS-
I'm assuming that because, while it was hidden in your necklace, it wasn't necessarily off or out of this plane, they were able to locate it.
The Bag of Holding is another plane, a pocket dimension, right?
-LIAM-
Yeah, we should probably think of a more-- that's the short term solution, yeah? But we should think of a long-term, like perhaps visiting Yussa when we have free time.
When do we have free time? And perhaps deposit within the Heirloom Sphere.
-TRAVIS-
There's another idea.
Yasha?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Would you take a swing at this fucking orb and see what happens?
-ASHLEY-
It would be my pleasure.
-TALIESIN-
Do you have the power to do that right now?
-MARISHA-
She was able to smash that bowl back in the day.
-LIAM-
Everybody back up a few steps.
-SAM-
Magician's Judge.
-TRAVIS-
I had wanted to hold onto this because it's always better to hold the last key than to open up the possibilities of it being reformed or remade and then out of our control.
But this is the second time that you all have been put in danger and we don't seem to be on a-- I don't know, it just seems like a better equation if it's out of it.
-SAM-
Sure.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to Bless you before you do this.
-LIAM-
See what happens, if it's possible.
What it means.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, that's an extra d4.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Which one do I do?
-MATT-
So are you striking the Cloven Crystal?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
With...?
-ASHLEY-
With Magician's Judge.
-MATT-
All right, do you set it in the center of the deck here on the top of the ship or you could do it below decks? What do you do?
-LAURA-
We should do it below deck, probably.
So it doesn't bounce away and fall into the water.
-TRAVIS-
Actually, are there any of those floating glaciers outside of the ship?
-MATT-
The ship has been slowly moving.
You glance over, it's a little sporadic but there are a handful of floating ice sheets.
-TALIESIN-
It may get away if it's on the ocean.
-TRAVIS-
I just don't want it to explode and ruin the ship.
-TALIESIN-
I think maybe we wait.
-LIAM-
I have to remind us of one very important detail, too.
-MARISHA-
I walk around and I start picking up all the fireworks.
-LIAM-
That's it, the deck is covered in-- (laughter) two shopping carts worth of fireworks.
-MATT-
I was waiting for one errant Fireball.
-LIAM-
Oh, I was aware the whole time.
Well aware the entire time.
-TRAVIS-
All I could think of were horcruxes and those things never go quietly.
-MARISHA-
You just see Beau passing in the background just with a tender's amount of--
-LIAM-
If things had really gone south I was just going to use a fire cantrip and be like-- (whooshes) (fireworks noises)
-ASHLEY-
You know, I've remembered why.
I think we used Dispel Magic with Magician's Judge with that bowl.
-LAURA-
You did.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Let's try it again.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, let's try it again.
-LIAM-
Wait, hold on one moment.
-MATT-
Yeah?
-LIAM-
Everybody except for Yasha gather around me.
And I'm going to pull out a small glass bead and roll it in my hand three or four, five times, and then pull my hands apart and the bead floats between my hands and then shatters and a seemingly glass shimmering sphere forms that goes in 10 feet in every direction around me.
-MATT-
And this is...?
-LIAM-
This is Globe of Invulnerability.
-MATT-
Globe of Invulnerability?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
So just, I don't know if this is anything, but come closer, please. As you were, Yasha.
-MARISHA-
Stick my foot out and scoop another firework into it.
There we go, we're good.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Explorers.
-ASHLEY-
Here we go, big money.
-TALIESIN-
Plus the d4.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
That would be 23.
-MATT-
23, okay.
As you all watch, Yasha takes a breath, holds the blade in front of her, and with expected, but still incredible speed and might she arcs down with a giant scream and as it hits, there is a flash and spark.
And there the blade sits atop an untouched orb that has been pushed about a half an inch into the wood.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-MATT-
And as she pulls the blade back, it appears to be unscathed.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-TALIESIN-
Some things just can't be undone.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
We have to find a way to destroy it though.
There's got to be a way.
-TRAVIS-
Or lock it away as Caleb suggested.
I mean, we can always try and hit it harder, but you hit it pretty fucking hard.
-TALIESIN-
I think the ball is the-- it's the right plan.
-SAM-
We also have Vess DeRogna to seal it away or hide it or something.
-TRAVIS-
I don't really trust her with something this--
-LIAM-
No.
-SAM-
All right, all right.
-TALIESIN-
Keep it in the bag for now.
-TRAVIS-
I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding. Thank you, Yasha.
-ASHLEY-
I gave it a good try.
-TALIESIN-
Put it in the ball when it's time, throw it into the Astral Sea.
-TRAVIS-
I'm sorry this is the second time this has happened.
I need to close the chapter on a few things before it endangers us a third time.
Not sure how or when, but I'll try.
-MARISHA-
I have a feeling an opportunity will present itself.
-LIAM-
Yeah, now we know.
For now, put it in that bag.
That should do for now.
Short term, short term.
-TRAVIS-
In the beginning, when she came over the deck she wasn't even focused on the Cloven Crystal.
She was trying to pull <i>me</i>.
I would love to think that was just the personal side of her trying to get vengeance or payback.
I just can't put <i>myself</i> in a Bag of Holding.
-LAURA-
Do you think Uk'otoa will come after <i>you</i>?
-TRAVIS-
It certainly feels that way.
We'll think about it another time.
We have things we need to do.
And perhaps <i>that</i> we can make Vess DeRogna aware of, just that there are outside parties looking and we'll try to be more careful.
-SAM-
Odds are good that Uk'otoa won't come, like, today, probably.
-LAURA-
He's still sealed away.
He has to have people doing things for him and you killed his, like, top henchman.
-TRAVIS-
We've done it once before.
There was not a second attempt the first time.
So I would assume we have some time.
-LIAM-
In the meantime, if you want, you can have this.
Caleb holds up the medallion that he wore for so long.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, is that the no-scrying--?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Correct.
-TRAVIS-
N-- no. You--
-LIAM-
I haven't been wearing it for weeks.
-TRAVIS-
Why?
-MARISHA-
We're traveling with Vess DeRogna.
-LAURA-
The Assembly knows where he is.
-LIAM-
It's time to put it away.
It's been extraneous for a very long time.
If they wanted to kill me, they could have looked for one of you.
The moment that I decided to hitch my wagon to the Mighty Nein, this became obsolete.
But, not so for your scaly friend, perhaps.
-MARISHA-
He's right.
-TALIESIN-
It's a good idea.
-LIAM-
Think about it.
And I throw it.
-TRAVIS-
I catch it.
I'll take it.
-SAM-
He misses, it falls over the deck.
-MARISHA-
Oh, shit!
-LIAM-
I turn into a squid.
-TRAVIS-
I know how much this meant to you.
It was basically a part of you.
Feels strange to have changed places with you in some small way.
-LIAM-
I resented it as well.
So be careful.
-TRAVIS-
I'll put it on.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Do I need to attune to it?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-LIAM-
That's the thing.
-TALIESIN-
Oh that, oh yep, water on, hold on.
I'm going to run and go get the kettle.
-SAM-
Oh, the tea.
-LAURA-
The tea.
-MATT-
Okay, as you head down to bring in to prepare tea you can see us sitting at a table beneath the decks, currently enjoying a cup of tea already prepared for herself is Lady Vess DeRogna.
-TALIESIN-
I had special stuff, but I'm glad you got into that already.
-MATT-
"Oh, my apologies.
Am I to hear that you've already had quite an adventure?"
-TALIESIN-
That is a long conversation, but yeah.
It seems to have turned out all right.
-MATT-
"That is why I hired you."
-TALIESIN-
We come with some baggage on occasion.
-MATT-
"Don't we all?"
-TALIESIN-
We handled it.
-MATT-
"Don't we all?" And she gets up and takes the tea cup for herself and gives a nod and walks back to her chambers.
-TALIESIN-
You see what we're drinking later and you want some, just let-- oh, you're fine, okay.
I'm going to run up and give everyone hot water cups.
I was going to save this for later, I have more, but I figured we're celebrating.
This was a good day, technically.
I pull out these little dark brown, muddied-looking stones that are speckled with color.
And I pop one in everybody's hot water cup and they begin to dissolve and tiny little marshmallows pop out.
(gasping) It's hot chocolate.
When we went to get some, I just had to buy it.
-TRAVIS-
Hot chocolate bombs?
-TALIESIN-
I've got a bunch of them.
I spent a gold on this stuff.
I got some tea, too, but I was like.
-LAURA-
Caduceus, this is the most amazing thing you've ever done.
-TALIESIN-
Only when we do really good stuff, okay?
-ASHLEY-
It changes, it keeps going and then all the marshmallows came.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, there's a bunch of different flavors.
I got a variety pack.
-ASHLEY-
It's delicious!
-LAURA-
Let's fight Avantika every day! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Oh, let's not, but yeah.
-MARISHA-
Because I have too many incenses, it's a celebration.
I go to the bow of the ship and pop up a few.
(laughter)
-MATT-
(small explosions)
-MARISHA-
And I light them.
Just have a little cruise ship and hot chocolate.
-MATT-
As you guys look over-- and because while the storm itself has somewhat lessened, it's less majestic fireworks, more like muffled bursts and flashes of color in the above clouds and fog.
But it is still very beautiful.
-LAURA-
I just focus steam up.
-LIAM-
While you're shooting them off, too, Caleb's got his hot chocolate just on one finger.
And he's just reliving his C-Rex moment going like-- (laughter)
-MATT-
Enjoying your day of celebration.
You continue for the rest of the day's travel without issue.
Let's see how we can do for the rest of this journey.
Are you still rolling a d10?
-TRAVIS-
I'm not rolling those anymore.
-LIAM-
Come on, Cap'n.
Yeah, you are, we're on the open sea.
-TRAVIS-
Can't roll a one again, right?
-LAURA-
If you roll a one again, does that mean we have to fight Avantika again?
-MATT-
You'll find out what happens if you roll the same number.
-LIAM-
Now one is Dashilla.
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Dashilla.
-MATT-
It's just the ocean rogues gallery, just coming back.
-TRAVIS-
Listen, motherfucker.
If you want to be the only d10 in this tray, don't fuck me.
Seven.
-LIAM-
Lucky seven.
-MATT-
The next day is a fair day's travel.
Without issue, you progress onward un-attacked by terrifying entities from beneath the waves.
With only five days left of your journey, go ahead and roll for the next day.
-MARISHA-
Five days left.
-TRAVIS-
Three.
-LIAM-
A three hour tour.
-MATT-
Three, clear weather and exuberant crew make for rapid time minus one day to your journey.
So you actually make two days of travel on that journey.
-MARISHA-
Make up some time.
-MATT-
Make up a little bit of time.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I'll attune to the amulet and I'll take off the...
ring of fire resistance.
-LIAM-
Oh!
-SAM-
That you just bought?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, priorities.
-TALIESIN-
I'm proud of you.
-SAM-
Well, we'll switch them up when we get to land.
-MATT-
Does your Mariner's armor require attunement?
-TRAVIS-
It does not.
I have a cloak of protection, the ring of fire resistance, and the Star Razor.
-MATT-
Fair enough. Yeah, that does it.
So three more days of travel.
If anyone else wants to accomplish anything before--
-SAM-
I'm going to try to sweet talk some of the crew into giving me-- are there cannons on the ship or is it just the ballista?
-MATT-
It's just the ballista.
There are no cannons.
-SAM-
Damn. Forget it.
-MATT-
Fair enough.
-LAURA-
I'm going to spend one of those days scrying on Molly again.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Oh, I'm finishing out any-- I can't remember if I did or not-- all my spell scroll homework.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
So absorbed two spells in this.
-MATT-
You have enough time to do that without issue, yeah.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Oh my god.
-MATT-
As you attempt--
-LAURA-
I just remembered Sprinkle was in my hood the whole time.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I feel like Sprinkle was back in the boat the whole time.
-LAURA-
Can we say he was on the boat?
-TALIESIN-
I think so.
-LIAM-
Maybe at the last second, you just hucked him back on deck.
-MARISHA-
That water is two degrees celsius.
-TRAVIS-
To be fair, Underwater Breathing can be on up to 10 people, so.
-LAURA-
No, he would die from the cold.
-LIAM-
I mean, Otter Pops are really good.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-TRAVIS-
(high-pitched Sprinkle voice) Let it be now.
-MATT-
Let's say for the purposes of the narrative, Sprinkle, not being a fan of the cold ocean, leapt from your shoulders before you leapt overboard.
-LAURA-
I like it.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
(Sprinkle voice) Never return.
(laughter)
-MATT-
In concentrating, in sitting below decks, setting up your ritual to reach out to the whereabouts of Mollymauk and focusing, the Traveler comes, Artagan, taking your hands.
-LAURA-
Sprinkle sitting in the corner, going, "Fuck you." (laughter)
-MATT-
You're just like, "Uh." You focus for a moment and the path is cloudy.
After a few seconds further pushing there is resistance and the Traveler whispers in your ear, "Terribly sorry, dear.
It seems that he's a bit slippery today."
-LAURA-
Oh no.
Do you think he's onto us?
-MATT-
"I couldn't tell you that, but do know the divination does not always succeed.
Magic is imperfect at distances, but perhaps another day."
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
Okay.
So, roll for the next day, Captain, or somebody else, if you'd like to.
-LAURA-
Always Captain. Do it, Captain.
-TALIESIN-
Captain always.
-SAM-
Tusktooth.
-TRAVIS-
You fucker.
Six.
-MATT-
Six.
As you guys continue on in this day, one of the individuals off the side of the ship begins to call, "Oh Cap'n! Cap'n, there's something in the water!" And they all look over.
"All right, man the ballista. Something's following."
-SAM-
Ah, shit.
-TRAVIS-
Something's following?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I'll run up to the stern of the ship.
-MATT-
You glance over and you can see they're pointing off to the side. Maybe about 60 or so feet in the water, there is something large, about 10 feet below the surface that is just swimming alongside.
It's causing a slight bow in the water surface, and there is a bit of a trail behind it, left in its wake.
-TRAVIS-
Couldn't be.
Caduceus!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah?
-TRAVIS-
Come take a look, please.
-TALIESIN-
Well, that's weird.
-TRAVIS-
What do you think that is?
-TALIESIN-
Some sort of weird rise in the water.
-MATT-
Yes, no, I gathered as much.
What do you think is causing it?
-TALIESIN-
("I don't know" sound) (laughter)
-MATT-
Do you want to roll a perception check?
-TALIESIN-
Sure.
Give myself advantage because, you know, I can.
I'm taking my time.
-TRAVIS-
(chuckles) "Taking my time."
-TALIESIN-
That's terrible. 18.
-MATT-
18?
-TALIESIN-
18's terrible for me.
-MATT-
It's not hiding itself.
You can't make out all the details of it, but you can see a dull gray mass that is swimming in pace with the ship.
You can make out some of the shape.
Make a nature check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh, this'll go poorly.
14.
-MATT-
14. You have no idea what the hell this thing is.
-TALIESIN-
It's just pacing us? It doesn't seem to be--
-MATT-
At the moment, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
All right, just keep an eye on it, I guess.
-MATT-
You can see they're shifting the ballista over to that side of the ship and they're starting to get it mounted up and ready to fire.
-TRAVIS-
Captain, if I could ask, is it your intention to fire while being unprovoked? Or only if it attacks?
-MATT-
"Rightly so, we're going to go ahead and make sure it does not make any aggressive actions without retaliation.
We're just keeping an eye."
-TRAVIS-
Fair enough.
-LAURA-
How big of a-- is it?
-MATT-
From what you can tell, it's probably about 15 to 20 feet from side to side and close to 50 to 60 feet front to back.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god, what is that?
-LAURA-
Can I call out to it?
-LIAM-
Whale.
-MATT-
Sure, what do you say?
-LAURA-
Oy! Why are you following us?
-TALIESIN-
I can do it. It'll actually-- Hey, do you need anything? Are you all right? It can understand me, so I figured--
-MATT-
As you shout, make a persuasion check.
-TRAVIS-
(rapid impacts) (groans)
-TALIESIN-
13.
-MATT-
13, okay.
It begins to breach the surface.
And as you see the upper part of its body, the dull gray coloration is actually a thick scaled hide over a humped shoulder that you can see these heavy flippers that push through. In fact, there are multiple sets: three sets, six total, large flippers that start large at the back and slowly descend in size to the base.
This almost Plesiosaur-type neck and head begins to emerge from the top.
You have not seen a creature like this before.
You can roll a nature check, if you'd like.
-LAURA-
Okay! Ooh, a 19.
I've seen something like this in my storybooks.
-MATT-
This is a cetus.
-LAURA-
It's a cetus!
-MATT-
They are an extremely rare sea creature that-- it's rare to the point where it's largely used as a myth to scare sailors, to warn people of territorial beasts that live in the furthest-off parts of the ocean.
They are territorial, and this one appears to have some sort of an albino coloration to it, as its eyes are a bright pink red, and as its head emerges and looks up in your direction, you can see it glances up at you with a hint of intelligence, though you're uncertain of its intent.
-TALIESIN-
Do we have anybody who can talk? We're going to see if you need anything.
We're going to try and figure out if we can understand you, give us a second.
-LAURA-
Do I remember in my storybooks what it likes to eat or anything?
-MATT-
You're not terribly certain.
Unfortunately, with that roll, you're not able to to pick up the specific details of a creature like this' lifestyle.
You just know what it is.
It's rare enough to the point where you'd have to roll higher to learn that information.
-LIAM-
Caleb is going to pull out his raven's feather and cast Fly and fly out maybe 40 or 50 feet above the water.
-MATT-
Okay. The head traces you as you get close.
You hear this dull rumbling gurgle that sounds like a growl.
-LIAM-
I'm going to attempt to--
-MATT-
(growls)
-LIAM-
-- Polymorph myself into it.
-MATT-
Okay.
Okay, above it?
-LIAM-
No. No, no, no.
Space so that I could swan dive maybe 50 feet away from it.
I'm not trying to body slam it.
-MATT-
So you Polymorph into it.
Much like the whales in "Hitchhiker's Guide," you just plummet from the air for a second before (splashing) Not quite as horrible an impact as in "Hitchhiker's," but you hit the water and watch as the creature about face suddenly, and turns the head.
-TALIESIN-
So we can talk, hold on.
-LIAM-
I start to flirt, visually flirt.
-MATT-
Okay, its first action is defensive.
-TRAVIS-
Territorial.
-MATT-
Go ahead and make a persuasion check.
-LIAM-
Okay, I'm going to try to just roll over in the water.
-MATT-
Correct. The charisma bonus on this as a plus one.
-TRAVIS-
Do you show your belly?
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>. Like Sprigg.
I don't know what the bonus would be, but I rolled a 10.
-MATT-
Okay, okay.
A 10 will not incite aggressive action.
It is no longer chasing the boat, but it is looking towards you and keeping a distance and is now in the process of gauging what you are here to do.
Roll a d20 and add two for your perception check with it.
-LIAM-
20, dirty 20.
-MATT-
With that, you notice below the water, near it, two smaller forms, similar coloration, but no more than maybe 10 feet across, 25 foot in length.
You get the sense that this is a mother.
-LIAM-
So I'm not going to get any closer.
I'm going to stay the same distance away but I'm going to try to swim playfully around the family.
Absolutely the indication is that I'm being silly as a creature with them.
-MATT-
All right.
The mother appears untrusting, but is not taking it as an aggressive action.
Interesting point, between your physicality and the physicality of this creature: it appears more sallow than you.
-LIAM-
Sallow? Oh, okay.
-MATT-
Thin, gaunt.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's hungry.
-MATT-
And based on the proximity to the ship and the arrangement of this pod you gather their interest with the large, moving barge of a ship that you are currently riding on is because they're looking for food.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Can I kick off any bit of the mage body into the water? Did we already do that?
-MATT-
They didn't leave it on there for three days.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's right, it's been three days.
-MATT-
Like, "That'll come in handy later." Yeah, that's already been thrown in underwater.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And for that purpose the only person that knows of this creature's current intent would be Caleb.
So you would have to convey that to the party.
You guys right now are just watching as the ship is making more distance between you and the creature and Caleb.
Just hoping that this doesn't go poorly.
-LIAM-
So if I'm in this thing's form am I able to communicate, then?
-MATT-
You can certainly try.
-LIAM-
So I'm going to try to say: Hungry? Hungry? Hungry? Hungry?
-MATT-
It responds with a series of clicking and deep gurgling, rattling sounds from within its throat and you interpret it to mean, "Yes, but why do you help?"
-LIAM-
I will roll a couple flips in the water and smile as this creature's version of smiling and try to say "wait" through gurgle.
(gurgling)
-MATT-
Its head cocks to one side, the children now emerge for air.
They're going to come up.
-LAURA-
Babies!
-MATT-
And the mother takes one of the heavy flippers in the front and pushes them to the back to keep them protected.
And just head cocks to the side again once more.
She's waiting.
-LIAM-
So I'll crest to the surface and (splashing) My head comes up and I swivel around and look for the big pink cow guy that I kind of remember and know.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I will gurgle at Caduceus and try to communicate.
-TALIESIN-
I can't understand.
-LIAM-
Hungry.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know what you're-- You can understand me, but I-- Can you mime it?
-LIAM-
(gurgling) (munching)
-TALIESIN-
Oh, food?
-LIAM-
(gurgling)
-TALIESIN-
What do you eat?
-LIAM-
Back to the family.
-TRAVIS-
They hungry?
-TALIESIN-
I think.
-TRAVIS-
I suppose I could summon a greater demon for them to chew on.
-SAM-
You'd have to kill it first, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Well, no. I mean, the barlgura doesn't really swim.
I mean, yeah, they'd have to kill it first, yes.
But just drop it in the water.
-MATT-
You do recall from previous experiences in which demons you've killed and/or summoned died, their bodies quickly turned to an ashy sludge and were burned away.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but we could swim away in that time.
(laughter)
-SAM-
We did buy a bunch of fancy rations for ourselves.
We've probably eaten half of them, but we could just dump the rest.
-LAURA-
We can Create Food and Water for ourselves and give them the tasty stuff we bought.
-SAM-
We bought mostly fish, I think.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
I'm going to grab some of my fish.
-TALIESIN-
Would you know what you want to eat anyway?
-SAM-
Yeah, let's toss some fish.
Ooh! Why don't just paint--
-LAURA-
(gasps) The pastries!
-SAM-
Oh, I was going to say paint a giant fish.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know if that'll survive the water.
-LAURA-
Huh?
-TALIESIN-
I think if they got wet, they're no longer pastries.
-LAURA-
Well, I'm going to try to throw it so they'll catch it.
-TALIESIN-
They're not going to--
-LAURA-
Like ducks at the lake.
-SAM-
They don't eat bread.
-TALIESIN-
Ducks actually shouldn't eat bread, that's bad for-- oh.
-LIAM-
The Caleb cetus is, like, 1950s synchronized swimmer just swimming back and forth between the ship and this family.
Just to keep things light and friendly.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Not good for ducks.
-SAM-
There's nothing that calms a nervous mother like an erratic man.
-LIAM-
Not right on top of it.
I'm 70 or 80 feet away from it.
-TRAVIS-
I want to play with your kids.
-MATT-
You throw some of these pastries into the water and they impact the icy surface.
You watch as the two children slowly begin to pull away from the mother who allows them to and they snap them from underneath.
-LAURA-
And some fish.
Some of my fish that I bought.
-TALIESIN-
Try a couple fish first.
Don't know if they eat the-- okay.
-MATT-
They go right for the fish, and the mother seems to react to the introduction of fish to this arrangement, begins to shift over in the direction.
The boat has slowed down at this point, as the captain's seeing what you're doing.
-LAURA-
They like fish!
-SAM-
Let's dump all of our food.
-MATT-
It will take pretty much all of your rations to try and feed this family--
-SAM-
Do it.
-MATT-
-- because they are big creatures.
But you will be out of food for the rest of this journey.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, we'll lure them in and then we'll eat them.
-LIAM-
I have my boba within my form right now.
-ASHLEY-
Can we summon any fishies or anything?
-LAURA-
I don't have Create Food today.
-TALIESIN-
No, we would have to eat today, but I could have it tomorrow.
It does burn a-- one of us will burn a spell slot.
That's okay.
-LAURA-
Is there anything else they want? I really like them.
-TALIESIN-
I think most of our food is--
-MATT-
The crew's not going to give up their food.
-LAURA-
I'm going to hold out a fish.
And I want it to take it from my hand so I can pet it.
-MATT-
Okay.
Actually, the children would be too small.
But make a persuasion check for the mother.
Actually no, make this animal handling, this is what this'll be.
-TALIESIN-
Even better.
-TRAVIS-
Remember the dinosaur movie, "Baby" from the 80s?
-LAURA-
Ooh! 21!
-MATT-
As the children are now below making these strange (trilling) sounds the mother swims up alongside the slow ship.
The head rises up and comes eye line with you.
And the head is about seven to 10 feet from edge to edge.
The eyes are bulbous at the top just based on the proximity and the perspective that you have as a much smaller creature.
And as it comes up, suddenly these two slits in the front of the nose.
(inhales sharply) Sniff towards the fish.
And as it does, you feel your hair.
(exhales sharply) Towards it.
You hold the fish out.
The mouth opens and you can see rows and rows and rows of jagged, sharp teeth.
-LAURA-
Why aren't you getting enough food right now?
-MATT-
Lets you pet the nose a bit.
Do you give the fish?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You throw the fish and it touches the tongue.
As soon as it does the jaw slams shut in a way that causes the air to (whooshes) blow your hair the other direction for a second.
And you're like, okay, glad you didn't pet that creature's tongue.
It accepts it.
It seems disappointed with the volume of what it was fed, but it accepted it.
-LAURA-
Oh man.
-MATT-
What do you do?
-TALIESIN-
Well, it's what we got.
-SAM-
Bye.
-TALIESIN-
We appreciate you letting us pass through there.
-MATT-
So you're going to keep your food and keep going.
-SAM-
No, we should dump.
I want to dump all of our rations.
-LAURA-
We'll do create food and water for ourselves.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
So giving up all the purchased rations right?
-MATT-
To feed these, it will take all of your rations.
You'll be left with only the ability to feed yourselves.
You will not eat for the remainder of the day and you will have to subsist on spells for the next length of the journey.
You're okay with that?
-LIAM-
And boba, I got boba.
-MATT-
You got boba, okay.
-MARISHA-
It's fine.
-MATT-
All right.
The crew stands at first aghast, though a few of them seem to be like, "This is adorable, but stupid non-sailors." Watch you shovel all of your fine purchased food from Palebank Village into the mouth of this mother and into the ocean around for the children to eat until you are out of your reserves, but seemingly sated and appreciative the creatures eventually peel off and then move to the front of the ship.
And the Captain, after a while, is like, "Are they wanting us to follow them?"
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I think so.
-MATT-
"I suppose, I guess so." So in following the creatures, it leads them through some of the tougher ice fields and cuts a day off the journey.
-MARISHA-
Cool.
-SAM-
Nice.
-MATT-
Which brings it to one more day.
Roll for the final roll.
-SAM-
♪ One more day! ♪
-MATT-
As you wake up the following morning, they have left, but you've made some time back on the trip.
-LAURA-
They'll come back, they like us a lot.
-TALIESIN-
Do you want Create Food and Water, or should I take Create Food and Water?
-TRAVIS-
Eight.
-MATT-
Eight? You hit the ice channel that they were trying to help you avoid.
It does slow you for one further day, but only one more day.
So make one more roll.
-SAM-
♪ One more day ♪
-LAURA-
(laughing) One more.
-LIAM-
♪ Another roll another ♪
-SAM-
♪ Destiny. ♪ Eight.
-MARISHA-
What is it?
-TRAVIS-
It's a 10.
-MATT-
A 10?
-SAM-
That's good.
-TRAVIS-
The extremes are not good.
-MATT-
A strong, chilled wind and ocean flow pushes in your favor.
Two days of the journey are taken away from it.
So with smooth sailing, you actually, in half a day's travel--
-SAM-
♪ Half a day ♪
-MATT-
-- watch as the ice fog begins to pull away.
And one of the members of the crew at the front goes, "Captain! Land ho!" The bell goes off. (bell ringing) You all begin to gather at the front of the ship.
You can see the icy coastline in the dark, clouded midday fog as it peels away, your vision being able to see not just the edge of the water in front of you, that has dragged you along this journey for the better part of two weeks, but you can see dozens of orange, glowing dots that signify the torchlight in the windows of the ramshackle fort that greets you, known as Balenpost.
10-foot walls of frozen logs form around the perimeter, while a small gate marking the seaside entrance sits there, where a small set of docks await the arrival of your massive ship.
Nearing the end of the waters, you feel the entire boat lurch.
(impacting) as it makes an impact with the ice wall cliff and begins to nestle itself against the dockside.
The crew begins to gather their supplies as anchors are dropped.
And as you look over the edge, you can see the somewhat threadbare crew that mans this side begins to swell.
As you glance up and Vess DeRogna stands there on the deck and she's doing this with their fingers.
And as you glance directly above her, you can see a conjured illusion of the green tri-diamonds that marks the symbol of the Cerberus Assembly.
And that's where we're going to go ahead and end today's episode.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-MATT-
We'll pick up next week, with the arrival at Balenpost and your true arrival at Eiselcross.
-TRAVIS-
We made it, no problem.
-TALIESIN-
We got cool toys, too.
We haven't even done object identifying anything fancy.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I forgot about that.
-MATT-
That's true.
-LIAM-
Candy corn on a string.
-MATT-
(chuckling)
-MARISHA-
Woo!
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
Hey Travis, you're not dead.
-LIAM-
Wait, I would've done that.
I absolutely would've done that.
What's the candy corn?
-MATT-
The candy corn meaning the--?
-LIAM-
The crystal, the orange crystal.
-TALIESIN-
The crystal and the dagger.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that the mage had?
-MATT-
Right.
-LIAM-
Hundred percent would have done that.
-MATT-
So the orange crystal is a rough divining stone.
It is affixed to a specific object, but it has to be of the essence of the creator.
Meaning you can't use it to find <i>any</i>thing.
It's generally used to discover things that once belonged to the owner.
It's not a specific spell that is, like, crafted.
This is older and more primal, if that makes any sense.
And then enchantment is oddly vague, but it makes sense given the more primal and ancient force that perhaps gifted this to the entity that clutched it, where you met on the deck of the ship.
-LIAM-
And I deduce that it was attuned to in an effort to find the Cloven Crystal.
-MATT-
Correct, and was attuned to the crystal.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
Cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
I will say, because of your intelligence, you do discern-- You know what, actually, roll an investigation check for me.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-LIAM-
Investigation, you say? 27.
-MATT-
You deduce, based on the arrival, the crystal, and how easily you've traveled on land, in parts of land, without this sort of influence, this is attuned specifically to the Cloven Crystal and only seems to have an effect when its proximity is near large bodies of water.
And you deduce that, seemingly, their focus is more on the crystal and the ability to follow the crystal, than to follow Fjord.
-SAM-
Pretty cool.
-MATT-
Did you say you wanted to look up what the dagger was as well?
-LIAM-
Well, yeah.
I would have looked at those, even though you said that the runes or the filigree or whatever had disappeared, I would still go though the effort.
-MATT-
The rapier is just a rapier.
Whatever enchantment there was not within the actual object, but instead was a boon granted from an outside force that transformed the rapier while in the hands of its wielder.
Not unlike the falchion that was once wielded by Fjord.
The dagger, however, retains its enchantment, and is a nasty, wicked-looking thing.
You identify that.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That is referred to as--
-ASHLEY-
(whispered) Dagger, dagger, dagger.
-MATT-
There you go.
Where did I put the sheet? Here.
There is is.
Wait, no, that's not it.
Damn it, I'm sorry.
Just a moment.
-LIAM-
I cast Banish on it and--
-LAURA-
I have another question.
-TALIESIN-
If I recall, Whisper was found on a ship. Anyway.
-MATT-
I can't find the object itself right now, but I can look it up right now in D&amp;D Beyond on my homebrew collection.
-TALIESIN-
I believe Whisper was once found on a sunken ship or someone sank a ship getting it.
-MATT-
It's called the Corecut Dagger
-LIAM-
Corecut.
And it is within your D&amp;D Beyond, if you want to look up the specifics of it.
It is a dark metal blade that is wicked and hooked curve that is cold to the touch.
Has a plus one bonus to attack and damage rolls.
And when you hit with an attack made with the weapon while attuned, you can expend a hit die to deal an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.
How do you spell corecut?
-TRAVIS-
C-O-R-E?
-MATT-
Corecut, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, found it.
-LAURA-
That's cool.
-TRAVIS-
3d6 is no joke.
-MATT-
But you have to spend a hit dice to do that ability each time.
-LIAM-
Oh, interesting.
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
(whistles) Mean.
-MATT-
So those items are at your disposal and we'll pick up as you arrive here at Balenpost.
-SAM-
Exciting.
-MATT-
Next week.
Thank you all so much for joining us--
-SAM-
Boomerang!
-MATT-
Have a wonderful week.
We love you very much.
And is it Thursday yet? Good night! (cheering)

-LAURA-
Oh, I do.
You guys.
-MATT-
Oh, here we go.
-TRAVIS-
Grabs box.
-LAURA-
♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪ Zis is beautiful. The Shattered Teeth dice set.
(gasping)
I know.
It's another collab with Everything Dice.
♪ (excited humming) ♪
-MATT-
That is awesome.
-LAURA-
This packaging is by Rebecca Shieh. It's beautiful.
It's available now in the US, the UK, and the EU.
Do you want me to show you something that you probably won't be able to see up close right now?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Yes, please.
-LAURA-
It comes with a shining... thing.
-MARISHA-
What did you do--
-TRAVIS-
Oh, like a polishing cloth?
-LAURA-
A polishing cloth.
-MARISHA-
You held it up--
-TRAVIS-
You didn't even open it--
-MATT-
The one thing you don't want people to see, you're not able to see it now! (laughter)
-LAURA-
I wanted to get to the dice!
-MATT-
I get it, I get it.
-LAURA-
The d20.
(gasping)
They're so cool.
The d20 has the volcano.
-MATT-
Oh, what!?
-ALL-
Whoa.
-LAURA-
Then all the other dice have the other islands, you guys.
-LIAM-
Oh, that's--
-MARISHA-
No way!
-LAURA-
It's so fucking cool!
-MATT-
That's really cool.
-MARISHA-
That's awesome.
-LAURA-
They're beautiful.
They're beautiful.
Check them out. Go check them out.
-ASHLEY-
I thought there was going to be teeth in them.
-LAURA-
No.
-ASHLEY-
I was real excited.
-LAURA-
Yeah, you do like teeth.
-MATT-
That's the next set, Ashley.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, please.
-MATT-
We're going to put all your baby teeth in dice.
-ASHLEY-
Just give me a teeth dice set!
-LAURA-
Aren't they so cool?
-TALIESIN-
Collect them all.
-MATT-
That's the like tiny little--
-ASHLEY-
Wow, that is so cool!
-LAURA-
Look at it, do you see the volcano? Okay, okay.
-TALIESIN-
The volcano, let me see the volcano.
-ASHLEY-
It's so detailed.
-ROBBIE-
Can I see it?
-TRAVIS-
Hand them back, collect yourself.
-LAURA-
Yes, okay, sorry, sorry. Give them back to me.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, that's so fucking cool.
-MATT-
That's really, really cool.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god, the clouds.
-MATT-
Technically, if you buy how many sets of this, you could build the Shattered Teeth. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, right.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
How many islands are in the Shattered Teeth, Matt?
-MATT-
43, I think? I'll have to look at my notes.
-LAURA-
Seven, precisely seven.
-MATT-
Sure.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
57.
-LAURA-
Ooh, lucky 13.
Okay, I'm done.
-MATT-
All righty, I believe that concludes our announcements.

And welcome back.
(snickering)
-ASHLEY-
Oh man.
-MATT-
Last we left off--
-TRAVIS-
We're going to die.
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(heavy sigh) Don't be mean to me.
-ASHLEY-
Liam coming in.
-ROBBIE-
He's trying to kill us.
-MATT-
Last we left off: Bells Hells, upon hearing that Ludinus Da'leth was indeed not on Ruidus, but was dealing with another important factor in Exandria-- but was dealing with another important factor in Exandria--
-ASHLEY-
Shit!
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Had been-- (chuckles)
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-MATT-
Had been noted to be towards Eiselcross, specifically in the long buried and frozen ruins of Aeor, to the far north of Wildemount.
After gathering yourselves, after gathering Dorian Storm, was returned to the troop--
-LAURA-
♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪
-MATT-
-- gathering some materials in Zadash after an interrogation, after making some orders and setting yourselves up for a dangerous and chilly journey, and a number of failed teleports, you managed to finally arrive-- (laughter)
-- on the outskirts of the ruins of Aeor.
Your guide, revealed to be Essek Thelyss, a fugitive from the Kryn Dynasty, and had previously had experience wandering through these ruins a number of times, guiding you through, you began to traverse the subterranean ice-covered layers, the strange and oddly magical, and magic altering auras that occasionally flow through this space, you found the shattered, broken, and some cases still locked in time, memory of this ancient mage city.
As you began to delve towards the central portion of the Genesis Ward, in which, looking for information on this locale that came up in the interrogation, the Occultus Thalamus, seemed to be tied to what Ludinus and the Vanguard had been doing down here, and where he likely will be.
You investigated a Vanguard tent that had been built in one of these city streets that still remained.
Investigating, you found the people within had all been slaughtered, Vanguard members, bloodily, and looking into its history and the scene of the crime, it looked like one of their own had done the deed before killing themselves, after carving an odd symbol into their chest with a blade.
During this investigation, some heavy thuds were heard nearby, and as you all gathered yourselves, and darted off into the nearby shadows, some strange creature began to lumber around, this massive, elongated, gray and black fleshed entity, these sunken jowls, that seemingly faceless, and this odd, big mouth of teeth in the center of its torso, began to, seemingly stirred by the sounds and conversation you were making, look about the space.
One of you, unfortunately, had a rough time hiding, and caught its attention, where a number of these-- (laughter)
-- translucent, armored, chitinous, insectoid creatures began to emerge from its mouth and crawl across the ground in your direction.
-MARISHA-
Just smacks into a glass door.
Just "Ugh, sorry, guys."
-MATT-
It comes for us all, eventually.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
The glass door?
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And to that point, please roll initiative.
(groaning and exclaiming)
-TRAVIS-
No, don't be so casual about it!
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MARISHA-
You guys, this combat is brought to you by WizKids minis! The Vox Machina box set is available for pre-order!
-TRAVIS-
(imitates Marisha)
-MARISHA-
Find these and many more Critical Role miniatures at WizKids.io/crminis, and your local game store! Let's fucking do this.
-TALIESIN-
I rolled really well.
-LIAM-
Real low.
-TALIESIN-
I rolled really high.
-MATT-
All righty.
-MARISHA-
Ew, icky.
-MATT-
So to remind everyone where you scattered off to.
We have, over here we have Dorian, Chetney, and Orym over by this dome and amongst the outskirts of these ruins.
Essek darted off to this side of the map over here.
We have Fearne, Ashton, and Laudna right over here, with Imogen on that corner.
Laudna seems to be the one to gain the attention, so all these creatures are now scattering outside of this massive entity, and crawling in her direction with expediency.
So, going to the initiative order, we have the top 25 to 20.
-TALIESIN-
21.
-TRAVIS-
Orym, this is where you normally--
-LAURA-
Did you roll as bad as me?
-LIAM-
Not this time.
-LAURA-
You rolled shit, didn't you?
-TRAVIS-
Ashton's up top.
-LIAM-
I rolled shit.
-MATT-
All right, 20 to--
-LAURA-
What did Ashton roll?
-TALIESIN-
21.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
20 to 15.
-ASHLEY-
19.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh, wow.
-TALIESIN-
We're fucking dead.
-MARISHA-
We are so dead.
-ASHLEY-
Hey!
-TALIESIN-
Well, this is going to go well.
-MATT-
15 to 10.
-ASHLEY-
You're probably right!
-LIAM-
14.
-MARISHA-
Ooh.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!
-LAURA-
Wow, we all rolled really bad!
-ROBBIE-
Big scares.
-LAURA-
Fuck, fuck! Fuck.
-MATT-
All righty.
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no, now we got to demonetized, Laura, good job.
-MATT-
10 to five.
-ROBBIE-
10 to five? Oh, that would be me.
-LAURA-
Six.
-ROBBIE-
<i>Ocho.</i>
-TRAVIS-
<i>Ocho</i>, okay.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
So Dorian--
-LAURA-
So wait--
-TRAVIS-
I wrote "Robbie" in the initiative order, no!
-ROBBIE-
That's okay, look me in the eyes and do it.
-LAURA-
Me, I'm after Orym?
-TALIESIN-
Ashton, Orym, Dorian.
-MATT-
Hold on, what'd you roll?
-LAURA-
No, I rolled six!
-ROBBIE-
I rolled eight.
-TRAVIS-
Imogen.
-LAURA-
Oh--
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-MATT-
All right, so Imogen six.
Five to one.
-MARISHA-
Four.
-TRAVIS-
Four.
-ASHLEY-
Rollies?
-TRAVIS-
Dex?
-MATT-
Who has the highest dex?
-MARISHA-
Oh, dex or Rollies, I got to do Rollies.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, what's it say?
-MARISHA-
It's Rollies!
-TRAVIS-
Eat shit and die.
-ROBBIE-
(gasps)
-TRAVIS-
15.
-MARISHA-
I rolled a two again.
-TRAVIS-
(tongue waggling) (exclaiming)
-ROBBIE-
Did you roll a two, too?
-MARISHA-
I rolled two twos.
-ROBBIE-
Two twos!
-ROBBIE-
Three twos!
-LAURA-
Get them all out.
-MATT-
Two Tuesday.
All right, there we go.
(chuckles)
-ROBBIE-
Chet.
-MARISHA-
Wow.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
It's just matching up with your stealth.
-TRAVIS-
Ashton, Fearne, Orym, Dorian, Imogen, Chetney, Laudna.
-ROBBIE-
How many translucent guys are there?
-LAURA-
What did Essek roll?
-MATT-
Hm? Oh, you want to know?
-TRAVIS-
Shall I?
-TALIESIN-
That'd be nice.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, true.
-LIAM-
Go, hot boi.
-MATT-
He rolled-- ASHLEY Hot boi!
Hold on, his sheet here.
-LAURA-
Hot boi, hot boi!
-MATT-
Sheet is--
-LIAM-
Teleported out of here.
-TRAVIS-
If he's still here.
-MATT-
No, he's over there.
I, actually, his sheet, I forgot to pull it out, so let me pull that here.
In all my preparation here, that was the one thing that I forgot to bring out of my binder.
-TALIESIN-
It's interesting, even his character sheet--
-TRAVIS-
♪ Hot boi ♪
-TALIESIN-
-- floats about an inch above the table.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Doing things ♪ ♪ only hot bois can ♪
-MATT-
It's true.
There it is.
-TALIESIN-
It's a hovercraft.
-MATT-
I was like, "Where is his dex? Oh, his sheet's not here." All right, so that puts him at a--
-LIAM-
Whip it out.
-MATT-
-- 13.
-LAURA-
13, that puts him--
-LIAM-
Right behind Orym.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Oh, just a Essek sandwich between Orym and Dorian.
Okay.
-LIAM-
Mm.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, I want to get in on this!
-LIAM-
Echoes through the multiverse.
-TRAVIS-
The sounds of thousands of pens hitting--
-MATT-
He is taken.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Ow, my head!
-MATT-
Ashton.
You're up first.
-TALIESIN-
All right!
-MATT-
As this entity is dragging this massive piece of elongated metal and ruined stone behind it in the shape of a massive hammer, and it's ready to just swing it or lob it in that direction, what do you do?
-TALIESIN-
Well, first of all--
-LAURA-
Hammer versus hammer!
-TALIESIN-
I'm not saying it, not fucking saying it, but I'm going to rage, first of all.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to fucking--
-LIAM-
Hammer time.
-TALIESIN-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
What are you not going to say?
-LAURA-
Oh, it's hammer time?
-TALIESIN-
It's hammer time.
I'm not saying it.
-MATT-
You just did.
-TALIESIN-
We're not going there. Fuck!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to get you to say it.
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit.
-LIAM-
♪ Ashton hits me so hard. ♪
-TALIESIN-
So, I start getting this strange little--
-LAURA-
♪ Oh my lord. ♪
-TALIESIN-
-- trails of red and blue coming out my head and streaking across the hammer, and I am going to move-- What's the first thing I can get to? Is there a scorpion in front of that tent?
-MATT-
There are two of these entities right there, and there's one back here, up here, and then the other ones, you can--
-TALIESIN-
All right, how far will 40 feet towards that will 40 feet get me?
-MATT-
40 feet? Five, 10, you're getting up onto this terrain right here.
Five, 10, you can leap here, 15, 20, 25, 30.
35 can get you onto the top of the tent and hope that it holds you.
-TRAVIS-
Hope it'll hold you.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, he's too tall up for me to go into the tent and whack him from below, or can I?
-MATT-
Actually, the one up front here, you can get to, if you want.
-TALIESIN-
That's 35?
-MATT-
That would be, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.
-TALIESIN-
Perfect.
-MARISHA-
Help!
-TALIESIN-
So, I'm going to take a couple swings at these motherfuckers.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
These motherfuckers!
-TALIESIN-
Let's see.
-LIAM-
♪ Fine hammer ♪
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, let's take a look.
Okay, I'm sorry, just seeing what I got. Perfect.
Here we go, first attack.
Why am I doing that? That's wrong. I don't have advantage.
There we go. 19 plus-- I don't crit on a 19 yet, do I? No.
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, that's later.
-MATT-
Unless you have an item that lets you do that.
-LIAM-
What if I felt like critting on a 19?
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to remember.
-MATT-
Pretty much just the champion.
-TALIESIN-
I'm still thrown by other games we've played recently.
-MATT-
That's true.
-TALIESIN-
That's, yeah, 30 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits.
-TALIESIN-
All right, let's--
-LIAM-
Ray!
-TALIESIN-
-- find all my dice, so that's--
-LIAM-
Stupid.
-LAURA-
So dumb.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to reroll that one. I don't like it.
Six, seven, eight, nine.
Is that right? Yeah, god, I'm a beast.
That's 21 points of damage.
-MATT-
21 points of damage.
-ASHLEY-
Tight.
-MATT-
Oof, all right. You smash it with the hammer.
Legs go out, and you pull the hammer up.
The element that you smashed, parts of its armor crack, and a liquid sprays you.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
You take six points of acid damage.
-TALIESIN-
Cool, we're doing that, are we? All right.
-ASHLEY-
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
-MATT-
As you pull up your hammer, it sticks to your hammer.
-ROBBIE-
(gasps)
-TRAVIS-
Nasty.
-MATT-
It is currently restrained, but restrained to you.
(oohing)
-ROBBIE-
Oh, ew!
-MATT-
Its body weirdly flexes with the impact, and then sticks to your weapon, and as you lift your hammer up, you can see it trying to skitter down the hammer towards you.
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-MATT-
What else you got?
-TALIESIN-
That's fucking gross.
-LIAM-
Sticky Xenomorph.
-TALIESIN-
I don't have anything else to do other than hit it the fuck again and hope I pop the thing like a goddamn grape.
-MATT-
All right, so you spin the hammer to get it back on the bottom side and try--
-TALIESIN-
I'm literally grabbing it and tossing it with the hammer down, and trying to get that curve that you do.
-MATT-
See if you can hit the bell, ping! Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, get that little squish that makes the scorpion pop.
Y'all know what I'm talking about.
Maybe you don't. 27.
-MATT-
27 hits. I used the restrained, I'll use grappled.
-TALIESIN-
You have to turn your heel on a scorpion, or else it won't die.
-LAURA-
You can do it, Ashton! Take them all out!
-LIAM-
Kill it.
-ROBBIE-
Did you turn into an old prospector? (old timey dude) You got to turn your heel on a scorpion, or it won't die.
-TALIESIN-
-- on that thing, or it's just going to pop back up and be mad at you.
-ASHLEY-
He did teach me this. He taught me that.
-TALIESIN-
23.
-MATT-
23 points of damage.
I don't even need to put the grappled condition down, because you destroy it.
-TALIESIN-
Yah!
-MATT-
You do take another one point of acid damage.
-ASHLEY-
Nice, nice!
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
But it immediately splatters in space.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Great.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to let everybody know.
They're sticky and filled with acid! God fucking damn it! I'm going to try and dive behind the tent.
-MATT-
How much more movement do you have?
-LIAM-
He's at 35.
-TALIESIN-
Five more feet.
-MATT-
Five more feet? Then yeah, you (grunts) behind the side.
All right, cool.
That finishes your go.
Now it's their turn.
-LAURA-
Oh great, cool.
-ROBBIE-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
♪ They rolled better than we did ♪
-ROBBIE-
They're all coming out of--
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit.
-LIAM-
Now they're all going to be on top.
-MATT-
This one here is going to leap off--
-MARISHA-
Here we go, baby!
-TALIESIN-
He has to make a constitution.
That one has to make a constitution saving throw.
-MATT-
Oh, okay. For?
-TALIESIN-
"When a creature of your choice begins its turn within 15 feet of you, they must succeed on a con saving throw, or speed is halved and they can't use reactions till their next turn."
-MATT-
Okay, it failed, so its speed is halved.
It leaps. That's five, 10.
Its speed is 40, so it can go 20 feet, which can still get there with a leap.
-TALIESIN-
But it has no reaction.
-MATT-
But it has no reaction, correct.
-TALIESIN-
So you can walk away from it if you need to.
-MATT-
This one here is going to skitter down and attack you this way.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-MATT-
Of course, it falls into the tent as I drop it.
There we go. This one skitters down after it sees you there.
This one here is going to, one, two, three--
-ASHLEY-
(whistles)
-MATT-
-- 30, 35.
This one's going to rush over here to you.
This one here is going to go Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, guys.
-MATT-
Five, 10, 15.
-ASHLEY-
Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes!
-LIAM-
Sorry, Taliesin, we're going to have to AoE you.
-MATT-
This one is going to dart, is going to dash and come back around to swarm you on this side, and you are entirely surrounded from all of them.
So with that--
-LIAM-
Jeez.
-MATT-
-- that's going to be three attacks on you, Laudna, from them.
-MARISHA-
Let's go, baby.
Come on, come on!
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
That's going to be--
-LIAM-
You're a little off-voice.
-MATT-
-- an 11.
-MARISHA-
Miss.
-MATT-
Misses. The next one--
-ASHLEY-
The shock.
-ROBBIE-
A miss.
-MATT-
10.
-MARISHA-
Miss.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
Yes!
-TRAVIS-
Tell us! Tell us the news!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Natural one.
-TRAVIS-
Tell us the news!
-MATT-
It was descending.
It was three, two, one.
-ASHLEY-
Cool table tonight!
-MATT-
Goddamn it.
-MARISHA-
Wow!
-ROBBIE-
Does he slip and break his claw or something?
-MATT-
Yeah, one of them goes striking for you.
You dodge out of the way, another one comes and bites for you, and instinctively, you put your hand in front of you, and the dark shadow parries it off to the side.
The third one that leaps towards you, you duck, and it goes slamming into the rock next to where you are.
As it pulls back, one of its mandibles is cracked and it's like (painful chitters) and pulls away.
It's awful, because as they move, you can see the muscles underneath--
-LIAM-
Hate it.
-MATT-
-- the chitinous armor.
-LAURA-
It's see-through?
-MATT-
Yeah, the armor is translucent.
(general moans of disgust)
-LAURA-
I don't like it.
-ASHLEY-
I hate it.
-MATT-
The four against you, two of which get advantage, because they have you pincered.
-MARISHA-
Wait, is this more coming?
-TALIESIN-
Those are against Ashton.
-LAURA-
Ew! Ew!
-MARISHA-
Oh, they're for Ashton.
-MATT-
So the two that aren't, that's going to be a 16 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
-MATT-
You manage to pull out of the way.
Next one, that's going to be 25 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right, so for that, you take--
-ASHLEY-
I hate bugs with a bunch of legs.
-MATT-
All right, that's going to be five points of piercing damage.
-ASHLEY-
Centipedes, millipedes.
-MATT-
Reduced to two.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
And five points of acid damage.
-TALIESIN-
So that's seven points.
-MATT-
Correct.
That was the two that attacked you without advantage.
Now the two with advantage.
Okay, one of them is going to be a 23 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-ASHLEY-
Silverfish? Ugh.
-MATT-
That, you take eight points of piercing damage reduced to four, and six points of acid damage.
-TALIESIN-
10 points.
-MATT-
The second one-- Same roll. That hits as well.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
That's going to be nine points of piercing damage, reduced to four, and two points of acid damage.
-TALIESIN-
Sick.
-ASHLEY-
Have you seen camel spiders?
-MATT-
So that finishes their round.
That brings us to Fearne, with Orym on deck.
-TALIESIN-
That's right, yeah.
-LIAM-
Oh boy.
-TALIESIN-
I didn't fuck that up.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do something called Flaming Sphere, and I'm going to cast it on the big boy back there.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Get that big boy!
-ROBBIE-
You're going to pick a fight with--
-ASHLEY-
Big boy!
-MATT-
What's the range you can do on that?
-TALIESIN-
I have some fire resistance, by the way.
-ASHLEY-
60 feet.
-TALIESIN-
Just letting you know.
-ASHLEY-
You do?
-TALIESIN-
If you want to hit those, I do have a Ring of Fire Resistance, so I can lower the damage.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I had something else I was going to do, but I feel like it's going to mess everybody up.
-LAURA-
That's the one! That's the one, Liam!
-TALIESIN-
What are we going to do?
-MATT-
60 feet.
To put it next to it, you'd have to move five feet this way.
-MARISHA-
Uh-oh.
-LAURA-
That's exactly what I was talking about.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'll move up-- That's disgusting, and I've seen those.
Yeah, I'll pop out a little bit. Yes.
-MATT-
All right. Flaming Sphere.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so--
-MATT-
So the rest of you watch as in the middle of the shadow, suddenly, a bright light flickers in and swirls into this burning ball of flame that's about five feet wide from side to side that's now smoldering and slowly rolling on the ground in front of the creature.
As it's dragging its hammer and lifting it up, it sees it and (grotesque screeches) pulls back slightly--
-ASHLEY-
Is there a way to--
-MATT-
-- as it sees this flash of light.
-LIAM-
That's its stomach.
-TRAVIS-
Use your words!
-LIAM-
That's its stomach making that sound.
-MATT-
Yep, not the face. It doesn't have a mouth up here.
-TRAVIS-
What do you mean it doesn't have a mouth?
-ASHLEY-
So the creature takes 2d6 fire damage on fail-- Okay, it's dexterity of 19.
-LAURA-
So it backed away from the fire before it even hit him?
-MATT-
It didn't back away, it's just reacting to its arrival.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, and then--
-LAURA-
Maybe it's fire.
Maybe it doesn't like fire.
-MATT-
As a bonus action--
-ASHLEY-
I have a question, and I'm hesitating to bring this up to you.
-MATT-
-- you could slam him with it.
-ASHLEY-
3rd level or higher, magic gets a little weird.
-MATT-
Yeah. What level are you casting this at?
-ASHLEY-
That's what I was trying to figure out.
-ROBBIE-
Oh my god, I forgot.
-TRAVIS-
Just say it and then do it.
-LAURA-
Just do it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so then let's--
-LAURA-
Just do it!
-TALIESIN-
Be Fearne.
-ROBBIE-
Just do it!
-ASHLEY-
I wasn't going to say it.
-LAURA-
Chaos!
-ASHLEY-
Then I was like, maybe he won't remember.
All right, I'm going to do it at 4th-level.
-LAURA-
Yes!
-MATT-
4th-level? Go for it.
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
Punk.
-MATT-
Have to get this here.
-ROBBIE-
Do it! What's that?
-MATT-
This is the Aeor wild magic table, that might come into play.
-ASHLEY-
Did I just remind you of it?
-MATT-
No, no, no. No.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Pulling something from a tome.
-MATT-
We had everything shifted for other games.
-ASHLEY-
I know, I know.
-MATT-
It didn't all get put back in place.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
All right, so, 4th level, you said?
-ASHLEY-
4th level.
-MATT-
4th level, okay.
So as you summon it into place, I need you to roll a d20 for me.
-LAURA-
A d20, and then if you roll what, a one or a 20?
-MATT-
A 17 or higher.
-LAURA-
Oh fuck.
-ASHLEY-
17 or higher means you're fine?
-LAURA-
Then fuckery reactions.
-MATT-
No.
-ASHLEY-
That means you're fucked?
-MATT-
17 or higher means you have to roll a d100.
-LAURA-
So roll low.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, which one rolls bad? I'm going to go with this one.
14.
-MATT-
14. You're fine.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Damn it!
-TALIESIN-
Free money.
-ASHLEY-
So it's 4d6.
-MATT-
You're using your bonus action to slam it with the sphere? When you cast it, it stays there.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
If a creature ends its turn next to it, it takes damage, but you can use your bonus action to slam the sphere into it.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, I will do that. So I'll slam--
-MATT-
Okay, so it makes a dexterity save.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 16.
-ASHLEY-
Does not succeed, so--
-MATT-
Does not succeed.
Go ahead and roll damage on that sphere.
That's 4d6 points of fire damage.
-LAURA-
Sweet.
-ROBBIE-
Oof!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
-TALIESIN-
Why am I having a heart attack?
-LAURA-
Is Mister out? Do you get any bonus from Mister being out?
-ASHLEY-
No, I should've put him out.
-ROBBIE-
We've won.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
11 points of fire damage.
-MATT-
11 points of fire damage. Hey, it all helps.
All righty. Do you want to stay put or do you want to move?
-ASHLEY-
The rest of my move, I am going to tuck myself back into that little spot.
-MATT-
Back over here?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You got it. All right, that finishes your go.
Orym, you are up, with Dorian kind of on deck.
-LIAM-
Okay, with the Boots of Striding and Springing, I'm going to leap over Chet, five, 10.
-MATT-
Technically, Essek's on deck after you.
-LIAM-
Oh, well, let's do it.
-MATT-
After you.
-LIAM-
After me?
-LAURA-
No, yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, you have a much higher dexterity.
You rolled the same initiative.
-LIAM-
15, 20, 25.
Am I within 15 feet? Do I go by him or by his stand?
-MATT-
By his stand.
-LIAM-
Okay, so I am.
-MATT-
So yeah, he's 15 feet from you.
-LIAM-
Okay, so--
-ASHLEY-
Rock him like a hurricane.
-LIAM-
I run up behind, and Seedling is out, and I will slash at the air and send attacks through.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-LIAM-
Not get any closer, so-- Doot.
-TRAVIS-
Why? You think he's got some extended melee or something?
-LIAM-
I think he's got some extended melee or something.
Okay, that's an 18.
That's 29 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits.
-LIAM-
Let's make it a goading attack.
-TRAVIS-
Bring out the goats!
-LIAM-
So wisdom save.
Nine plus--
-LAURA-
♪ Trouble, trouble, trouble ♪
-LIAM-
So that's 17 damage, and--
-TRAVIS-
(Taylor Swift goat scream)
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
(Taylor Swift goat scream)
-MATT-
17 points of damage.
You got it.
-LIAM-
Then he has to make a wis save.
-LAURA-
He just needs to make a whizz.
-MATT-
That's going to be a nine.
-LIAM-
Fails, so disadvantage against anyone except for me.
Two more attacks.
-TRAVIS-
(gasps)
-MATT-
Yeah, you've effectively goaded him.
-LIAM-
That's a one, so I will reroll it.
That's also a one! That's a one. It's a real--
-ASHLEY-
Does he reroll it again?
-MATT-
No, I believe you keep the second one.
-LIAM-
I think you keep the second one.
-LIAM-
That's my first one of the game.
-LAURA-
Whoa!
-MATT-
I'll double check here, as it's been a minute since we've had this scenario.
-ASHLEY-
Must be nice.
-TRAVIS-
The first one <i>of the campaign</i>?
-LIAM-
Of the campaign.
-LAURA-
Because he always rerolls ones.
-TALIESIN-
I believe you have to--
-LIAM-
Halflings reroll ones.
-MATT-
I believe it is, too, but I'm just going to make sure.
-TALIESIN-
Worth making sure.
-MATT-
So I don't mess you up or get yelled at.
-TRAVIS-
Suddenly, in the corner, you see a cloak of dark raven feathers.
(laughter)
I've come to collect!
-LIAM-
All your characters are going to--
-MATT-
There we go.
-TRAVIS-
There's something familiar about you.
-MATT-
You must use the new roll.
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's a one.
-ROBBIE-
Wow.
-LIAM-
So that is--
-MATT-
It happened!
-LIAM-
Then it's a 20 to hit.
-MATT-
20 to hit... does hit.
-LIAM-
Does hit? Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Let's make it a tripping attack.
-MATT-
Sure.
-ROBBIE-
Tripping?
-LAURA-
That's doable.
That's definitely doable.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
They be tripping.
-LIAM-
I know the story of David and Goliath.
So that is 11 plus--
-ASHLEY-
Straight tripping.
-LIAM-
That is cocked.
That's 14 points of damage, and now he's got to make a strength save, I believe.
-ASHLEY-
David and Goliath.
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Strength save.
-MATT-
21.
-ASHLEY-
Where's that slingshot you got me?
-LIAM-
Saves, doesn't affect.
-MATT-
So you strike him in the back of the leg, and it cuts through where the Achilles tendon would be, and as its leg splits and almost buckles for a second, its bones snap and it pushes it back together and you watch it seal over slightly, and it pulls itself back up.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh!
-LIAM-
So I went five, 10, 15, 20, 25.
I'm going to back away.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
That's the end of my turn.
-MATT-
You got it.
You just left its melee range when you did that, so it's going to take--
-LIAM-
15 feet is its melee range.
-LAURA-
Zoinks.
-TRAVIS-
Called it!
-MATT-
It's going to take a swing at you, since you goaded it anyway.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 23 to hit.
-LIAM-
Yeah, bruv.
-TRAVIS-
Damn!
-LAURA-
No!
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Woof.
-MATT-
So you take--
-TALIESIN-
Shit, brah.
-ROBBIE-
Naur!
-ALL-
Naur!
-TRAVIS-
Stay away from the hammer.
-MATT-
Okay. (laughs)
-LAURA-
Uh-oh.
-LIAM-
All that math.
-TRAVIS-
When he pauses--
-LAURA-
Yeah, this isn't good.
-ROBBIE-
Carrying the one.
-ASHLEY-
His math is fast.
This is bad.
-MATT-
33 points of bludgeoning damage, and I need you to make a strength saving throw for me.
-TRAVIS-
They're playing croquet with Orym!
-ROBBIE-
Heavy hitter.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I know where I'm going next.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Hold on one second.
-LAURA-
Get rid of it.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going full speed at that fuck.
-TRAVIS-
♪ I'm going to be ♪ But if you leave, doesn't that mean--
-LIAM-
All right, that's a one.
I'll reroll it.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Does this thing have eyes?
-LIAM-
That's pretty good.
-TALIESIN-
Don't tell me about the bugs.
-LIAM-
So this a strength save, you said?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
24.
-MATT-
24, as the hammer slams you, you put your shield up, and you take the impact.
It rocks your body, and your bones across your entire skeleton shake from the impact.
You skid back about six inches, but you hold your ground.
It almost golf clubbed you back.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-LIAM-
I rolled a 19.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!
-MATT-
All righty.
That finish your go?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right, now it's Essek's go.
-ASHLEY-
Come on, hot boi.
-MATT-
Essek, seeing this happen here--
-ASHLEY-
Hot boi, hot boi.
-MATT-
-- is going to go ahead and-- Some of his good stuff here.
-LIAM-
Flashy.
-ROBBIE-
Look away.
-LIAM-
Do not go quietly into the night.
-MATT-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
We will not go quietly, without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!
-ASHLEY-
We will not weaken or falter.
-TRAVIS-
Today we celebrate our Independence Day.
-MATT-
He doesn't want to hurt anyone there.
Yeah, you know what? He looks over across this massive cluster and goes, "All right, let's see if I still got it in me.
It's been a minute," and he's going to move forward to the edge, to there.
He's going to begin to cast a spell.
You see the space in front of his hands begin to warp and pull in, like there's either intense heat or intense gravity, and as he pulls his hands together and claps them, he shoots them outward, and you watch this bead of black scatter out in a line.
As it does, the ground beneath goes (consecutive cracking).
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-MATT-
You watch as all the nearby stone and rock gets pulled into the center.
-LAURA-
Yes!
-MATT-
Like gravity suddenly folds.
This massive Gravity Fissure tears across over there.
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-LIAM-
That's dunamancy.
-LAURA-
That's dunamancy!
-MATT-
That's going to be for the damage.
-LIAM-
First.
-MATT-
Ooh, that's a great roll. Okay.
Okay, now I'm rolling saving throws.
It comes through here, which will catch everyone in this area.
Unfortunately, on the opposite end, it might catch you, Fearne.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
So I need you to make, let's see--
-LIAM-
Is it catching Ash, who's in front of that tent?
-TRAVIS-
♪ Resist the black hole sun ♪
-MATT-
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
Me?
-MATT-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I do have advantage against spells and other magical effects.
-MATT-
That's true, you do.
-ASHLEY-
So, not to brag.
-LAURA-
Is that higher than a 3rd-level spell?
-MATT-
It is. I'm going to roll for him in a second.
LAURA and ASHLEY: (nervous oohing)
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to definitely roll that again.
-LAURA-
Does the DC drop or the number drop--
-ASHLEY-
Shit. (laughs)
-LAURA-
-- the higher the level spell? Or is it just--
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
It's always 17?
-MATT-
It's just when a 3rd- or higher-level spell is cast.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Six.
-MATT-
Six, that's a fail.
-ASHLEY-
That's with advantage.
-MATT-
All right, so you take 36 points--
-MATT-
-- of force damage.
-TRAVIS-
Nasty.
(surprised squealing)
-ROBBIE-
That's nasty.
-MARISHA-
(valley girl accent) Oh my god.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Fail.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MATT-
Fail.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, he's going to fucking plow her over.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
Fail.
-LIAM-
Oh wow.
-LAURA-
This is good.
-MATT-
Fail.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-ASHLEY-
I knew I shouldn't have rolled that one.
You know when you have that feeling and you still do it?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm, yep.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-ROBBIE-
Whoa.
-TRAVIS-
Damn!
-ROBBIE-
Ah, thanks buddy.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
Tears through all of those.
-ROBBIE-
You planned that, right?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's okay, I'll take the damage if they're all going to fail.
-TRAVIS-
Changes the game.
-ASHLEY-
It does, it does.
-LIAM-
I hate to throw a player under the bus, but do you see Ashton in front of the tent? Because he's right in there with those bugs.
-MATT-
Oh no, yeah, Ashton would be there too.
Ashton, could you roll a constitution saving throw?
-TRAVIS-
Ah!
-MATT-
Yeah, as I was standing here, the edge of it was blocking him.
-TRAVIS-
Big con save, baby.
-ASHLEY-
Come on, come on.
-TRAVIS-
Big con save, nipples out.
-LIAM-
Come on.
-TALIESIN-
I don't have advantage on this, it's just a straight save?
-MATT-
Correct.
-TRAVIS-
Force nipples.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
That's, I can't read that because I'm old. It's 15?
-MATT-
15 is a failure.
-TRAVIS-
Ah.
-MATT-
It was 36--
-ASHLEY-
36.
-MATT-
-- points of force damage.
-TALIESIN-
I take all 36, don't I?
-MATT-
Yeah, because it's force.
-TALIESIN-
Yes, I do.
-MATT-
You get pulled (whoosh) right in to where the middle of the line was.
-ASHLEY-
Ugh.
-TALIESIN-
Ow.
-MATT-
Your gravity against that gravity, you watch the two converge and as it hits you, the force damage hits, you watch as you get knocked out of the way.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I do not like that.
-MATT-
Your head sparks and you (whoosh) get pulled in the middle and as you land, the colors of your rage mingle across a rainbow for a second before reforming, the dunamancy meeting dunamancy and having an odd reaction.
(oohing)
-TALIESIN-
I throw up.
-MATT-
He goes "Sorry."
-LIAM-
Fruity Pebbles.
-MATT-
To that point, I'm going to, actually someone roll for me because that's fun.
Roll a d20 for Essek.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-LIAM-
That's a cocked 20, so I'll roll it again.
-LAURA-
It was cocked.
-LIAM-
That's cocked.
Seven plus something.
-MATT-
Okay.
Okay, so yeah, that doesn't matter.
He's going to dart back to there and (swoosh) hover back a little bit.
-TALIESIN-
That's not good.
-MATT-
Hoping that maybe he didn't catch too much attention.
Finishing his go, it's now the larger entity's turn.
-LIAM-
Oof.
-LAURA-
Big boy, okay.
Big boy's over by Essek.
-TALIESIN-
I got pulled over there?
-MATT-
Hmm? You got pulled there.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MATT-
Yeah.
It's going to, you goading attacked it.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh.
So it has disadvantage.
-LIAM-
I got its Achilles.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's going to turn around.
-ROBBIE-
All right, boys.
-LIAM-
Its Achilles.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
You ready for a scrap? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Did you lead him to us?
-LAURA-
Oh god, it's coming over here.
-TRAVIS-
Did you come back to the hole?
-ROBBIE-
It's us.
-MATT-
It turns the corner and it sees you--
-MARISHA-
Did you come back to the hole?
-MATT-
-- and the two others behind.
-TRAVIS-
How'd it go, Orym?
-LIAM-
Whoa.
-TRAVIS-
Oh fuck! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-ROBBIE-
Did you get him?
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-ASHLEY-
That's such a cool mini.
-TRAVIS-
Big Bear chased me.
-MATT-
As it lumbers past, dragging this hammer again, (inertial swoosh) it's going to make a massive swing with an overhead.
-LAURA-
All three of you?
-ROBBIE-
No!
-LIAM-
Holy shit.
-MATT-
The first one is going to be--
-LIAM-
The first one?
-MATT-
Actually, no, it brings its hammer up with its hands and as it brings the hammer there, the center mouth (snarls).
-LAURA-
Ah!
-TRAVIS-
Center mouth?
-MATT-
Is going to attempt to--
-ROBBIE-
It's got a center mouth.
-MATT-
-- it's going to try and lean in as it swings its hammer at other targets and try and clamp onto you as it does.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
I'm just a little snack.
You surely want a bigger meal than me?
-MARISHA-
You are a little snack.
-LAURA-
(laughs) That's right.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 29 to hit.
-LIAM-
To hit? It hits.
Sure, it hits.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Did you say 29?
-TALIESIN-
Cool.
-MATT-
29 to hit, yeah.
I rolled really high.
-LIAM-
Is there any kind of save or anything or am I in this guy's guts?
-MATT-
No, so here we go.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I will not answer you.
-ROBBIE-
Well-- (laughter)
-- back that up.
-MATT-
24 points of piercing damage.
-LIAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
And you are grappled.
-LIAM-
Jeez.
-ROBBIE-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
As you are currently in its mouth being chewed.
-TRAVIS-
(screams) Shit!
-ROBBIE-
No!
-LAURA-
Chewed?
-MATT-
As it bends, it swings down--
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay. I'm so sorry.
-MATT-
-- it does this massive hammer swing to try hit Dorian.
As it does, it leans forward--
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-MATT-
And (gurgles) envelops Orym for a second and it's going to swing for you--
-LAURA-
Does that mean you can hit it?
-MATT-
With the rest of the hammer swing.
That's going to be--
-LIAM-
I don't know.
It depends on the roll.
-MATT-
20 to hit.
-ROBBIE-
(cheerfully) Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
(mimicking Robbie) Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Shit.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That's going to be--
-ROBBIE-
With the hammer?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Ugh.
-ROBBIE-
Ha ha.
-MATT-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
Cool.
-LIAM-
He's at disadvantage with everybody.
You remember that, right?
-MATT-
Oh, that's right, yeah, with anybody else but you.
That's going to be, that's a higher roll. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Ooh.
-MATT-
Sorry.
-LIAM-
That's all right.
-MATT-
20 and 23.
-TALIESIN-
Anybody got some Bane?
-LAURA-
What's your AC?
-ROBBIE-
(scoffs)
-LAURA-
So high?
-ROBBIE-
I got hit.
-MATT-
28 points of bludgeoning damage.
I need you to make a strength saving throw for me.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Shit.
-LAURA-
Otherwise, you go flying.
-TRAVIS-
Matt, as this creature walks over--
-ROBBIE-
I'm strong.
-TRAVIS-
-- does he look like he's made of organic stuffs from first glance, or does he look like he's made of metal or stone?
-MATT-
No, looks to be organic.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-ROBBIE-
I can say fuck.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As it steps over the giant hanging jowls, (blubbering) the skin just flaps.
You can see where its arms are, they're thin almost like there's almost no musculature in the arm and at the joints, it's thick and wiry.
The fingers are far too long and almost wrap around the fist a second time when it's clutching onto the hammer.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
It's awful.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-TALIESIN-
Did the fire--
-MATT-
So?
-ROBBIE-
10.
-TALIESIN-
-- extra damage, or no?
-MATT-
All right, so 10.
-LAURA-
He didn't say it did.
-MATT-
As it swings the hammer--
-TALIESIN-
Shit.
-MATT-
-- you try and duck out of the way.
It's trying to actually bell slam you into the dome next to you.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-MATT-
As you try and leap out of the way, it catches you and sends you flying back through the ruin (crash).
(oohing)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god!
-MATT-
You break through into the opposite side (thud) and hit the wall.
-TRAVIS-
Thank you.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, sure.
-MARISHA-
Wow.
-MATT-
You are prone.
-ROBBIE-
Prone.
-MATT-
Which it takes half your movement to get up.
So you're like (crash) (groan), fallen to the ground on the inside, breaking through the stonework behind you.
That's going to finish its turn, leaving it now--
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
-- with Orym being chewed in its stomach, its absence of face (slobbery low growl) looks over towards you.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, a big scrotum jaw?
-ASHLEY-
Ugh, the swinging.
-MATT-
Yep.
-TRAVIS-
Cool.
-MATT-
Finishing its go, Dorian, now you're up, with Imogen on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Amazing.
-ROBBIE-
So I just got hit through the wall, I'm prone.
Okay.
Let me see if I'm understanding this correctly, never done it.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck a duck.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, good.
So I get up and dust myself off and there's no top of that dome, right?
-MATT-
Of this?
-ROBBIE-
Where I'm inside of that thing.
-MATT-
Oh, where you are? There is a staircase that leads to an upper area if you wanted to.
-TALIESIN-
But there's no roof?
-MATT-
There's no roof to it.
-ROBBIE-
There's no roof.
-LIAM-
You can stand on top and see him.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
In fact, boy, can you see him.
-ROBBIE-
And Orym's currently in his mouth?
-MATT-
Yeah, the stomach-mouth.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, I am going to engage my winged boots and use my movement to go straight up through to the top of the things and he's bloodied and battered and I want him to hover at eye level with him and I'm going to try, I have to, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at--
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-ROBBIE-
Fuck.
5th-level.
-LAURA-
Can I, wait.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
I'm going right after him.
-MATT-
Yeah?
-LAURA-
Can we do a joint attack?
-MATT-
Sure, if you want to.
-LAURA-
Because this is one after the other, can I step up on this rock?
-MATT-
If you want to hold the spell, if you see--
-ROBBIE-
Sure, yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm going to step up--
-ROBBIE-
It's an opportunity.
-LAURA-
-- on this rock in front of me.
-LIAM-
You shout his name as he flies in the air.
-MATT-
Okay, so as you fly up, you start casting the spell and you see Imogen, the glow on the energy and you both make eye contact from across the battlefield.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-LAURA-
I'm going to step up on the rock in front of me.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I imagine I can see his head.
-MATT-
You can see the shoulders and--
-LIAM-
That's awesome.
-MATT-
-- head from above there.
-LAURA-
Then I'm going to do the exact same thing as Dorian.
-MATT-
What level?
-LAURA-
And hit him with a Lightning Bolt, 5th-level on the other side.
-MATT-
Two 5th-level Lightning Bolts just (crackle).
-ASHLEY-
Cool!
-MARISHA-
(claps)
-MATT-
All right, so both of you describe how these bolts interact with the creature.
-ROBBIE-
Right as we're casting, I'm going to yell: Aim for the head! Because Orym's in the body.
-LAURA-
Got it!
-ROBBIE-
Yep.
-MATT-
Four and a three, it fails both of your saves.
-ALL-
Yeah! (cheering)
-MARISHA-
Tag team!
-ROBBIE-
But do we have to do a thing if it's a high level?
-MATT-
After this you do, but let's roll damage first.
-LAURA-
Okay, but we roll it?
-ROBBIE-
Roll damage first?
-MATT-
Yeah, so 5th-level, that's 10d6 lightning damage from each of you.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
That's what I got.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
I got more right here.
-LAURA-
Two, three, four, five, six.
-ROBBIE-
Do good.
-LAURA-
Huh!
-ROBBIE-
Ooh! Oh, that's pretty good.
-MARISHA-
Oh, it's down.
-ROBBIE-
I lost one.
-MARISHA-
It's down!
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, that's real good.
-ROBBIE-
That's real good.
-LAURA-
Nine.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, that's real good!
-ROBBIE-
Oh, that's real good! Okay.
-LAURA-
Good, good, good.
-ROBBIE-
Let's go.
-LIAM-
Were you ever--
-LAURA-
Oh, this is really good, too!
-ASHLEY-
Oh jeez!
-LAURA-
Holy shit!
-ASHLEY-
You guys both rolled really good.
-LIAM-
-- hold someone's hand--
-ROBBIE-
That's four sixes.
-LIAM-
-- while they touched a live socket?
-LAURA-
Oh my god, I got four sixes, too!
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, great.
Six, six, 24.
-MATT-
I live for this excitement.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) Yeah, 32.
-LAURA-
34.
-ROBBIE-
Six.
-MARISHA-
Shouldn't have gotten eaten.
-ROBBIE-
38.
-LAURA-
Wait, shut up.
I can't count.
-ROBBIE-
40 on the nose.
-MATT-
40 lightning damage, ooh.
-MARISHA-
Ooh!
-TRAVIS-
What's that?
-LAURA-
42.
-MATT-
Ooh!
-ROBBIE-
Is yours purple?
-LAURA-
Yeah, mine's purple.
-ROBBIE-
What color does purple and yellow make? I don't know, but it's pretty!
-LAURA-
I don't know, but it's so cool.
-MATT-
So your bolt is a bright, yellowish white light?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, just a literal lightning bolt.
-MATT-
Yeah, so you both wait until the exact moment and (electric booming) the entire--
-TRAVIS-
(resonating electricity)
-MATT-
-- cavern shakes with the impact of both of these hitting on both sides and as they hit the creature and both strike through its body, they both mingle.
-LAURA-
His head.
-MATT-
Yeah, well the head and the torso, it shocks through it and both of them (bolts roar) continue shooting out each side.
The power is immense and you both almost (crackle) arc off to the side as you finish it--
-ASHLEY-
So cool.
-MATT-
-- like a Ghostbusters beam being pulled off.
They both (electric crackle) splinter off before fading.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Nice shooting there, Tex.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
As mine dissipates, there's twinges of little bits of red light that fizzle off of it.
-MATT-
(static crackles) Cool.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh!
-MATT-
It looks a little hurt, it's looking a little hurt.
-TRAVIS-
Are you going to ask?
-ROBBIE-
High five.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, how many points of damage was that?
-TRAVIS-
I know. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
I need you both to roll d20s for me.
-LAURA-
It was 42.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah. This is where it gets--
-ASHLEY-
That was 82 points of damage together?
-ROBBIE-
-- sketchy though, right?
-MATT-
It might.
-ASHLEY-
God, that was good.
-ROBBIE-
I have not rolled a single good d20, but that all changes now!
-LAURA-
Roll low, roll low!
-MARISHA-
You want to roll low.
You want to roll low.
-ROBBIE-
Oh good, I rolled so low!
-MARISHA-
That's good.
You did, you did.
-ASHLEY-
That's good.
-LAURA-
Is that cocked? Is mine cocked?
-MARISHA-
Little. (laughs)
-LIAM-
That's cocked.
-MATT-
No. Okay.
-LAURA-
That's not cocked.
-MARISHA-
It was him.
Teacher. Teacher, him.
-MATT-
Can you place a dice on it and it stays?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's a good rule.
-MATT-
Like a d6?
-LIAM-
Oh, I would've kept so many 20s.
-TRAVIS-
Ah.
-LIAM-
Ope! It's gone.
-TRAVIS-
The first try.
-TALIESIN-
It was at an angle.
-LAURA-
A d6, a d6!
-TALIESIN-
It was at an angle.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Don't do it again.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
No, no.
If it fell off, it's cocked.
So go ahead and roll it again.
-ROBBIE-
Do it.
-LAURA-
I feel like--
-ASHLEY-
I feel like that was a little weird.
-TALIESIN-
I was looking at it.
-LAURA-
I feel like if I see it--
-TALIESIN-
It looked cocked from here.
-LAURA-
-- and I can read it, it's not cocked, but--
-MATT-
If you see it and you can read it?
-LIAM-
Holy shit.
-LAURA-
It looked like a 20.
-TRAVIS-
Laura Bailey.
-ROBBIE-
Are you debating with yourself?
-MATT-
No.
Look, here's the thing.
I honor the fact if you can tell what number it's supposed to be--
-LIAM-
She's arguing for wild magic.
-LAURA-
No, I know.
I'm just saying--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I feel like that was cocked.
-MATT-
If you know what number it should have been, then it's not cocked.
If you can't tell because it's midway between, then it's cocked.
-LAURA-
I feel like it was a 20.
-MATT-
All right. Then roll a d100 for me please.
-ROBBIE-
(heavy exhale)
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
-LAURA-
I feel like it's cheating. It's not--
-LIAM-
Did the electricity conduct through its body--
-LAURA-
-- honoring it if it--
-LIAM-
-- like it would?
-MATT-
Like it naturally would, yeah.
-LIAM-
To me, I'm asking.
-LAURA-
Four.
-MATT-
Oh, to you?
-LIAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
Both lines were shot at an angle where you were below it.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I know, but--
-TALIESIN-
It didn't do a--
-MATT-
Oh, but you're inside its mouth.
-LIAM-
I was a kid and grabbed somebody's hand when they touched an outlet and I got shocked.
-TRAVIS-
There's no saliva in that mouth.
-MATT-
I'll say no because the density of its body, most of the impact was above in the torso area.
You feel the tingling throughout, but--
-LAURA-
It's like putting in a battery.
-MARISHA-
A battery, yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Because it would be lowered, anyway.
-MATT-
Yeah, you feel that throughout the body. Your body goes numb, like you just funny-boned yourself from head-to-toe.
-LAURA-
I might have just fucked myself.
-ROBBIE-
You'll be fine.
-MATT-
But I'm not going to do any damage because you're already in a rougher spot as it is.
-MARISHA-
-- yeah, or butterflies.
-LAURA-
It was in the 40s, if I remember.
-MATT-
From a spell math standpoint, you were outside of the impact of the spell.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Fair ruling.
Fair ruling.
-ROBBIE-
Is that for Wild Shape?
-MARISHA-
For wild magic.
-LAURA-
A four?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
It's a d100 table and--
-MATT-
Oh, what?
-LAURA-
What did I do?
-ROBBIE-
Fun?
-LAURA-
Oh no, what did I do?
-MATT-
You stand up, (intense electric crackling) and those red lights around your fingers that glow begin to brighten and then curl up and then gather right in the middle of your chest and you're like, "What?" (booming explosion) A Fireball explodes where you are.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Oh shit!
-ALL-
(exclaiming)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god!
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-LAURA-
I am fucked! (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-ASHLEY-
Oh no!
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Dorian is across the way wincing, waiting for it to happen to him.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god! Yeah.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Dorian's like, (bolt roars) "Ooh, that was pretty bad."
-TALIESIN-
You should get that looked at.
-TRAVIS-
(massive explosion)
-ASHLEY-
Ah!
-MATT-
Make a dexterity saving throw for me.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Laudna, make a dexterity saving throw for me.
-MARISHA-
Oh no!
-LAURA-
Oh no, Laudna!
-MATT-
(laughs) That creature is going to make one as well.
-TRAVIS-
New campaign, some things never change.
-ROBBIE-
Don't kill your girlfriend.
-MARISHA-
I know, I was going to say is this because we're in a fight?
-LAURA-
♪ Don't kill your girlfriend ♪ ♪ Don't kill your girl-- ♪
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that's cocked.
-LAURA-
Is that cocked? (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Natural one for that dude.
-LAURA-
That one's cocked.
That is cocked.
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
15.
-LAURA-
I should have taken the cocked!
-LIAM-
I'm not going to say anything.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MATT-
This is really bad.
-TALIESIN-
How did you get there before she did? That was amazing.
-LAURA-
I know, I'm under stress.
-TALIESIN-
Normally you live there.
-LAURA-
I'm stressed!
-MATT-
Okay.
What'd you roll?
-LAURA-
13.
-MATT-
13?
-LAURA-
No, that's a lie.
(groans) 11.
-MATT-
11.
19 points of fire damage to you.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
15, you're fine on that one.
-TRAVIS-
Hey, Robbie.
-MATT-
Well no, it's based on your spell save.
So that that would beat it, right?
-LAURA-
Oh, 19 is my spell save.
-MATT-
Yeah.
So you also take--
-MARISHA-
Okay. Okay, okay.
-MATT-
-- 19 points of fire damage.
-LAURA-
Sorry. Sorry.
-MATT-
That creature over there also takes 19 points of fire damage.
It's still standing, but it's hurt.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, and the scorpions?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
One of them got hit and is like: (intense sizzling) still smoldering as the flames are burning around.
You can see its normally translucent torso is now blackened and opaque from the fire damage.
-LAURA-
♪ At least I'm not as sheep ♪ ♪ At least I'm not as sheep ♪
-MATT-
That's true.
-ASHLEY-
That's true, that's true.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your go.
-TALIESIN-
Baa.
-MATT-
You can still move, if you'd like.
-ROBBIE-
Also, can I technically finish my turn?
-MATT-
Oh yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Since Imogen jumped in, would that be okay?
-MATT-
Sure, I'll allow that.
Yeah, go for it.
-LAURA-
Do it.
-ROBBIE-
If not, that's okay.
-ROBBIE-
I would want to go, horrified by what just happened, I go: Chet, I think we hurt it! Then do Bardic Inspiration.
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Whoa.
-ROBBIE-
Oh wait, no, sorry.
I need a 10, not a 100.
-LAURA-
Nice, nice.
-MATT-
Either works fine.
-ROBBIE-
Sweet.
-TRAVIS-
This is great.
-ROBBIE-
Sweet.
-TRAVIS-
This is for damage or to hit?
-ROBBIE-
For Bardic Inspiration?
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's ability checks--
-ROBBIE-
Yep.
-MATT-
-- saving throws--
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Let me just double-check.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
I don't know if--
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
Even after all that damage, it didn't drop you?
-MATT-
All righty.
-ROBBIE-
Sweet.
-TALIESIN-
Okay. That amount of damage didn't make him upchuck a little bit?
-LIAM-
I'll take the fact that I did not get massively electrocuted.
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Fair, okay.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to make some tactics.
-ROBBIE-
We knew it would work.
-MATT-
No, I get that.
-TRAVIS-
That's a very good point.
-MATT-
Yeah, there's a difference between being swallowed and grappled.
He's not inside of its body, he can still do everything.
He's not restrained, he's just grappled to him.
He's just in the mouth holding it off.
-LIAM-
If anything, it probably went: (jaws clench).
-TALIESIN-
You're being macerated, not swallowed.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
There's a lot of maceration.
-MATT-
It's in the process of chewing him more than it has swallowed him.
Most creatures, it would be if it takes enough damage, then it'll vomit something up, but not in this particular instance.
All right, so finishing that, Dorian, Imogen, you still have movement, if you want.
-LAURA-
♪ I'm going to stay where I am ♪
-MATT-
You got it.
All right, finishing that, Chetney, you're up, with Laudna on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'm still hiding behind the booble.
-MATT-
Right over here, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
But this is all horrible.
People are getting fucking Topgolfed all over the place.
-MARISHA-
Topgolfed.
-MATT-
In the same moment, two bolts of lighting went (crackle) and then (sizzle).
-TRAVIS-
Dorian's like (sizzle).
-MATT-
Yep. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Ah!
-MATT-
It's a little intense here.
-TRAVIS-
What's the distance between me and the edge of the mini? Am I in his 15-foot melee?
-MATT-
You are just outside of his 15-foot melee.
-TRAVIS-
Just outside, then fuck that, I ain't going in there.
I'm going to take the scythe and cast Shatter.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Against him, which is a con--
-MARISHA-
Nice.
-TRAVIS-
15 saving throw.
-MATT-
Okay.
What's the radius on the Shatter spell?
-TRAVIS-
It is a 10-foot sphere.
-MATT-
A 10-foot sphere, okay.
-TRAVIS-
So I'll put it just behind him so it gets him in the back and on the hammer as well.
-MATT-
Gotcha.
Okay, yeah, so you can throw it probably through the legs and hit the edge of the tent.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
To not hit Orym is the question because he's inside its mouth.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, please.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
On his backside, if I could.
-MATT-
Yep, you got it.
You can do that.
A constitution saving throw.
-LAURA-
♪ Shatter up the butt ♪
-MATT-
That's going to be a 15 constitution saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
That meets it.
-MATT-
Okay, yeah, so it's half damage.
-TRAVIS-
Eight, 13, and one more, that's a seven, amazing.
20, so 10.
10 points of thunder damage.
-MATT-
10 points of thunder damage.
You got it.
-TRAVIS-
With my bonus action, I'll be like (snarls) and do my hybrid transformation and I will fucking run away through that little crack between the mountain and the fort doing this number.
(rapid high-pitched sliding) Between the wall, actually no, no, yeah, towards Taliesin, in through the crack between--
-MATT-
Oh, I see.
-TRAVIS-
-- the little pieces.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-LAURA-
(chuckles)
-MATT-
In here?
-TRAVIS-
No, no, no.
-MATT-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
Further back.
-MATT-
Oh, up here?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, through there.
-MATT-
Oh, towards Taliesin.
I'm sorry, I was looking at Ashton. Sorry.
-TALIESIN-
Other Taliesin, jeez.
Right there, that's great.
-MATT-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
I don't even use all the-- (uncertain noise)
-TALIESIN-
Cheesy.
-TRAVIS-
I will use the rest of the speed to climb up on that little ledge.
-MATT-
All right. There you go.
-TRAVIS-
Right there, yeah.
-MATT-
So you (grunt) clamber up the side, get on top and get a better overall survey of the battlefield before you--
-TRAVIS-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
Great.
Finishing your go, Laudna, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
Remember, they spit acid--
-MATT-
Then we're back up to Ashton.
-TALIESIN-
-- if they're too close.
-MARISHA-
Okay. I'm going to turn behind Imogen.
I'm going to be like: That was a good idea, even though it hurt a little.
I'm going to ♪ Do something ♪ I haven't done ♪ ♪ New toys, new toys ♪ I'm going to--
-ASHLEY-
♪ I haven't done ♪ ♪ New toys ♪
-MARISHA-
-- do Void Puppet.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-MARISHA-
So you see--
-TRAVIS-
You wouldn't!
-MARISHA-
I would!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
Laudna lets out an eardrum-bursting banshee scream that I am not going to do.
-LAURA-
(muffled banshee scream)
-MARISHA-
You see a spirit--
-ASHLEY-
(brief shout)
-MARISHA-
Yeah! (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
That's it.
-LIAM-
We just have that on tap at all times.
-TALIESIN-
And broken.
-MARISHA-
You see a spirit pulse from her body and go screaming through--
-LAURA-
Sick.
-MARISHA-
-- these guys.
-ASHLEY-
Cool!
-MARISHA-
It's going to go right there.
-ROBBIE-
Cool!
-ASHLEY-
(muted banshee scream)
-MARISHA-
As a screaming spirit goes (screeches and then--
-MATT-
Which spirit from Laudna's past does it appear as?
-MARISHA-
What spirit from Laudna's past?
-LAURA-
What?!
-MATT-
Things you know that have passed or things that you've killed that have passed.
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-MATT-
The spirit always appears as something that you've been connected to its demise.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's really cool.
That's really cool.
-TALIESIN-
Part of the tree house gang?
-MARISHA-
I think for this one you would see in its ghostly ethereal form, a noose around its neck that is trailing behind it, almost like a tail, and it looks like a blonde, maybe halfling, younger woman that was hung with Laudna on the tree that day.
-TRAVIS-
Ah.
-ASHLEY-
(gasps)
-MATT-
Mm.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right. So that's your--
-LAURA-
You're pointing at yourself.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, it is me!
-MATT-
-- bonus action.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Even I knew that.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I was right.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
So that's your bonus action.
-MARISHA-
So as she screams--
-ASHLEY-
That's really cool.
-MARISHA-
Then I'm going to take a few steps back
Then I'm going to take a few steps back and, not knowing that Imogen didn't mean to do this, go (explosion) and also do a Fireball--
-ROBBIE-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
-- right on top of all these guys.
-MATT-
Okay. As you step back--
-MARISHA-
Try and just get rid of them.
-MATT-
-- they do both get attacks of opportunity on you.
-MARISHA-
Then I'll stay.
-TALIESIN-
Not both of them.
One of them doesn't because--
-MATT-
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, one of them that's hit doesn't have a reaction.
The other one does.
-MARISHA-
Then I'll stay.
I can just make it be right on the edge.
-MATT-
Okay.
So you remain--
-ASHLEY-
♪ Right on the edge ♪ MARISHA and TRAVIS: ♪ Of glory ♪
-TALIESIN-
Boy, there's a vibe.
-LAURA-
Robbie, you're like: Why am I here? (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
No!
-MATT-
So right about there.
-ROBBIE-
This is what I want in a game.
-MATT-
You can hit everything in that area.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Great.
-LIAM-
"High" fantasy.
-MATT-
All right. Level three?
-TALIESIN-
High.
-ASHLEY-
(stoner) High fantasy.
-MARISHA-
Level three!
-MATT-
All right, saves on that one.
Fail.
That one, the one that's closest to you.
Natural one!
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
They all have disadvantage because they're near my spirit.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, you--
-MARISHA-
My screaming spirit.
-MATT-
Yeah, they super fail.
The one right there.
-TRAVIS-
Super fail.
-MATT-
Also at disadvantage.
-ASHLEY-
Super fail.
-MATT-
Yeah, rolled a 16 and a natural two.
-MARISHA-
Hey, hey, hey!
-TALIESIN-
Is that the end of those, or--?
-MATT-
She hasn't rolled damage yet.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
(vocalizing)
-TRAVIS-
(air horn)
-MARISHA-
Let's see.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
As sorcerer points, what can I do? What can I? Hang on.
I haven't done this in a second.
-TRAVIS-
(gruffly) What do you mean hang on?
-MARISHA-
"Empower Spell. When you roll damage for a new spell, you can spend one to reroll up to five of your dice." (laughter)
Yeah, I'm going to spend a sorcery point because I want these guys--
-MATT-
To empower it?
-MARISHA-
-- dead.
-MATT-
All right, so choose five of those dice to reroll.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I'm going to get rid of this one, two, three, four.
Ah, I'll keep the three.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Four.
All right, come on, baby, come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hi-yah, hi-yah.
(laughter)
And I just turn into Butthead.
-TALIESIN-
That's scarier.
What's happening now is the scariest thing.
-MARISHA-
10.
-ASHLEY-
I love when Matt--
-MARISHA-
22.
-MATT-
That's fire damage.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I love it so much.
-MARISHA-
25.
-ASHLEY-
God, I love it.
-MATT-
It's classic.
-MARISHA-
25 plus 12 is 37.
-MATT-
That's 37.
-MARISHA-
38 damage.
-LAURA-
Woo!
-ASHLEY-
Yes, baby!
-LAURA-
Sexy!
-ASHLEY-
Cool!
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
Okay, that's good, just want to--
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Ruin and--
-MARISHA-
So see--
-MATT-
The tent is on fire.
(laughter)
-ALL-
♪ The tent, the tent, the tent is on fire ♪ (laughter)
-MARISHA-
I'm going to cower. (laughs) I'm going to slip behind this boulder and just (exhales).
-MATT-
Right here or back this way?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's fine.
Just where I still want to be able to...
-MATT-
Yeah, you can still see.
It's half cover from there.
-MARISHA-
See what's happening.
-MATT-
All right then.
-MARISHA-
I can still see the big guy?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
You know what? I--
-MATT-
Well, actually from where you are, you would <i>not</i> be able to.
The angle's at a point where--
-MARISHA-
Let me actually then move, five, 10, 15--
-TALIESIN-
Not great.
-LIAM-
Not great.
-MATT-
Yeah.
With Ashton there, you have an angle where you can see it.
-TALIESIN-
A little bit, but eventually I'm going to--
-MARISHA-
I'm going to move one more, 25, because now can I maybe see my party members? Some of my party members?
-MATT-
Yeah! You can see Dorian up there.
-MARISHA-
Just in case-ies?
-MATT-
You can.
The only one you can't see is Orym, and that's because he's facing away.
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your go?
-MARISHA-
Yep, that's my go.
-MATT-
Ashton, you're up!
-TALIESIN-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
With Fearne on deck.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, yeah.
-MATT-
Since all the skitterlings are dead.
-TALIESIN-
How far away is this guy would you say?
-MATT-
How what?
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to see how far away this guy is from me.
All the little creepy crawlies are gone?
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
He's kind of far, isn't he?
-MATT-
He's about 50 feet from you.
-TALIESIN-
That'll do it.
I am going to trigger a Hyper Rage, and I am going to start going out of focus, vibrating at high speed, and then there's going to be--
-MATT-
Did you get speed earlier?
-TALIESIN-
I got, it's time, yeah, I got time.
-MATT-
Or time, yeah.
The earlier one was gravity? Or that was?
-TALIESIN-
No, there was no gravity.
-MATT-
The one that reduced your time? I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You're good, you're good.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that's just the standard.
-MATT-
Yeah, I was trying to remember which one that was.
You're good.
-TALIESIN-
My-- Yeah.
So starting to get a little out of phase, and then a long red line of light like a Tron bicycle hops over there and appears out of nowhere.
You see a blue phase-y shift version of Ashton who waves very slowly at you while I scoot full fucking speed at that asshole.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, cool!
-ROBBIE-
Nice!
-LIAM-
Oh wow.
-MATT-
That's cool.
-TALIESIN-
As if time bends, there's still a little blue trail behind me still waving at you a little bit as I take a 25, I take the straight--
-MATT-
Roll d20 for me.
-TALIESIN-
-- attack
-TRAVIS-
Ray Chase-ing.
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's right! Ray Chase-ing. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Ray Tracing.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, you made it magic.
-MARISHA-
I made it magic.
-MATT-
I love Ray Chase-ing.
-MARISHA-
Five.
-LAURA-
Yay!
-MATT-
All right, you're fine.
-TRAVIS-
Nothing bad happens on a five.
-TALIESIN-
I think I'm going to take...
[surprisingly loud thunk]
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no! (laughter)
-MATT-
You thought you were free with Marisha on the other side of the table.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Are you okay?
-TRAVIS-
10 pound dice roll?
-LIAM-
Yes!
-TRAVIS-
What was it?
-ROBBIE-
Right, hit a funny bone?
-LIAM-
My wrist bone!
-ASHLEY-
Oh, ow!
-TALIESIN-
I hit him with a die.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Solid. That's the ball bearing dice?
-LIAM-
That's the big--
-ROBBIE-
Finally.
-MATT-
(laughs) That was incredible.
-LIAM-
This motherfucker.
That hit me! (oohing)
-TALIESIN-
It's not that bad.
Oh, Jesus.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
No, anywhere except the bone, right?
-LAURA-
Ow.
-MATT-
Taking two attacks?
-TALIESIN-
I am taking my first attack, but I'm using the belt, so I'm going to get an extra d6, but I'm also taking advantage on this.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Gonna use a belt ♪
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
So, because I want this to hit really bad.
That's--
-LIAM-
Ooh, it hits?
-MATT-
So you're going reckless?
-TALIESIN-
28.
Yeah, I'm going reckless.
-MATT-
28 hits.
-TALIESIN-
28 to hit.
That means they have to do a strength save.
They're huge size, right?
-MATT-
They are huge, yes.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, so yeah, they need a strength save.
-MATT-
Strength save will put it at a 16.
-TALIESIN-
It's a 17.
-MATT-
That's a fail.
-TALIESIN-
So I'm going to do my damage first.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh! One second.
It's 12, 24.
It's 25 points of damage.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
He's pushed 15 feet away from me.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-ASHLEY-
Damn.
-TALIESIN-
Then how much--
-TRAVIS-
(like Laura) Wow!
-LAURA-
(Valley girl) You can push really big things.
-TALIESIN-
Then--
-MATT-
You are still technically grappled because you didn't push him out of where you were held by him.
Actually, you were right there when you attacked him, so--
-LIAM-
I would go with his body, yeah?
-MATT-
Well, if you knock something away from a grapple, you might tear yourself free, but he's so big that you push him still within range.
-TALIESIN-
He's more than one size larger than me, so I can't do something else weird, can I?
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, that was--
-MATT-
More than one size larger.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to then, so that's how many feet have I run?
-MATT-
50.
-TALIESIN-
50? Okay.
I got 80 feet, so I might as well play with it.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to hop up and get one more fucking hit.
-TRAVIS-
♪ One more fucking hit ♪
-TALIESIN-
That's 26, 27.
-MATT-
27, that definitely hits as well.
Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Then that's an extra eight, nine, 10, that's 20 more points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice!
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to back the fuck up, straight back.
-MATT-
How far?
-TALIESIN-
As far as I can go, which is the rest of my 80 feet.
-MATT-
Well it was, 50, 60, 55, 60, 65.
-TALIESIN-
70, 75, 80.
-MATT-
75, 80.
That takes you just outside of his hammer range.
-TALIESIN-
That's fine, because I technically can't trigger, while I'm doing this, I don't provoke opportunity attacks.
-MATT-
Then there you go, you're great.
-TRAVIS-
Why you so nasty?
-TALIESIN-
(evil laughs) So that's my vibe.
-TRAVIS-
You nasty.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your go.
Now Fearne, you're up, with Orym on deck.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so--
-TRAVIS-
Let them have it, Fearnie!
-ASHLEY-
All right.
Well I would love to move the Flaming Sphere, but I don't know if it'll hit now at 30 feet?
-MATT-
At 30? Unfortunately, I think he just got pushed out of the range of your Flaming Sphere.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
No, no, no, that's okay.
All right.
Scratch that.
-MATT-
You can still get Ashton with it, though.
-ASHLEY-
I am going to bamf out Mister then with my bonus action.
-MATT-
All righty.
-ASHLEY-
What I'm going to do is--
-MATT-
How far away can you throw him in? 60 feet was it?
-ASHLEY-
I can throw him in at...
Boy oh boy, I don't know if I know that.
Let me see.
-MATT-
It's in the ability for him.
Summon Wildfire Spirit.
-TALIESIN-
Where does he attack?
-ASHLEY-
Nope, that's Wild Shape.
That's why it's not showing up.
I'm really sorry.
-TALIESIN-
Where is the big guy?
-LIAM-
Where is the big guy? Oh, in the order? After-- I don't remember.
-LAURA-
It's probably, it should be...
-MATT-
He attacks after Essek.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, thank you. Okay.
-LIAM-
Between Orym and Essek.
-LAURA-
60 feet, it might say up here.
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-LAURA-
With the intentions, no 30 feet.
-ASHLEY-
30 feet, okay.
-MATT-
30 feet, okay.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, so--
-MATT-
You can move and then summon him, if you want.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, so I'm going to move so I can see Big Boy.
-MATT-
About there next to Laudna is where it'll be.
-MARISHA-
(screams)
-MATT-
You can drop him there.
-ASHLEY-
So I can move 35 feet.
-MATT-
Okay, yeah.
So you can move.
-MARISHA-
Did I scare you?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so I am going to now Scorching Marisha Ray.
(laughter)
I'm going to do that at...
-TRAVIS-
Recharge whatever you can.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to do it at 3rd-level.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
From Mister? You can do that?
-MATT-
No, this is from her.
-ASHLEY-
This is from me, but I--
-LAURA-
Oh, it goes super far!
-ASHLEY-
It goes super far.
-MATT-
It's 120 feet, I'm pretty sure.
-ASHLEY-
120 feet, yeah.
So.
-MATT-
Now because he got pushed back that far, he has half cover, so just know he has a little bit of an AC bonus.
He's still a big target, but just be aware.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-ASHLEY-
Say that one more time?
-TRAVIS-
So he's hiding behind--
-MATT-
You can only see the upper part of his body, because where you're standing the tent is still blocking most of him.
So slightly harder to hit, but not too bad.
It's just a plus two to his AC.
-ASHLEY-
Well, wait, because I also have rogue, can I--
-MARISHA-
Wait.
-ASHLEY-
I can dash.
-MATT-
You can dash?
-LIAM-
As a bonus?
-MATT-
You used your bonus action to call--
-ASHLEY-
To bamf out Mister.
Okay, never mind.
That's right, okay.
So what I'll do, Scorching Marisha Ray then.
-MATT-
All right.
At level three, so that's four attacks you roll for, right?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Okay.
-MATT-
Or is it? Let me see, hold on.
Scorching Ray.
-ASHLEY-
Um.
What did I say, 3rd-level?
-MATT-
Yeah, so it's one additional ray per one, yeah, that's correct.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
First hit is 28.
-MATT-
That's a hit.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Second hit, probably not.
14?
-MATT-
14 misses.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
For sure.
-ASHLEY-
Second hit again is 28.
-LAURA-
28.
-MATT-
Hits.
-ASHLEY-
Fourth is--
-LAURA-
Cocked.
-ASHLEY-
Cocked.
-LIAM-
Cocked.
-MARISHA-
Cocked.
-ASHLEY-
22.
-MATT-
Hits.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so three hits.
-MATT-
So 6d6 fire damage against him.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
All right, all right, so 12, 13, 14.
17 points of fire damage.
-MATT-
Fair enough.
-ASHLEY-
Wait! But I also get, because Mister's out.
-LAURA-
Yay!
-ROBBIE-
But wait, there's more!
-ASHLEY-
I think it's a d8, let me see.
-LAURA-
That's why you bamfed him out!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that's why I did it.
Oh, Enhanced Bond, where you at? Sorry.
-LAURA-
Like an extra 2d8, because he's leveled up?
-ASHLEY-
I think it's just 1d8, but I haven't taken him out in a minute.
I'm so sorry.
Um.
-LAURA-
Click on it.
-ASHLEY-
I was just looking at it and it went, I think it's enhance...
Hold on, I know what to look at.
Features and traits.
Sorry.
-TALIESIN-
When in doubt, Features and Traits.
-ASHLEY-
Roll a d8 and gain a bonus equal to the...
Okay, that's a d8.
Let's do this one.
Seven, seven additional points.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'll take it!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, that's my turn.
(laughter)
-MATT-
(impacts) The flames ripple off of him.
-LAURA-
That was 4th-level?
-TALIESIN-
They don't seem like it.
-MATT-
To no effect.
(gasping)
-TALIESIN-
No fire? No fire. Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Copy that.
-LAURA-
Fire doesn't affect him?
-MARISHA-
The fire didn't work?
-ASHLEY-
The fire didn't do anything?
-MATT-
Did nothing.
Where the flames emerge.
-LAURA-
Oh, all that work? (laughter)
-MATT-
I know, I'm sorry.
-ASHLEY-
That's okay.
-MATT-
I was trying to jump in to say it, but--
-ASHLEY-
That's okay.
-MATT-
I was going to let you look it up and roll the dice, too.
-ASHLEY-
That's okay.
Okay.
-MATT-
Getting a close look now as you're floating above, too, you both struck him with lightning bolts, and they struck him and hit, and they damaged him, but for the severity of that, it should've been more visceral.
-LAURA-
You said he looked rough for a second.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I think--
-MATT-
The damage still crossed a threshold.
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Damage still crossed a threshold.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-ASHLEY-
So, okay.
-TRAVIS-
I hate him.
-LAURA-
Roll a d20.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Are my hits looking okay, or--?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Are they-- Well--
-ASHLEY-
Five.
-MARISHA-
No bueno, no bueno.
-MATT-
Okay, you're fine.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Fuck.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
So--
-ASHLEY-
(blows raspberry)
-MATT-
I know, the Flaming Sphere that hit him earlier, like the impact freaked him out for a minute.
Kind of moved away.
Didn't seem to take much of an effect on it.
The flaming Scorching Rays hitting him, fire does not seem to have much of an effect on him at all, and lightning seems to be a little diminished.
-ASHLEY-
I pass that on.
Um, um, fire doesn't really do anything!
-LAURA-
Fuck.
-ASHLEY-
Fuck!
-MARISHA-
First two things you said, Matt?
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Fire doesn't do anything, lightning is diminished.
He's resistant to lightning.
-MARISHA-
Resistant to lightning.
-MATT-
That's what you gather from this.
And immune to fire.
-LAURA-
Fuck!
-MARISHA-
But then all of your--
-ASHLEY-
He takes no damage from fire?
-TALIESIN-
My stuff seems like it, I seem like I'm giving him a bit of a rock and roll, right? When I'm--
-MATT-
He's taking hits from physical stuff, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, good to know.
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit.
All right.
-LAURA-
Fuck.
-MATT-
Does that finish your go, Fearne?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, that does finish my turn.
-MATT-
All right, Orym.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
Top of your turn, because you were inside its mouth.
-ROBBIE-
Oh no!
-MATT-
The teeth chew into you.
-LAURA-
Mm!
-MATT-
You take 19 points of piercing damage.
-LAURA-
No.
-MATT-
And you're a fighter, you're fine.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-TRAVIS-
"You're a fighter, you're fine."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Do I do anything?
-LAURA-
He's going to--
-MATT-
You feel like it's trying to siphon something from you that isn't present.
-LIAM-
I don't got it.
-LAURA-
Oh! Oh!
-ROBBIE-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Oh, it's sucking magic!
-MARISHA-
Magic? It wants to...
-LAURA-
Because it's Aeor!
-MARISHA-
Suckle magic?
-MATT-
What do you want to do?
-TALIESIN-
It's a magic sucker.
-MATT-
So Orym is caught in this gigantic toothy maw in its gut, and tries a couple times with his small frame to pry it apart but can't, he's just not strong enough.
So suddenly, Dorian, you see a cloud of blue and green and black and Orym appears just above the thing and lands on its arm and starts running "Shadow of the Colossus" style up its arm, slashing as he goes.
That was Misty Step.
That's a 20, that's a 30 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
That hits.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, it can--
-LIAM-
That is 11 points of damage.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
20 to hit?
-MATT-
20 hits.
-LIAM-
20 to hit. Okay.
That is just seven points of damage.
Now we'll make this a goading attack.
That's cocked.
-MATT-
I'm leaving the original Flaming Sphere damage, by the way, because I should have mentioned something back then.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Okay.
-LIAM-
Okay.
So this third attack is a goading attack.
It is eight plus-- It is 14 points of damage.
He has to make a wisdom save.
Slashing up the arm, that third one slashes across its head, its skull.
-MATT-
15?
-LIAM-
No, it's higher now.
It's 18 at this point.
-MATT-
Yeah.
So you go carving, as you run up its body, up its arm, carved through its face and now one of the jowls (slurps) leaves hanging there.
Where it was, it pulls back, you can see there's a skull beneath it.
There's no face, but there is a skull behind it.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
Where you can see a eye socket and teeth.
-TALIESIN-
A lot of good it's doing.
-LIAM-
Springs up off of its back, action surge, slash it on the head as I flip to its other shoulder.
This is also a goading attack.
That is 20 to hit, which hit before.
Or no, this is a pushing attack.
Excuse me.
Four plus is 10.
15 points of damage.
Has to make a strength save, beat 18.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 23.
-LIAM-
23.
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Is there any blood and viscera that comes out when that hits?
-MATT-
No.
It's like cutting through a bloodlet pig for me.
It's like cutting through a bloodlet pig for me.
Like a post-butcher or a--
-TRAVIS-
Exsanguinated.
-MATT-
Yeah.
A body without blood.
-TRAVIS-
Got ya.
-LIAM-
So, 20 to hit on the fifth, and that is a 10 of damage.
Has to make another strength save for a trip attack.
Excuse me.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 21.
-LIAM-
Saves.
The last one, I jam it right directly in now.
That's a 21 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits.
-LIAM-
Another tripping attack.
Four.
This is 10.
17 points of damage.
One last strength save to beat an 18.
-MATT-
How do you want to do this? (oohing)
-LIAM-
It is full "Shadow of the Colossus" running up its arm.
Slashing the arm, slashing the arm, cross the head, flips over, slashing again, gets one last slash and it goes to stab and it sinks through the thick, almost fish-like hide, (thunk), all the way up to the hilt.
I pull it out and feel it. Uh-oh, okay.
What? I ride it down to the ground and then skip off, down onto the ground.
-MARISHA-
Let's go! (applauding)
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Chetney comes around with his harp.
(strum) (laughter)
-LAURA-
Prestidigitation applause.
-TALIESIN-
I cast a tiny bit of Slow on you.
-LIAM-
A little bit of Slow?
-TALIESIN-
Just to have that, like--
-LIAM-
Just for funsies? Just to calm me down?
-TALIESIN-
Speed is halved, so you have that little like, ooh.
-LIAM-
Thanks.
-TALIESIN-
Take a moment.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Take it twice.
-TRAVIS-
After the echo of the giant creature falling over settles--
-MATT-
Dust. (whoosh)
-TRAVIS-
Any sound of anything moving, activating the--
-MATT-
Make a perception check for me using your hearing.
-LAURA-
Do you have something like Control Flame?
-MARISHA-
Because that felt too easy.
It feels like this can't over.
-LAURA-
Can you put the fire out on the--
-TRAVIS-
18.
-MATT-
18.
As the silence falls over, as you all take a breath, you can hear movement in the far distance.
You did make massive explosions and lightning blasts and screeches, and that echoed quite loudly through this cavern.
So, to no surprise, you do hear far away the sound of rocks like, (tiny impacts) (glurping growl)
-TRAVIS-
You know what we could do? We could run up in this tower and see what comes so we can see what's around here.
-ASHLEY-
Yes. So I'm--
-MATT-
The tent is on fire, too.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to Control Flames.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
And put out the fire in the tent.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to bust out the-- Do you think that hammer will fit in the hole?
-TRAVIS-
That thing is fucking-- How big is it? 10 feet? 15?
-TALIESIN-
15.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
But it's also deep.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, who would wield it?
-MATT-
I will say, the flames are wider than a five-foot cube.
-TALIESIN-
It's crazy Aeor tech, man.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
Ask him.
-TALIESIN-
Can the hammer fit in the hole, in theory?
-MATT-
The hammer fit in?
-TALIESIN-
If I opened up the-- monsters hammer, if I opened up the portable hole.
-LIAM-
Portable hole.
-MATT-
No, it's about a good 15 to 20 feet long.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, fine.
-LAURA-
If I'm also controlling flames, can I help?
-MATT-
You can put it in and it's sticking out the edge.
-LAURA-
If I'm also using Control Flames, could I help put it out?
-MATT-
I think if you have it at your disposal as well, then yeah.
The two of you together would be able-- It's about, sorry, 10 feet, and it's starting to climb quickly.
So both of you can take a side and together reduce the fire.
-TRAVIS-
I meant to do this last time, but can I run into the burning tent and on a spare piece of wood, can I start to carve in the symbol that's on the guy's chest, just in case we need to remember it visually?
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
If anyone wants to help, I'm going to drag this fucking body into that tent as quickly as possible, make it a little harder--
-LAURA-
That giant thing?
-TALIESIN-
I'm strong.
-ASHLEY-
I'll try to help.
I'll try to help.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-ASHLEY-
I'll try to help because I want some teethies from the tummy.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
Just quickly, drag it for a little cover.
-MATT-
Okay. Go and roll a strength check for me.
With advantage because you're helping.
-TALIESIN-
Okay. I was also going to say, technically, I think I still have a tiny bit of--
-MATT-
Rage left, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's just a strength check.
21.
-MATT-
21.
It's not budging.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
21? Wow.
-MATT-
This this thing together weighs probably close to 1200 to 1500 pounds.
It would weigh more if it wasn't so thin.
So, even the two of you pulling it, dragging it, and moves an inch.
-ASHLEY-
Can I give him a quick looksy and see if there's anything on him?
-LAURA-
Yeah, look at his teeth.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Lift up his skin on his skull.
-MATT-
Okay.
If you want to go ahead and inspect as you hear the sounds of things in the distance coming closer at whatever pace they are.
-LIAM-
Tower.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, let's go to the tower.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I like the tower idea.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
But you check, you can see where the face was cut through and the jowl that's there, there is a humanoid skull in there.
Even though the skin is stretched over it, smooth in a way that it doesn't utilize eye sockets or a mouth.
In fact, looking at some of the musculature, and it's humanoid, it's just stretched larger.
Make an arcana or nature check.
-LAURA-
You're looking at it, too, or is it just me?
-TRAVIS-
Augmentation on things.
-LAURA-
I think you should do it--
-TALIESIN-
You know who I'm thinking about right now.
-LAURA-
I don't.
I have investigation, which is what I was hoping for, but I shit on the others.
-TALIESIN-
This is giving me some serious Ira vibes and a little hint of Cyberman.
-MATT-
All right.
You don't know.
This isn't your specialty.
-LAURA-
It's just a-- It's like a skull.
-ASHLEY-
It's really scary.
-LAURA-
We should go.
-MATT-
It's spooky.
-TRAVIS-
We go up the tower.
-ROBBIE-
But we've got a minute while we've been investigating all of this?
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
While everybody's investigating this, Dorian's just so stoked from all the action that's just happened.
He's recapping it for everybody.
It was like: And my favorite part was when you did this.
And talking about how good everyone did.
While we're doing that, I'll cast a Motivational Speech.
(oohing)
-MARISHA-
What does that do?
-LAURA-
What does that do?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
What's my dicey level? Three or under or three or over? For when--
-MATT-
Oh, three or higher.
-ROBBIE-
Three or-- Oh no! Is it worth-- I said it out loud?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Well, I might as well do it at a four then.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Everybody gets 10 health back.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-ASHLEY-
Ooh!
-ROBBIE-
Everybody that can hear it.
-LIAM-
Oh, wow.
-ROBBIE-
Takes about a minute.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-ROBBIE-
He blathers on in the background for a minute.
-MATT-
Well, you gain, it's five temporary hit points.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-ROBBIE-
Wait.
-MATT-
One second.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I was doing it at 4th-level.
Yeah, three, right.
-MATT-
Oh, I see. Yeah.
So fourth level would be 10 temporary hit points.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Temporary.
-MATT-
Well, first-- Well, first.
-ROBBIE-
Wait, did I mess that up?
-MATT-
No, no, no.
No, no.
-MARISHA-
Uh-oh.
-ROBBIE-
I could easily have messed it up.
-MATT-
Yeah, just five creatures that are in range that can hear you.
-LAURA-
Oh, five creatures.
-ROBBIE-
Five, I'm sorry.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
I messed it all up.
-MATT-
That's all right. No, you didn't mess it all up.
Just one little thing there.
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Who hasn't taken damage?
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
I'm pretty good.
-LAURA-
Really?
-TALIESIN-
I could definitely use it.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I'm okay. Because I can get temporary health points.
-ROBBIE-
A lot of us got dinged, right?
-TALIESIN-
I got dinged.
-LAURA-
Yeah, we all did.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Do that side.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
Anyone who's hurting, including myself, if I can fit it in.
Well, all four of us.
-TRAVIS-
We're good.
We played that smart.
-ASHLEY-
And that's temp?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
You know?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Unlike y'all.
-ASHLEY-
10 temporary.
-ROBBIE-
For an hour.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to go--
-MATT-
Temporary hit points.
-ROBBIE-
We're still running from potential danger, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah, potentially.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Does that pull up our hit point count 10 in addition to the ceiling being higher, or is it just a higher ceiling?
-LAURA-
It's just a temporary.
So those would hit those 10 first.
-LIAM-
The ceiling higher.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You still have the damage you have, but the 10 go first.
While you have those temporary hit points, you also have advantage on wisdom saving throws.
-LAURA-
Great.
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-MATT-
But as soon as those temporary hit points go away, so does that effect.
-MARISHA-
Because remember, there's probably some sort of demon thingy fucking with people's heads and making them turn on people.
-ASHLEY-
Then when you did a lightning and then when Imogen did a lightning, it was so cool at the same time.
-ROBBIE-
Did it together.
-MATT-
(ominous croak)
-LAURA-
We got to go.
We gotta go.
-LAURA-
Up the tower?
-LIAM-
Yeah, we're making for that tower.
-MATT-
All right. You all clamber up inside the tower.
I'd like you to make a group stealth check.
-ASHLEY-
Pass Without a Trace!
-TALIESIN-
Are you doing it? You're doing Pass?
-MARISHA-
It's great.
-ASHLEY-
It's up to you.
-TALIESIN-
I'll take this pass because it doesn't cost me anything.
-TRAVIS-
As we're going up the tower, any kind of crates--
-MATT-
Have you already used Pass Without Trace?
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
Yes, I have. Never mind.
-LAURA-
Okay, so you're doing it.
-ASHLEY-
I feel like I've used it, too.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, you've used a few spell slots, but he can only use it once per day.
-TALIESIN-
I only use it once per day.
-ASHLEY-
Got it. I'm going to do it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Also, I need you to roll a d20 for me, please.
-ROBBIE-
Oh fuck.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Please nuke us.
-ROBBIE-
11.
-MATT-
11, you're fine.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
As we're going--
-MATT-
Essek gathers up with the rest of you and goes like, "First off, my apologies, but it seemed like it was the most effective thing to do at the time.
Calculations and all of that.
Secondly--"
-ASHLEY-
(perturbed) It's fine.
-LIAM-
See a lot of those down here?
-MATT-
"That is only the second time I've seen one of those and the first time I've fought one.
Part of the game is to not be discovered.
Speaking of which, we should go.
Are you all--"
-LAURA-
Essek, can we hide in one of these towers?
-MATT-
"We can certainly try," and he glides over in that direction to gather up with the rest of you.
What were you were saying?
-TRAVIS-
Is there any crates or anything to inspect at the bottom of the tower or the stairs as we work our way up to peek over the edge?
-MATT-
Sure, yeah.
As you glance around, make a perception check for me.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
Werthers! Fuck you! Seven.
-MATT-
Seven.
It looks like most anything of interest has probably already been picked clean from here.
Especially with the proximity of the Vanguard, they probably slowly worked throughout this portion of the city.
So, anything that would've been interest has already been pulled.
You can see areas, the floor, where it's much cleaner than others and where things have been moved out.
But you all gather up to the top.
The group stealth check with Pass Without a Trace.
I'll include Essek in this as well.
-TALIESIN-
Forgot to do myself.
-MATT-
It's going to be 16 for Essek.
-TALIESIN-
With no Pass Without?
-MATT-
He rolled real bad.
-LAURA-
No, not Essek.
-TALIESIN-
No Pass Without Trace, or with Pass?
-MATT-
With Pass.
-TRAVIS-
With Pass.
-LAURA-
With Pass.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yeah. 38.
-MATT-
38.
-ASHLEY-
Damn.
-TALIESIN-
Nat 20.
-TRAVIS-
Boom.
-LAURA-
28.
-MATT-
Nat 20. Tell me if it's nat 20, because that's actually worth two victories.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, nat 20.
-MATT-
What'd you get again? Sorry.
-LAURA-
28.
-MATT-
28.
-ASHLEY-
23.
-MATT-
23.
-ROBBIE-
23.
-MATT-
Great.
-MARISHA-
36.
-MATT-
Great.
-TRAVIS-
(belches) 35.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh.
-MARISHA-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
We're real quiet.
-MATT-
As you all clamor up in the tower and hold down as quiet as you can, obscuring yourself here in the shaded space of this stone tower.
As you all get in there, too, there are parts of the floor that shift under your feet and bits of stone floor fall out from the ruin.
You worry for a brief moment, this tower is maybe not as sound as you thought it would be, but not to the point where it feels like it's about to collapse yet.
You all slowly sit there and as you wait--
-LIAM-
Perimeter.
Orym's going to listen.
-TRAVIS-
Eyes just above the edge.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Perception check.
-LIAM-
That is a 28.
-MATT-
28.
Looking past, the first thing you see--
-LIAM-
30, excuse me.
-MATT-
You see this small pack of three hound-like creatures.
They're leaping over rocks and clamoring and circling around.
It's hard to make out much detail beyond they are quadrupedal and have these large tails, as they step into the nearby bits of the very, very subtle light-- Actually, you don't have your light source currently lit, right? There's the low inner lantern on the inside of the tent. So you see the shadow as they begin to approach and sniff around the tent.
You look at one, and they are much larger than a standard dog, right? Even compared to just a wolf, but there's no fur.
It is an odd somewhat turquoise gray coloration, It is an odd somewhat turquoise gray coloration, like a blubber or a dolphin-like exterior, but with a wolf-like snout, eyes, ears, just furless.
You see on the back of its tail, as it looks in there, the end of this long striated muscular tail, a large eyeball is fixed that is also looking separately within the tent behind it.
-LAURA-
Didn't we attack this before?
-MATT-
They like, (snarls).
One of them lumbers inside and you hear, (growls) and it drags out one of the murdered bodies, and two of them jump on it and start eating it, while the third one drags off on the other side and pulls another body out.
They're just feeding on the remains of the murder scene at the moment.
-LAURA-
Guess it's good you copied that symbol.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Matt, do these look or feel related at all to the doggos on the moon? What are those called? I'm trying to-- To the doggo-like creatures.
-MATT-
Oh, I know what you're talking about. Yeah.
No.
I mean, other than looking very strange--
-MARISHA-
Avadons, right?
-MATT-
Yeah.
Other than looking very strange in their quadrupedal form, these have heads.
There's very little beyond the fact that they are canine-like, but you don't see much else that really connects the tissue.
-MARISHA-
Then jumping off of that, this monster baddie that we fought, does it feel related at all to the type of genetic modification that they've been doing on the moon? Has Ludinus been taking some of inspiration from here to help them or it seems like two totally different things?
-LAURA-
I feel like they were doing different things.
-TALIESIN-
Can I jump on that one?
-MATT-
Make an intelligence check for me.
-MARISHA-
I'm looking at my little alien fetus in the jar.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go, INT, let's go.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that would be my question, is does it remind us of Ira's experience?
-TRAVIS-
Plus two, plus two.
-MARISHA-
11.
-MATT-
11.
It's hard to see if there is any connection tissue here.
This is also an ancient ruin.
You're not sure the source of this creature.
It could be. Could not be.
It's rough to pinpoint it.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Orym limps over to the other side of the tower as part of the--
-ASHLEY-
(sneezes)
-ROBBIE-
Bless you.
-LIAM-
30 perception. I know we're close.
I don't know how close to the lip of the crater, the hole.
Can we, from this height, see over the edge of it, or is it much higher up?
-MATT-
So, you can, at that height, can just barely see over the lip.
It's maybe about a couple hundred feet, a few hundred feet from where you are right now.
You're not up against it immediately, but you're not terribly far, either.
So from where your height is, everyone else is looking down at this feeding frenzy and the sounds of other calls and other creatures, you do also hear something else (grunting) down the way.
The three dog creatures look over, one of them goes back to eating quickly, while the other two tear the body in half that they're currently feeding on, pick it up in their mouths, and start leaping off to escape the ruin.
You're looking past the other direction.
You can see just past this part of the cavern where it's pitch black, there is the faintest bit of light now that you've really adjusted to the darkness of the interior here.
There's a part of this cavern roof that the faintest bit of sunlight is coming through.
You look over and it's looking up in that direction.
It's not that there's an opening, it's that part of the ceiling here is just solid glacier ice.
It's thick enough where most of the light is obscured entirely, but just the faintest bit of light's coming through.
-LIAM-
All ice, or--
-MATT-
Most of it's rock, but this one area ahead of you is just the faintest.
-LAURA-
That could be an exit, potentially?
-LIAM-
On our sides still occasional little baubles of blue for the people in stasis or whatever.
-MATT-
Oh, as you look around, the entire city is peppered with them.
-LIAM-
Right.
-MATT-
There's the three you see in this battle map and there are hundreds that surround you all around.
-LIAM-
Do they provide dim light? That's what's happening.
-MATT-
Very dim light.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
But yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Tryptophobia for satellites.
-MATT-
Essek, sitting off in the shadow goes, "Well, we survived that.
Where we're going, I am not entirely certain what awaits us.
Do we need to take a moment to prepare ourselves? If it gets too hairy down there, I can likely find a quick way to abscond from this.
Especially if you have the ability to get us to move through the air rather rapidly.
It would be safer than climbing down, regardless, but if we can afford us a bit of rest, that might be good."
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I hurt, so I'm definitely down for some rest.
-LIAM-
I hurt, I hurt.
I can go, but if we go, I'm going to need a little help.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-LIAM-
Unless we take a beat.
-LAURA-
All right.
Sure, we can take a rest.
-TALIESIN-
What the fuck even hit me?
-MARISHA-
Taking a short rest? Is that what we're doing?
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-LAURA-
A short rest, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's what hit me?
-LAURA-
Are we good where we are to take a rest right here?
-MATT-
"Where else would we take it?"
-TRAVIS-
As long as the tower doesn't collapse.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
(darkly) The tower doesn't collapse.
-TALIESIN-
Damn.
-LIAM-
Before we rest--
-TALIESIN-
I'm usually on the other end of that--
-ASHLEY-
Are we doing a short rest?
-TALIESIN-
-- weird gravity shift.
That felt-- (uncomfortable shudder)
-MATT-
"Yes, my curiosity about your strange affliction continues to deepen.
I would like very much when this is over to perhaps-- Experiment's the wrong word."
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MATT-
"I would like to look into you."
-TALIESIN-
I would appreciate that. I'm-- I've got too many I don't knows these days.
Trying to get rid of a few.
-MATT-
"Same."
-TALIESIN-
(laughs) I like him. He's hot.
-TRAVIS-
Short rest.
-MATT-
So as you're taking your short rest as well--
-TALIESIN-
Oh thank god.
-MATT-
-- you can see where those creatures rushed off.
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you're good.
-MATT-
A number of other lumbering beasts come in.
You see two massive gorilla-type creatures that come through.
Not straight to this tent room, but around the thing.
They're almost hunting or pursuing the sounds that came through.
You see flashes that have a greenish tint to them.
Also hairless, somewhat weird, almost like a damp blubber-like exterior as they leap--
-LAURA-
Gross.
-MATT-
-- from rock face to rock face, both of them hunting in tandem as they go through.
-LAURA-
Can I ask, the dogs and these gorilla things, what is their reaction, if anything, to the giant tummy teeth beast?
-MATT-
The dogs sniffed around it.
-LAURA-
Didn't really have a--
-MATT-
But didn't really care much.
They were more interested in what smelled delicious.
-LAURA-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
Then these gorilla beasts, they don't even pay it any mind.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Also, if we take a short rest, we lose the temporary hit points and the wisdom advantage, right? Because that was an hour.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
You do.
-TALIESIN-
Damn!
-MATT-
So, your call.
-ROBBIE-
Only an hour.
-LAURA-
But then you could cast it again.
-ROBBIE-
And you get real hit points.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
Do you get any-- With your class, do you get any spells back when you rest?
-ROBBIE-
That's a good question.
-MATT-
I don't think so. Only wizards as part of their--
-ROBBIE-
Mm-mm.
-MATT-
-- Arcane Rest ability and then their sorcery points.
-LAURA-
Right.
-MATT-
Bards, they get a bunch of other cool shit.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Bards.
-MATT-
All right, so--
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah, I still have some good shit.
-MATT-
Still rolling some hit dice over here.
-LAURA-
Which is what I'm doing.
I'm am gaining back my 5th-level spell that I used and then I'm going to use the vial of Laudna's blood to regain those sorcery points.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I get my fucking-- I get my chaos burst back.
-LIAM-
Orym's a little achy still.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Looking a little tired, even after the short rest.
We short rested--
-ROBBIE-
Oh, it does it for me.
-LAURA-
I didn't-- Fuck off!
-LIAM-
-- during this day already.
-MATT-
As you're getting close to the end of your short rest, another one of those dog creatures with the eye tail, looks like a scrawnier one that's on its own seems to follow up over in the area as well, sniffing around and slowly begins to look nervously around and skitters down to where body of the creature is.
Sniffs your massive kill, goes back into the tent, pulls another body out by a leg.
As it begins to gnaw on its foot, Essek goes, "Watch," and points above you.
You see ever so faintly, only because he points it out, this single strand of what looks like a thread of silver or something just descends.
It heads straight down.
-TRAVIS-
That's pretty.
-MATT-
With your perception, it's not a thread.
It's an impossibly long piece of goo.
It reaches down and just touches the top of the wolf creature and then (snatch) pulls it up and you hear. (yelps)
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(gawks)
-MATT-
Up into the shadow, you don't even see the source of it, you just hear: (slobbery gnashing)
-ASHLEY-
Oh! Oh. Okay.
-LAURA-
That was from the ceiling? That was from the ceiling?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, what--
-MATT-
Pieces of it begin to fall down.
-LIAM-
So everyone saw a thread come down, I know that it was snot, and it got yanked.
-ASHLEY-
A spider of some sort?
-MATT-
Yeah. The rest--
-TRAVIS-
The ceiling's more than 60 feet up from the tower, right?
-MATT-
Yes. Yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You get the sense here, and Essek looks to the rest of you.
"So yeah, there are many strange, unnatural things that call this place home.
Some that were from Aeor, others that have just found it home or been changed by the odd magics here.
But we should be focusing on moving quietly--"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
"-- and unseen."
-TALIESIN-
We might want to wear a hat.
-LAURA-
Did any of the creatures seem to be attracted to the lamp light coming from the tents?
-MATT-
"I'm certain it--" Are you asking me or asking him?
-LAURA-
I was asking you, Matt.
-MATT-
Oh, yeah.
You were still in the accent so I wasn't sure.
-LAURA-
Sorry, I was kind of-- Yeah, you're right.
-TRAVIS-
Imogen's just talking real loud.
-MATT-
They were following the sound, and when they saw the light they then went to inspect what that is, yeah.
-LAURA-
Went to the light? Okay, okay.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Barbara Ann.
-TRAVIS-
(Texblade) We should get moving.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Oh, Fjord, what's up?
-LIAM-
What's that, Captain?
-TRAVIS-
Hmm? What?
-MATT-
A little Tusktooth squeaking through in here.
-TRAVIS-
(clears throat)
-ROBBIE-
Was that Chet's real voice all along?
-MATT-
I know. (laughs) Big reveal!
-TRAVIS-
(nervous moan) Fuck, I've been made!
-LIAM-
You've just been Shapechanged Fjord all this time?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Amazing.
-MARISHA-
It's almost like we're--
-TALIESIN-
Yippee ki-yay.
-MARISHA-
-- three campaigns at once.
-TRAVIS-
See Invisibility.
-MATT-
All right. So that being the case, Pass Without a Trace has also, as the short rest, lost its--
-LAURA-
Fuck.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
So if you want to spend another.
-LAURA-
Oh, and we lost our temps.
-ROBBIE-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Unless you want to cast it again, your call.
-ASHLEY-
I will cast it again.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
So new stealth.
-MATT-
So everyone gets Pass Without a Trace for the next hour as well, restealth.
-LAURA-
Restealth.
-MATT-
Also roll another d10.
Or sorry, d20.
-ASHLEY-
Me? Okay.
I didn't for the last time I did Pass Without a Trace.
-MATT-
That's right, so roll twice.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Didn't you? You rolled a one.
-MATT-
Because it's fun.
I thought you rolled the--
-LAURA-
It was an 11.
-ASHLEY-
But didn't I roll that for stealth?
-LAURA-
Oh, was that for stealth?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that was for stealth.
-LAURA-
Okay, my bad.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Five.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so second time.
-MATT-
And now for this time.
-ASHLEY-
Three.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
Phew.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Finally, our normal rolling is paying off.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
I want Dorian to get hit with wild magic and turn blue.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Ha-ha!
-TALIESIN-
It's the wrong blue! Oh god!
-LAURA-
I did turn blue for a little bit.
-TALIESIN-
I'm not navy!
-ROBBIE-
You did, really? You turned blue?
-LAURA-
I turned blue and I lost all my hair.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) Yay!
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-LAURA-
I did.
-MARISHA-
You were seafoam.
-TALIESIN-
I wouldn't laugh.
-ROBBIE-
The things you miss.
-MATT-
Hey, more opportunity.
Just keep casting your spells, friends.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah! All of my--
-LIAM-
She started Blue Man Group in Exandria.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Dibs on front row.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
So--
-ROBBIE-
Splash zone.
-MATT-
Essek goes, "If you have the capability, I would recommend us to try to circumvent climbing within that," and he gestures over to the massive pothole that the rest of you now turn around and notice, but Orym has seen before.
This incredible space, you saw it from a distance where the roads arced upward like something had punched through and they're locked in this almost volcanic force that burst through the middle of this city ward leaving this impossibly large sinkhole that you cannot see the other side of it, it's so big from here.
What little bit of light comes through the bit of ceiling ice sections that the little bit of filtered light that glows and the element orbs around it, you can see this endless expanse of darkness.
"So, I do not want to burn all of my important things."
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"But I can comfortably take four."
-LAURA-
Wow. Comfortably, you can take four.
I would be burning a lot to take four.
-MARISHA-
So you're saying we're going that way, but we can't touch anything?
-MATT-
"We can."
-LAURA-
I can--
-MATT-
"But climbing is a bit dangerous since I'm not entirely certain what the bottom is."
-LAURA-
Can you--
-ASHLEY-
I could--
-LAURA-
-- turn into something?
-ASHLEY-
I could turn into something and carry somebody.
-LIAM-
You've never seen the bottom?
-MATT-
"No.
I prefer to carefully explore, and each time met some sort of a barrier and discovered it was best to leave."
-LIAM-
How far down would you say you've gone?
-MATT-
"I mean, the farthest I've been is the ninth basement floor, and where we're heading, I believe, is in the seventh or eighth."
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I can comfortably take three, or, if Fearne--
-ASHLEY-
I could fly.
I can also, basically, if I think about it, I can pretend I'm a feather in my head and whoosh down.
Yeah, then you can't control, necessarily, where you're going.
-LIAM-
If you fly, you can take me--
-ASHLEY-
You want a ride?
-LIAM-
-- and Chet maybe, depending--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
-- on how big you want to get.
-ROBBIE-
I can help someone to fly as well, if you prefer.
-LAURA-
Oh, because you can fly.
-ROBBIE-
I can.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
You can carry somebody.
-LAURA-
Okay, well--
-ROBBIE-
I could.
Or I could play a little tune--
-ASHLEY-
You should carry Orym.
-ROBBIE-
-- and if someone wants to fly under their own power.
-LIAM-
Would Dorian be able to hold halfling frame without too much--
-MATT-
Yeah, slowly. It wouldn't be good for a chase, but for this circumstance you could probably--
-LAURA-
In that case--
-LIAM-
I'll piggyback.
-MATT-
It'd be half speed carrying you, so everyone, you'd be a little behind everybody.
-LAURA-
Then you don't need to-- Don't your druid, your Wild Shape because that's wasting it.
-ASHLEY-
I won't use it. Great.
-LAURA-
I'll do Fly on us three.
-ASHLEY-
Awesome.
-LAURA-
Then you can do you three.
Save a little bit.
-LIAM-
I'm going to piggyback on Dorian.
-LAURA-
They can do it, unless you want to use that higher--
-MATT-
"No, I will happily save that slot."
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
"Instead only burn a fifth."
-LAURA-
All right.
I'll burn a fifth as well.
-MATT-
"Very well."
-ROBBIE-
You're going to burn a fifth for it to do what? Make someone fly?
-LAURA-
To fly three people.
-MATT-
"Now--"
-LAURA-
Why?
-ROBBIE-
I could do it for pretty cheap.
-LAURA-
You can?
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-ROBBIE-
If you prefer.
-LAURA-
I mean, fuck.
-TRAVIS-
Cheaper's better.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Cheaper's better.
-ASHLEY-
Cheaper's better.
-ROBBIE-
Let me try this.
-LAURA-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
I'll play a little tune, and I've got my mandolin, and I can cast Fly.
It's still at 3rd-level, but I got a ton of slots for it, unused.
-LAURA-
Oh wow.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Sure, Give it a try? Who needs to fly?
-LAURA-
Wait, but it's concentration.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I can only do one, yeah.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah, so you have to do it at a higher level in order to get multiple targets.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, you're right.
-LAURA-
So, I'll still do the fifth.
Or I can do fourth and you can do fourth.
-TRAVIS-
Then you have to double roll for wild magic or just one fifth and one of you do wild magic?
-LAURA-
I'll just do--
-ROBBIE-
Would you rather double roll or want me to bear the burden? You feel lucky?
-LAURA-
Wait, you'll still have to do fourth to do--
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, I'm going to carry one.
-LAURA-
Oh, you can carry.
-ROBBIE-
Then cast--
-LAURA-
I'll just do fifth then and just do one roll.
-MATT-
"Very well.
So you're carrying this one."
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Then I'm bringing myself, you, you, and you."
-LAURA-
I'm doing Fearne, me, and--
-ASHLEY-
Thank you.
-LAURA-
-- Ashton.
-TRAVIS-
I have a name.
-LAURA-
So you're doing a--
-TALIESIN-
Cheers.
-MATT-
"All right, so 5th-level."
-TALIESIN-
You do?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"All right."
-TRAVIS-
Pretty ass mother fucker.
-LAURA-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
Chet's salty tonight.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Tonight?
-TRAVIS-
Did you see the size of that guy?
-MATT-
So with that--
-TALIESIN-
Pock O'Pie.
-MATT-
12.
-LAURA-
11.
-MATT-
All right, you're fine.
All of you feel the gravity dissipate and the weight of your body begin to vanish.
With a bit of mental push, most of you are able to fly.
You are being carried.
As you all begin to take off, it's a rapid flying speed of 60 feet, but only 30 for you while you're carrying Orym.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
So everyone stays at a slower 30-foot pace.
-LIAM-
Thanks, guys.
-TALIESIN-
I'm spotting, so.
-ROBBIE-
Shoulders or piggyback? Sometimes I've-- (laughs) (laughter)
-LIAM-
I think probably my feet are poking out under your armpits and my arms around your neck, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(fluttering)
-MATT-
Perfect. (whooshes)
-MARISHA-
Yoda.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You all--
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MATT-
-- coast up in the air, meeting the midway between the ceiling gap to the floor.
Right as you approach the edge at the lip of this massive, empty space, you begin to see the faint layers where bits of light flicker in and out throughout.
There are many, many subterranean floors beneath this city ward that are carved through like a layered cake that had the center of it pushed through.
You could see parts of it are blasted open.
It's not an even, perfect cylinder.
It looks like it was done violently, and there's bits of tangled, shredded metal and bits of stone that has cracked and collapsed.
Some look like they've fallen in on there and it's an inaccessible mess.
There are others that have what looks like floors, partial rooms that are exposed and accessible.
Many of the aqueducts that run through the city here that drain and fall, creating dozens of small waterfalls that all vanish into this pit below, some of them also partially flood some of these outcroppings you can see as the water drips in and fills up what's exposed.
Here, as you look over the space, Essek glances around.
"All right, stay close.
I'll see if I can recall the proper floors," and begins to descend into the open chasm as the rest of you follow suit, making--
-LIAM-
Orym is looking for spiders and whatever the fuck.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm. Perception check--
-ASHLEY-
Same.
-MATT-
-- for me, if you don't mind.
-TALIESIN-
All the ruined places.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Natural one.
I will reroll it.
Attaboy, that's a 32.
-TALIESIN-
Oof, yeah.
-MATT-
Now, you have disadvantage in here because of the lack of light.
-LIAM-
Okay, so it should be a straight roll?
-MATT-
Yeah. You're looking at a distance in very, very, very low light.
-LIAM-
Well, that's not as good.
That's a 16.
-MATT-
16, okay.
It's challenging to make out much at this distance.
As you slowly descend, you can see some of these openings.
Flashes of metal hallways.
You can see the occasional flicker of some sort of magic lantern or torch that shouldn't be burning under these circumstances that still alights far down a hallway, like there's just blackness and then one little flickering bead of light and then darkness beyond it that sends a shiver through your spine as you descend past it.
That's the first basement floor.
Moving down, you begin to see the aesthetic continuing with these metallic walls, but dangling heavy cables that pour out of areas.
They could be flexible shafts or some sort of distant containment cable that brought objects from one to the other or possibly part of an expanded aqueduct system, as some of them appear to be dangling open and there is liquid dripping from them slowly.
Past the second level.
The third floor you see is deeply damaged.
Much of the area is blackened.
The machinery around it is twisted and broken.
This place looks like the beginning of the real heavy damage is starting to come to bear.
With each little pass, Essek goes through going, "(sighs) They've certainly picked a lot of this clean." You can see, as some of you pass by, some of the shapes right as you go by and the lights that you see on some of these levels passing from below and up, you see the outer shadow of a skeleton leaning against a piece of rock before it vanishes from sight.
You recall that the number of ancient bodies that reside in these ruins go beyond the city streets, and they are sandwiched all throughout the unknown depths and they are sandwiched all throughout the unknown depths of this Genesis Ward.
-LAURA-
Are we seeing any more lanterns lit or fires lit?
-TRAVIS-
Light, sources of light?
-MATT-
You see lights sources you pass by.
Some of them look like they're magically set in lanterns that still remain glowing forever as the enchantment requires.
But there are other darkened bits where it looks like the enchantments have been snuffed or areas where some have been removed and individuals that may have been wandering through here and took them for their own use and wandered elsewhere.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
But every now and then you see faint little bits of glows here and there.
You go past to the fourth floor basement, fourth floor.
This area is almost completely collapsed.
There is one darkened area that looks open still, but there's no light.
As you pass by, it's hard not to see a half dozen pairs of eyes, yellowish, glowing that shift through the shadow.
One seems to look in your direction before you move past it.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Floors five--
-TRAVIS-
Can I use my nose?
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ROBBIE-
Smell it.
-TRAVIS-
Smell that ass.
(disgusted laughter)
-MARISHA-
Wow.
-TRAVIS-
18.
-MATT-
18?
-TRAVIS-
I'm a wolf, all right? Ass is my specialty.
(laughter)
-MATT-
You do definitely smell--
-LAURA-
Ass. (laughs) (laughter)
-MATT-
Just so much of it.
This is a massive asshole, actually, the entire--
-ASHLEY-
So much of it.
-MATT-
No. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Let's get in!
-MARISHA-
Oh my god. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god, we're in it.
-TALIESIN-
It's balmy.
-ROBBIE-
He said it, he said it.
-MATT-
Aeor's a person. (laughs)
-LIAM-
Wash your ass.
-ROBBIE-
It was a butthole all along.
-TRAVIS-
Suddenly, a gush of wind.
(booms) (laughter)
-MATT-
We destroyed it.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(booms) (laughter)
-MATT-
You smell sweat, but it's nothing you recognize.
It is alien to your life experience.
You also smell rust, you smell hard water, you smell rot, you smell a faintest bit of almost the sweet rotting of fruit.
It's a mishmash of different scents that shift as you head down, and the occasional bit of air pours through, almost there's sources of gentle wind within these stacks of these ruins.
You can't understand what would be bringing wind through here.
But as it blows through, fresh scents wash it away.
As you go past that gust, you pick up those scents once more.
It is throwing you off.
Every now and then, those of you who are attuned to the weave of magic and crafting it, you feel these tingles that move through you, like an odd little shimmer that goes through your body and makes you uncomfortable the concept of setting loose a powerful incantation in that presence.
-ASHLEY-
This place tickles.
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Most of these floors down here are not traversable.
They are entirely collapsed and shut off.
There is no visual perspective.
Even Essek looks over to one area, "That is a fresh collapse there.
I deign to think what had occurred there as of late.
It's been a few years since I've been here, so, (grunts) since the Empire took the place under its wing officially."
-TALIESIN-
What was that?
-MATT-
"Oh, series of various research floors.
Many of it's still locked.
Me and my partner were trying to map out as much as we could, but we weren't the only ones here.
There are many minds looking to this space.
There were those coming in here to take what was worth, what they could find.
There was Dynasty interests that were setting up outposts, one of which was there," and points to the seventh floor that is this ruined mass of stone and tangled metal, "But it seems that operations have been shut down."
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-MATT-
"I think," and you see as one floor comes up, there's a bit of a shelf outcropping, "This is the eighth floor.
This is as far down between this and elements of the ninth that I've been.
But you had mentioned the Occultus, what is it you called it?"
-LAURA-
The Ruby Vanguard?
-MATT-
"No, no, the word we got from Astrid."
-LAURA-
Oh, Dominox?
-TRAVIS-
Occultus Thalamus?
-LAURA-
No.
-MARISHA-
Occultus--
-LAURA-
Thalamus.
-MARISHA-
-- Thalamus.
-MATT-
I just wanted to make sure you guys had your notes still.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MATT-
"I've come across some references to a Thalamus on these two floors.
We'll start with the eighth, and if this does not guide us anywhere of particular interest, we'll try and go for the ninth.
Though that is a bit more precarious.
This eighth basement floor was, as far as I can tell, a lot of arcane experimentation.
But many of these places were sealed off.
By the time we had gotten here, we had expended much of our capabilities.
At the first sign of any sort of danger, we had to leave for self-preservation reasons.
So shall we begin?"
-LIAM-
Just out of curiosity, looking down past the eighth and the ninth, it's just ongoing wreckage, wreckage, wreckage, until visibility dies?
-MATT-
Just floors are collapsed in, and you can see an area where the floors are blown out further, like it opens up into even further darkness.
-LAURA-
Do you know how deep it goes?
-MATT-
"I have not been to the bottom, but," and he takes a coin from the inside of his robe and throws it.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-MATT-
And it goes.
(whooshes)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
And just disappears.
You have a very high perception.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah.
-MATT-
Roll a perception for me.
-LAURA-
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
-LIAM-
27.
-MATT-
27.
It takes about 25, 30 seconds before you hear the faint-- (plopping)
-LAURA-
25, 30?
-MATT-
-- breaking the surface of water.
-LIAM-
It's very far.
-TRAVIS-
Water.
-LIAM-
Water?
-TRAVIS-
Water, all the way--
-LAURA-
Don't y'all just want to dive on down?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Ooh, sounds fun.
-TRAVIS-
I mean--
-MATT-
"What could possibly be down there?"
-TRAVIS-
This a safe point, 100%.
-LAURA-
No, I mean, yeah, no, no, it would be terrible, but--
-TALIESIN-
Probably the bodies of a bunch of other people who thought that this was a good idea.
-LAURA-
I mean, just Lara Croft it off, one second.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Just dive it off, yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"Be my guest."
-TRAVIS-
With a handstand first.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MATT-
"I'm going to go on the eighth floor," and he (whooshes) glides over on the edge of that--
-LIAM-
It must run off somewhere because it's been pouring here for who knows how long.
What better-- hold on!
-MARISHA-
It's strange, though--
-TALIESIN-
Magic water is magic water, as we definitely learned recently, it can come from anywhere and go to anywhere.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
You know what that just reminded me of?
-TRAVIS-
What?
-MARISHA-
When we lost FCG's coin in the tunnels of Jrusar.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Oh yeah.
-MARISHA-
It's strange being here without them.
-LAURA-
I wonder if they would've, I don't know, remembered anything?
-ASHLEY-
Felt something?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
You know, when we finish this, and we have infinite free time, we should go back and find that coin.
-LAURA-
We should.
-LIAM-
It feels needlessly cruel that they're not here right now.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Like most cruelty is needless?
-LAURA-
Hmm.
-MATT-
"That what makes it cruelty, isn't it?"
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah.
Well fucking put.
-LIAM-
Sorry, Letters.
-MATT-
"Well, let us begin," and he flies down, not quite touching ground.
Here this outcropping, it's about maybe 15 feet at its full extent and it's only about 25, 30 feet at the edge before it pulls back into at a lip and another broken wall ends on one side and the other plummets off into darkness into the side.
But here, as you all step down, the first thing you notice, there is a massive fallen stone ceiling that has crumbled in, part of the upper floor that had fallen in and filled in that space.
There are bits of metal weaving through the wreckage in its own right.
You see a tangled web of hanging cables that hangs from the ceiling.
As you approach, they're lying there still, like these impossibly thick hairs of some sleeping creature that makes you feel the ominous sense of the shadows within.
But in the center of the wreckage, part of it has been cleared out, and you can see there is a braced archway, like a door to a hallway beyond that has been cleared and revealed.
At its base in your direction, looks like there are two tables, modernized tables, and some small bags of supplies, and not unlike the tent that you had seen before, the remains of a Vanguard encampment, but no sign of any person there.
As you take in the sight for a second, this dull, distant vibrating hum this dull, distant vibrating hum seems to (spooky exhale) from further in the darkness.
-TALIESIN-
What the fuck is up with that?
-MARISHA-
Is it continuous or does it sound like breathing?
-MATT-
No, just that one.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Just that one?
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Is it a breath, a tone?
-TRAVIS-
Super-low heart rate.
-TALIESIN-
The sound of something big vibrating?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, (laughs) yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know.
Fuck.
-LIAM-
In the setup that they've left behind before they were murdered, are there any little magical lanterns of any kind that could travel?
-MATT-
You want to step up to the table, and you see there is a set of oil lanterns, and you see there is a set of oil lanterns, two of which look like they're broken, one that looks like it's functional, but is empty.
In some of the supply crates nearby, there are some small oil vials.
You do also see, looks like heavy leather, cured leather rolled up, for probably travel notes, for someone who's trying to map things out, but map something that can weather the elements better than parchment or vellum can.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
You look at it?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, they're empty.
These are blanks for use.
It looks like this encampment was set up to be a waypoint for further progression.
-MARISHA-
Is there a--
-ROBBIE-
Go ahead.
-MARISHA-
I was just going to say, a thick layer of dust or anything? How--
-ROBBIE-
Yes, that was my question, does it look older than the other one?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, how unused?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
One of you can make an investigation check with advantage if you'd like.
-MARISHA-
I will--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, because you're doing it together.
-MARISHA-
-- or you're probably better.
-ROBBIE-
Mm, I'm not great.
-MARISHA-
You're better than me.
-LAURA-
Are there any drops of blood around?
-MARISHA-
I'll assist you.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
So you have to roll twice--
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
-- take the highest, you get advantage.
-ROBBIE-
Not great.
Even worse.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Sorry, 10.
-MATT-
10.
I mean--
-MARISHA-
It's low, but it's not awful. You know?
-ROBBIE-
We're pretty, though.
(laughs)
-MATT-
-- they don't look as wrecked as the surroundings.
There's not a lot of dust here beyond what was created probably in its destruction and anything that wanders by.
You don't see any heavy layer.
That's the best you can make out.
-ROBBIE-
Did we all hear (laughs) that breath?
-MATT-
Oh, you felt that?
-ROBBIE-
We felt it?
-LAURA-
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Is there blood on anything? Drops o' blood?
-MATT-
Do you want to create a little bit of light to try and take out more than just the shape of things around you?
-LAURA-
Is our flying done?
-MATT-
I mean, you're now on the platform and there's a hallway before it.
-LIAM-
Save it, we can light up when--
-LAURA-
Yeah, I mean, it's only 10 minutes long.
-LIAM-
I'll go about lighting one of these--
-LAURA-
Oh, okay.
-LIAM-
-- oil lanterns.
-MATT-
Okay, so you refill the oil, (sparks) spark it, (whooshes) the lantern wick lights, and you turn it up as it does, and it alights.
You can see the shape of the rubble around you.
You do see one sign of a darker liquid.
It's not a splatter, it's a streak that leads into the dark tunnel ahead.
-LAURA-
Chet, does that smell like people?
-TRAVIS-
(sniffs)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Are you going to smell it or you just?
-LAURA-
Mm.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, there we go.
-TRAVIS-
(whooshes) (screams) (laughter)
Can I make a sniff above the streak, not touching it?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Sniff check.
-TALIESIN-
I dare you.
-TRAVIS-
Eight.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Oh no.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I mean, you have advantage on this because you're a wolf--
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MATT-
-- this is the thing you're good at.
-TRAVIS-
There we go, 19.
-MATT-
That's better.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Definitely humanoid blood.
It's not fresh, meaning it's not within the past few hours or so.
-TRAVIS-
It's a streak, it's not a smear?
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
I mean, no, it's a smear.
-ASHLEY-
A drag?
-TRAVIS-
Got it.
-LAURA-
Smear.
-MATT-
It's a faint bit that you see smearing and then dragged across some of the ruin and into the hallway beyond.
-TRAVIS-
Are there also any footprints or tracks of any kind accompanying either side of that smear, like something was pulling it backwards?
-MATT-
No.
-TRAVIS-
They float and bleed down here.
-MATT-
(laughs) Well, you don't see any bloody footprints at least.
-TRAVIS-
No bloody footprints.
-MATT-
If you want to make an investigation or survival check to look for any sort of tracks around it, you can.
-TRAVIS-
I will do that.
26.
-MATT-
26.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-MATT-
Indeed, there are many, many footprints.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
There's been a lot of foot traffic through this hallway, both ways, and all about, and all around the encampment here.
This area has been a busy point in the Vanguard's advancement through these ruins.
-MARISHA-
And we're for sure going that way?
-TRAVIS-
This way.
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
I take out--
-LIAM-
Yeah, what are we hearing, Essek? Sorry.
-MARISHA-
I take out Pâté.
-MATT-
"Hey, what's the plan? Hey."
-LAURA-
Shh.
-MARISHA-
Shut up.
-ASHLEY-
Why do you have--
-MARISHA-
Why do you have to say things--
-ASHLEY-
-- to be so loud?
-MARISHA-
-- when immediately summoned?
-MATT-
"I didn't think I was being loud about it."
-LAURA-
Baby.
-TRAVIS-
That was a little harsh.
He's a good personality.
-MARISHA-
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-LAURA-
Maybe he's just so lonely when he's--
-TRAVIS-
We just need to be stealthy.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
I think she's just--
-MATT-
"I think I'm pretty good staying quiet most of the time."
-ASHLEY-
Shh, shh, shh.
-MARISHA-
You are, you are.
-MATT-
"Thank you."
-MARISHA-
I'm sorry, I'm under so much pressure.
I didn't mean to snap at you.
-TALIESIN-
Has Dorian met Pâté?
-MATT-
"Forgiven."
-MARISHA-
He has.
-ROBBIE-
We have.
-MARISHA-
Yes, yes, I think, yes.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, okay.
-ROBBIE-
Best of friends.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Hey."
-ROBBIE-
Hi.
-MATT-
The jaw (cracks).
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Oh, sweetie.
I adjust it back for him.
-MATT-
(cracks)
-MARISHA-
(sighs) There you go.
-TRAVIS-
Could've used that to our advantage.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) I need you to go invisible.
-MATT-
"Okay," (poofs) vanishes.
-LAURA-
Shush.
Why's he got to yell it?
-ROBBIE-
He goes invisible?
-MARISHA-
I can't, he's his own mouse.
-LAURA-
Pâté, really just try, inside voice, whisper.
-LIAM-
Yeah, quietly.
-MATT-
"Okay."
-TRAVIS-
No.
-LAURA-
Like this.
-TRAVIS-
Take it out.
-MATT-
"I mean, I'm pretty loud inside, too." (laughter)
"But I'll try to keep it low."
-MARISHA-
It's all right.
-MATT-
"You have to understand, I don't really have vocal chords."
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"It's just wind and bone making this--"
-TRAVIS-
All lungs. (laughs)
-MATT-
"-- so I got to push real hard to make anything work."
-LAURA-
Oh, buddy.
-TALIESIN-
I can't believe that this sound is just making me sad, let him talk.
-MARISHA-
I know, now I feel bad.
-TALIESIN-
Just making me sad.
-ASHLEY-
You don't have to push as hard.
-TALIESIN-
Now--
-MARISHA-
Remember, me and you can communicate telepathically.
-MATT-
You hear in your head, "Yeah, I know, do you want to do that instead?"
-MARISHA-
Starting now, yes.
-MATT-
"Okay."
-MARISHA-
All right, I'm going to need you to go into this tunnel.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-MARISHA-
Do a little lookie-loo.
It's real dark, but you can see, you can see with the darkness.
-MATT-
"I got you, no worries."
-MARISHA-
Let me know what you see.
-MATT-
"Cool!"
-MARISHA-
(whooshes)
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Glides into the shadow.
-TRAVIS-
(chomps)
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MATT-
In that stillness and darkness, you concentrate to experience what he sees beyond.
And we're going to go to break--
-ALL-
Oh.
-MATT-
-- because we're at that midpoint, and it's a good beat to jump into this next leg--
-ASHLEY-
Naur, naur, naur.
-MATT-
-- of the exploration.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Sounds great, sounds cool.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
I can't wait, I bet you there's cool stuff in there.
-LAURA-
I bet it's going to be so peaceful here.
-MATT-
It's going to be fine.
It's going to be great.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, a carnival, maybe.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
A parade or--
-MATT-
Great, Orym.
All right, we'll be back here in a few minutes.
(mysterious music) (peaceful music) (music builds) (adventurous music)
-MARISHA-
Did Grog fuck a nymph?
-DANI-
No, he answered that.
-LAURA-
He did. He didn't fuck her.
-MARISHA-
Wait he did?!
-LAURA-
Yeah he answered that.
-DANI-
Yeah, it was in the campaign wrapup.
-ROBBIE-
And that's what memories are all about.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Warlock's gonna warlock, baby.
-ROBBIE-
Your mom's kind of sketchy too, right?
-LAURA-
I don't know what you're talking about.
-MATT-
I regret everything!
-LAURA-
Are you secretly in love with me?
-MARISHA-
The answer is yes.
-DANI-
That's sapphic culture.
(tavern music)
-KIRBY-
And now, a message from your Critical Role lore keeper: Dani Carr.
-DANI-
We here at Critical Role know that life happens.
Sometimes your friend becomes a rampaging werewolf that you gotta calm down.
Sometimes your other friend needs help dealing with a dead lady in her head.
We get it.
And when life happens, we are not always able to watch four to five hours of Critical Role a week.
That's why our lore department has been working tirelessly to find a way to make it both easier and faster to consume Critical Role's main campaign without losing that rich and vibrant tapestry of story and lore the Critter community has come to love.
And after countless hours of hard work, we are happy to announce that we have found that way.
Introducing Critical Role Abridged.
Each episode of this lore keeper approved series has been carefully crafted by an incredibly devoted team to include everything you need to know to follow the Bells Hells stories all in about one hour.
We've even added new pieces of artwork, bringing characters, items, and moments to life thanks to the help of our amazing community of artists from around the world.
The time is now to begin your Critical Role catch up with abridged episodes of the Bells Hells campaign.
New episodes air every Tuesday at 10:00 AM Pacific on YouTube.
Beacon members receive two new episodes dropping every week on Tuesdays and Fridays.
(energetic music) (gentle music) Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop.
Roll an investigation if you want.
It's basically perfect.
It's so cute. I can't handle it.
(gasp) Could anything be more perfect? Look at this.
Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here.
This is a lot of stuff, you guys.
We have, like, so many cool things right now.
Oooh, so comfy cozy.
I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision.
Darling, I'd recommend buying two.
One for you. And another for you, let's be honest.
And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now.
(tavern music)

(ominous music) NARRATOR 1: Weepe and his Tripotentiary guard are walking up the main street, carrying a coffin.
NARRATOR 2: The blazing brightness of the Un beating down upon them.
NARRATOR 3: Weepe is shrouded and veiled and gloved against it, huddled under the shade of a somber and ornate parasol, leading the procession.
NARRATOR 1: A silent specter, a bandolier of quietly-pumping hoses and black vials encircling his body.
NARRATOR 3: Cue disembodied rabbit head tumbleweed.
NARRATOR 2: This is serious.
We're taking this seriously.
This is a somber moment.
A dead wind blows.
It just so happened that there was a disembodied rabbit head tumbleweed.
NARRATOR 3: Read the appendices if you're confused.
(epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music)
-TRAVIS-
Move the rook to B6.
-MARISHA-
Okay, see if that opens it.
-LAURA-
I'm trying it.
[clicks] (gasping) [metal clattering] (cheering)
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Wait, it's blank.
There's nothing in here.
What the hell?
-TALIESIN-
The phonograph said that the answer would be in the journal.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, maybe we missed something, like some clue we're not thinking of!
-LAURA-
Ah, we only have four minutes left!
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, think.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
The song said, "Look to the beacon." Look to the--
-MARISHA-
Right.
Beacon. Light.
-LAURA-
Get it out.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, uh!
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-TALIESIN-
The cryptics!
-TALIESIN-
The key is in the cryptics!
-LAURA-
So if every other letter--
-MARISHA-
Times two.
-LAURA-
-- is the combination--
-TRAVIS-
Did you say times? Times, like a clock.
It's in the clock! But how do you open it?
-LAURA-
(uncertain noise)
-MARISHA-
Okay. What is it?
-LAURA-
Okay, it's six.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Two. Four.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
624? It's 6:24!
-LAURA-
Uh. Zero.
[unlocking]
-MARISHA-
(gasp) LAURA and MARISHA: (excited noise)
-TALIESIN-
Guys, guys, I think I found it!
-TRAVIS-
But it's not opening!
-TALIESIN-
So how do you unlock this?
-MARISHA-
That's not the cryptics.
This is a cryptics.
-TALIESIN-
Wait, I think if I push my fingers into...
No, that's not working.
-MARISHA-
We just need the code word.
What's a six-letter code?
-TRAVIS-
I think it's jammed!
-LAURA-
Arlo said that in order to find the answer we need, we have to look to the beacon.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh. Right.
But Colonel Popcorn's telegram says--
-TRAVIS-
(grunts) [clattering]
-MARISHA-
"Be Aware -(STOP)- Exciting New -(STOP)- Amazing -(STOP)- Critical Role Content Available at Beacon.tv. -(STOP)- Oh my god.
No Idea How to Finish this Fake Telegram -(STOP)-"
-TRAVIS-
Reveal your secrets to me!
-TALIESIN-
Can either of you help me, help me with the--
-MARISHA-
That's not a cryptics!
-TALIESIN-
I am very aware.
(groans)
-LAURA-
Okay. What about this? Huh? Um, it says, "Try using Beacon." [shattering]
-TALIESIN-
Hey, Travis.
Could you help with the--
-TRAVIS-
Not now, dude, I'm trying to save us! We've only got 90 seconds left! [slamming]
(shrieks)
-LAURA-
"10% off merchandise.
Members-only Discord.
Exclusive new series." Is that a clue?
-MARISHA-
I don't know, it just feels too obvious, like something that a lazy writer would try and shoehorn into a script.
-TRAVIS-
(shrieks)
-LAURA-
Well, that would also explain this.
-MARISHA-
I know.
That's useless.
-LAURA-
Literally no one says "literally" anymore.
-MARISHA-
Exactly.
-TRAVIS-
We're running out of time, people! Come on!
-MARISHA-
Uh.
Okay, we just need a six-letter word that unlocks this artifact and also unlocks amazing content!
-LAURA-
Also, would it kill you to try to help us, Ashley?
-ASHLEY-
What do you think I'm doing? While you all are busy sucking eggs in La La Land, I was making an improvised munitions charge that'll blow this door off with minimal loss of life and hearing.
-LAURA-
You don't explode a door, Ashley! That's not how an escape room works!
-ASHLEY-
Oh, really? Because that is literally what this is, an escape room.
-LAURA-
She just said "literally."
-MARISHA-
"Literally."
-TRAVIS-
30 seconds!
-TALIESIN-
Help! It's again!
-ASHLEY-
Fire in the hole!
-KYLE-
Hey, guys.
Uh, good job or not, I guess.
Tried your best.
-LAURA-
Did we do it? Did we escape?
-KYLE-
No. No, no, you didn't.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, so close.
-MARISHA-
It was the stupid cryptics.
The code word was too hard.
-LAURA-
It was impossible!
-KYLE-
Was it?
-KYLE-
What was the name of the detective?
-LAURA-
Detective Beacon.
-KYLE-
Yeah, it was Beacon. Yeah? And where did the murder take place?
-MARISHA-
Beacon Street.
-KYLE-
Yeah, yeah.
And what was the name of the law firm that hired Detective Beacon to exonerate the Beacon State graduate from the murder on Beacon Street?
-MARISHA-
Beacon, Beacon, and Associates.
-LAURA-
And Associates.
-TRAVIS-
So what was the code word?
-KYLE-
It's Beacon! It's Beacon!
-KYLE-
Yep, see? Here's the room key and here is all the cool new info about Beacon, our new membership program that offers discounts, early access to the Critical Role podcast, and new content like "Critical Role Abridged" and "Re-Slayer's Take," along with exclusive content like "Fireside Chats," "The Crit Role Cooldown," and many more to come.
-TRAVIS-
So how do you get into the clock?
-KYLE-
You don't! That's just a clock!
-TALIESIN-
Kyle.
-KYLE-
What...
-TALIESIN-
I have a problem.
-KYLE-
What did you do? Those weren't even here for the escape room.
Where did you even get those? (sighs) ♪ (gentle, upbeat music ♪ "Hello Bees") ♪
-MATT-
And welcome back.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
So.
First off, what is your marching order--
-LAURA-
Uh-oh.
-MATT-
-- as you progress? We're going to go to Pâté in a second, but I want to know.
The hallway here entrance is about 15 feet wide at the area where you are.
So you can go in waves of three if you want to fill the space.
-TRAVIS-
I'll take it because I got darkvision.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
I'll take it because my eardrums are alive.
-TRAVIS-
Super keen.
-LAURA-
Are you turning off that light source--
-LIAM-
I think so. I think so.
-LAURA-
-- as you walk?
-TALIESIN-
Let's put somebody in back--
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to go behind Orym.
-TALIESIN-
-- who's got darkvision, too.
-LAURA-
Who else has darkvision?
-TRAVIS-
I think Orym and I will be up--
-ASHLEY-
Oh, wait.
Yeah, I can't see shit.
-TRAVIS-
-- 50 feet up--
-LAURA-
I don't know who has darkvision.
-TRAVIS-
-- in front of everybody.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Are we in the dark?
-MARISHA-
I'll be up front too because I also have darkvision.
-MATT-
I mean--
-TALIESIN-
Well, we need someone in back with darkvision too.
-MATT-
Here's the thing, yeah.
-MARISHA-
That's fair, I'll be in back with darkvision.
-MATT-
It is very lightless within.
So most of you would be blind if there is no light source.
-LAURA-
Mm.
-TRAVIS-
Elephant walk.
-MATT-
As long as you're cool with that.
-LAURA-
Can I turn on-- Can I turn on? Can I bring up my lights?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
But keep them dim?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Can I control?
-MATT-
They're dim by nature.
I'll say you can control them to--
-TALIESIN-
Keep them in the center.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
-- a night light.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
♪ Night light ♪
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
♪ Night light ♪
-MATT-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
I'll hang back in the back group.
I'm haunted by it, so I'm going to assume Dorian's haunted by that breath that we heard.
-LAURA-
Mm!
-ROBBIE-
It just felt otherworldly and nothing's there, so I think I'm going to cast See Invisibility.
-LIAM-
Mm.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
That's a 2nd-level spell, so I should be safe.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
That does also allow me to see into the ethereal plane.
-MATT-
Correct.
-ROBBIE-
So ethereal creatures and objects.
-MATT-
Indeed.
-LAURA-
Sweet.
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-ROBBIE-
Just in case.
-MATT-
It's not concentration, so it lasts for an hour.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah. Right, just one hour.
-LAURA-
I'll walk in front of Dorian.
-MATT-
You got it.
-ROBBIE-
It gave me the spookies.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Spoopies.
-MATT-
Ashton, where are you? Are you with Fearne?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, right behind.
Yeah, right there.
Just so I want to be able to move fast if something goes wrong to either side.
-LAURA-
Or I'll walk next to--
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's great!
-LAURA-
I'll walk next to Dorian.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Amazing.
-LAURA-
Laudna said she was going to be up front.
-MATT-
Okay, so Laudna, you're up front with--
-MARISHA-
I'll be in the middle.
-MATT-
All right, Essek's going to stay next to Ashton.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
After seeing what you did, he's like, "I would prefer to have somebody get in the way if something comes at me quickly."
-TALIESIN-
I'm very good at that.
-LIAM-
Let's go, Pop.
-MATT-
As the globules of crackling energy gently drift along with you as you step, alighting the footfalls ahead of you.
Slowly, you see the unveiling of the smooth bits Slowly, you see the unveiling of the smooth bits of marbled stone floors and the scattering of broken stone that is occasionally cast from the nearby partially ruined fallen in walls.
The crumbled piles and the occasional gap you can see above that leads up to the seventh floor above you, up into shadow as well.
Pressing forward, there is a slick layer there is a slick layer that reflects the light.
Everything here is ever so faintly moist.
The temperature is warmer than the central city The temperature is warmer than the central city and there is no frost gathering in this area either.
There are a number of places in the city where magically the temperature fluctuates drastically, and there's places that are ice coated in frost and some places that are temperate and warm.
This is like a warmth interior.
That smell, that sweet rotting fruit smell is stronger here, That smell, that sweet rotting fruit smell is stronger here, but it has an acrid bile sort of smell that mixes with it.
It's this sweet and sick that makes you uncomfortable.
You continue on for about 80, 100 feet or so.
It's just straight hallway, only parts of it fallen in and continuing to separate.
You come upon the first open door.
-TRAVIS-
Is that trail still 80, 100 feet still going, that blood line?
-MATT-
The trail's still going.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
It's not super thick, it's--
-TRAVIS-
If it stops for some reason, I'd like to stop--
-MATT-
I'll let you know.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
I'm still looking through Pâté, linked arms with Fearne as I look through.
-ASHLEY-
I'm holding onto her.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
You also said there was stone scatter.
Did we see any rock pushed out of the way, like something had been pulled through, through that stone scatter?
-MATT-
In the areas where you are--
-LIAM-
Or did the goo just trail over it in a straight line?
-MATT-
No.
Where you see it, it's a dragged smear and the stones are pulled with it.
-LIAM-
Along the way. Okay.
-MATT-
It's just a faint smear.
It's not a heavy amount of blood, but it's enough to still leave in some places a dotted line, faint trail that's being dragged through.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Make a perception check for Pâté for me, if you don't mind.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Spooky.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance?
-MARISHA-
Mm.
-LIAM-
Guidance on Pâté?
-MATT-
I'll allow it.
-MARISHA-
I'll take it.
-LIAM-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
12.
-MATT-
Okay.
He glances about and he sees that same doorway to the left.
It has a somewhat angular archway that comes to, not a full smoothed archway or a flat surface, like a refracted gem peak to it, and a smooth metal frame to it and an interior from there that is--
-MARISHA-
It's open?
It's open, yeah.
There's no door there.
It's just an arch.
I tell Pâté to peek in.
-MATT-
Peeks in.
Better look than what he can tell, there is a door on the opposite end that is open.
So it looks like it's a push inward type of door.
There is a bar handle on it.
It's no wider than maybe 30 by 25 feet.
25 feet wide and about 30 feet from where the door is.
At a first glance, it looks like it was once a storage chamber of some kind.
There's large sections of piping, sections of pipes that are set to the side of various widths and thickness.
There are massive containers that are stacked up, some that are tipped to one side and are empty.
A number of other stacked bits up to almost the corner of the room.
You see odd bits of loose cabling that are wound up and placed in a pile.
-MARISHA-
You said there's another door across the way that also looks--
-MATT-
No, that's the entirety of this chamber.
-MARISHA-
All right.
I flag to the others.
Looks like this is a storage unit up ahead.
On the left, you said that was?
-MATT-
On the left side, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay. I tell Pâté to come out and keep scouting ahead for us so--
-LAURA-
No movement on the inside of that thing?
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Not that he could see, but, you know, he's not the brightest in the bunch.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
How far away, how far ahead is he and us?
-MATT-
Well, how far ahead of you do you want him to be?
-MARISHA-
I mean, I'd say at least 100, 120 feet.
Let's say 120 feet at least.
-MATT-
120 feet? Okay, this changes things.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, he can be pretty far ahead.
-MATT-
Okay. So you guys, you just start stepping into the hallway and seeing these things when Pâté picks up the side of this door.
-MARISHA-
Okay, so I flag them that there's a turn storage thing.
-MATT-
Okay.
You all continue to walk along carefully in this dark, ominous hall.
About 40 feet beyond that, there is another door that is partially closed, slightly ajar on the right hand side opposite end.
-MARISHA-
He peeks in.
-MATT-
Okay.
He scoots in. Make a perception check for him.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance.
-MARISHA-
Guid-da-dance.
That's still a d4, right?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
It hasn't changed? All right, it's a little better.
17.
-MATT-
17.
He crawls in to the side of the wall on the inside, glances about.
This, a little bit wider than the previous chamber.
This has a number of stools arranged and cluttered into one corner.
There are six large glass cylindrical containers that are stacked on the far wall.
One of them looks fallen and shattered all over the ground and there's broken glass that fills the entirety of the space within.
There are shelves that have movable pieces that he can't really see from where he's standing.
Flies up and looks, and most of them look empty.
That's pretty much the best that he can make out from the cursory glance.
-TRAVIS-
You have See Invisibility up?
-ROBBIE-
I do, I can see him.
-TRAVIS-
Can you do a check and make sure there are no things watching us?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, I think Dorian's been scanning for it since he's walked into this room.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Just seeing if there's any wisps in the shadow while simultaneously watching Pâté and hoping he's not triggering a trap or doing something that a horny rat would do.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
So you're following him into the chamber?
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
No, I'm serious, because Pâté's 100 feet ahead of you guys.
-LIAM-
He's really far ahead of us.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, he's like 120 feet up, right?
-MATT-
Yeah, so he's giving you the quick heads up of what's coming, and then you eventually approach and gather as he's moving ahead.
-MARISHA-
He can just see him and everything?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, I think I've been absentmindedly following him while I've been watching him, but.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
I'm maybe 30 feet away, something like that.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
So you scouted way ahead of us then.
-LAURA-
You went way ahead.
-ROBBIE-
I just was dialed in, watching him move--
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Love it.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
-- while looking around.
-MATT-
Okay, and you do not have darkvision, correct?
-ROBBIE-
I do not.
-LAURA-
I'm going to say in Dorian's brain: What, Dorian?
-ROBBIE-
(sputters)
-LAURA-
You know you're getting pretty far ahead of us.
-ROBBIE-
Sorry, sorry. I know.
-LAURA-
No, I mean, if that's what you want.
-ROBBIE-
No, it's not what I want.
It sounds like it shouldn't be what I want.
But I'll stop.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Can you see anything?
-ROBBIE-
Not really anymore.
-LIAM-
I whisper up the hall.
-ROBBIE-
The further we get away, I think that's why I got away from the group is the further I get away from your light, I'm--
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
-- I'm losing, even though I can see invisibility, I can't see anything.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Yeah, you can see him.
In a weird way, it's darkness, but there's a little bit of a faint halo that is Pâté, and so you're following this little light as it flutters down the hallway.
Then it vanishes into the room, and that's when you lose focus on him and realize how far you've wandered from the group.
You draw back and reconvene.
So you pass the room on the left.
-MARISHA-
I tell everybody else: Looks like this room past us on right is maybe some kind of laboratory, maybe.
I'm seeing rows of glass.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MARISHA-
Glass cylinders.
-ASHLEY-
Are they all still closed? Are any of them broken open?
-MARISHA-
The doors? Can I have Pâté investigate further and see if-- You said one of the cylinders has crashed open?
-MATT-
One of them has fallen over and shattered.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
There's just glass all over the ground, yeah.
-LIAM-
This is the lab room on the right?
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
It's on the right.
So it's storage first on the left, lab on the right.
-MATT-
You can roll an investigation check for Pâté, if you'd like.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
Guidance?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance.
-TALIESIN-
Guidance.
-ROBBIE-
Do good.
-MARISHA-
13.
-MATT-
13? Pâté gives a--
-MARISHA-
No, that was a natural 19.
I'm sorry.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
It was hard to see in the light.
-LAURA-
It's very dark in here.
-MATT-
You just add his intelligence modifier.
-MARISHA-
Yes, cor--
-LAURA-
He's so smart.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I've been adding his wisdom modifier, but they're one separate, so he adds nothing.
So 21.
-MATT-
21.
Glancing about the inside of this room, and most of these containers are opaque or empty, either they're being stored there or he's just looking around the space.
He goes and looks up at some of the shelves up there.
Some look like they have some objects in them.
Look like they could be tools.
It's kind of hard to pull that, yanking it out, he's like, "Should I go ahead and pull it out? What do you think?"
-MARISHA-
Wait, what? What? Say it--
-MATT-
"Do you want me to rummage through things for you?"
-MARISHA-
No! No.
-MATT-
"Okay, okay." He backs out and flies out of the room as you get within 15 feet of him.
You and you see him fly out and emerge in the middle of the hall.
"It's all yours."
-MARISHA-
So he said he didn't-- What did you say again? I zoned out.
-MATT-
He didn't see anything, but he saw on some of the upper shelves there was tools or materials in there and he was asking if he could rummage through it for you.
-MARISHA-
Tools and materials, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Glass tubes are empty, right?
-LIAM-
That we know of.
-LAURA-
That's what he thought.
-MATT-
That's what he said, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
And he rolled a 21.
-LIAM-
There could be more, there could be nothing.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, he rolled pretty high, you guys.
-LIAM-
Is that humming sound that unsettled Dorian and all of us getting louder as we progress?
-LAURA-
Or have we even heard it at all?
-MATT-
No.
You just heard it the one time.
-TRAVIS-
Essek.
-LIAM-
Oh, it was a single thing? It wasn't an ongoing--
-LAURA-
Yes.
No.
-LIAM-
Cool!
-TRAVIS-
Essek have you been--
-LAURA-
I know, that makes it worse.
-TRAVIS-
-- this far before?
-LIAM-
Yes!
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, it's worse.
-LAURA-
Yeah. Right?
-LIAM-
Yes, because it's not--
-ASHLEY-
It's not a constant--
-LIAM-
-- a furnace or something.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just the pipes.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
What's that pinging noise is way better, yeah.
-MATT-
"So, I've been a bit further down this hall, but the hall has been sealed at the end.
Last time we were here, this was about as far as we got.
There should be one more chamber up here where we found a notebook at the time that made mention of the Thalamus, which is why I thought this chamber is what might at least allude to or give us information pointing to what the Vanguard is doing.
The fact that we saw a abandoned, if recently used, Vanguard waypoint at the entrance of here says that we're probably on the right trail for now."
-LIAM-
This one right here on the right?
-TRAVIS-
No, no.
-LIAM-
No, the one, the third?
-TRAVIS-
So we can skip these rooms and move down towards the end of the hallway.
-LAURA-
Yeah because Essek's been here before.
-MARISHA-
Probably picked clean.
Yeah, I send Pâté ahead.
Essek, that notebook you found, was it a new notebook or an old one, mentioning the cult?
-MATT-
"This was remnants of old papers that were recovered from elements of these research chambers.
Some of them had been already ransacked, so we only had shreds to go off of, and translating was its own challenge outside of magic to aid our eyesight.
But this region But this region here beneath the Genesis Ward, it seems to be central to a lot of the magical research and technology that was being developed within the city.
Which also makes sense as to why it's been such a focus of the Assembly's excavation and flag planting, if you will."
-ROBBIE-
So these notes about Thalamus, they're ancient notes?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-ROBBIE-
So you're saying this potential cult he was with could be as old as the prime of this city?
-MATT-
"I don't know what the Thalamus means."
-LAURA-
Occultus Thalamus.
It doesn't necessarily mean cult.
-ROBBIE-
Of, not a cult of.
-LAURA-
Occultus.
-ROBBIE-
It's so old.
-MATT-
"It could very well be.
The Thalamus was referred to as being part of this subterranean region.
But once again, we were also careful to not touch everything we found."
-LAURA-
Did your notes say anything about Dominox?
-MATT-
"No."
-LAURA-
Have you heard of anything like that?
-MATT-
"I have not."
-LAURA-
That's what they said took up residence here.
That's what they said took up residence here.
That's why Ludinus came here in the first place.
There was a creature or something that got unleashed, had taken up residence, and it was killing off the Vanguard.
-TALIESIN-
Huh.
-LIAM-
How far in here have you gotten before?
-MATT-
"I'll show you the sealed door, or at least where it might have been."
-LIAM-
This is the deepest you've ever gone in?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Is up ahead of us?
-LAURA-
Well, level nine is the deepest here.
-MATT-
"There are floors beneath this, but--"
-LIAM-
But on this floor, this is just a little bit further?
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's what he said.
-TRAVIS-
Just past the doorway at the end of the hallway.
-MATT-
"I'll let you know when we've reached the point I have not transgressed."
-LIAM-
You came in here with just one other person?
-TALIESIN-
Must have been one hell of another person.
-LIAM-
Dangerous.
-MATT-
"You're not wrong.
But even we have our limitations, and everything here is dangerous in its own right.
To even get to this point, we expended so many resources that we had to decide to return another time.
When we were ready to delve further, by then, the empire had already taken the entirety of the space.
It wasn't safe to get across."
-LAURA-
Wow.
-MATT-
"The Assembly has a tangled history with my partner and I, and um--"
-LIAM-
Oh, by, who is this guy? Or woman, or?
-MATT-
"(chuckles) He's a man.
A very powerful practitioner of the magical arts.
He is also-- Hmm.
Well, he teaches on occasion."
-ASHLEY-
Insight check.
-MATT-
Make an insight check.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Is he lying? (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
28.
-MATT-
28?
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
(gasps)
-ROBBIE-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
Whisper!
-LIAM-
He's plotting to kill you all.
-ROBBIE-
Now I can crunch as loud as I want.
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Crunch, crunch.
-MARISHA-
This whisper brought to you by.
-ROBBIE-
Mm.
-ROBBIE-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
Flaming hot puffs.
-TALIESIN-
What's that in my teeth? It's popcorn. Every time.
-MATT-
"His name is Bren, and he is very intelligent.
"His name is Bren, and he is very intelligent.
I think he might have been the one to bring you here if he wasn't otherwise occupied.
But nevertheless. (sighs) I'm sorry if my anxiety shows.
There's something about-- I dislike not knowing what's coming, especially given the stakes and what we do not know.
There are few things I hate more than not knowing."
-LAURA-
Don't worry, Seth, we got your back.
-MATT-
"So far, so good."
-MARISHA-
Send Pâté.
-MATT-
Okay.
Pâté continues on, and the left hand door, the last door that was set before the sealed portion of this hallway that Essek had mentioned, is collapsed inward.
That part of the hall has fallen in and is a blockade of rubble.
Where the other side of the wall is, similar damage.
It looks like this part of the wall, either it collapsed, or it fell in due to an intentional detonation.
But there is now a braced arch that looks like some sort of magically crafted band has been placed in that's now supporting most of this collapsed part.
Where there previously was some sort of a sealed entry point, and you see signs of it along the metal walls around you, now missing.
Essek--
-ASHLEY-
The archways have been braced later, people who have explored it and gone through--
-MATT-
Yeah, this is a fresher metal.
Either this was set here to keep it up, or the place was damaged to allow progress, and then was braced as part of that to continue to leave it open.
-TALIESIN-
Was this here last time you were here?
-MATT-
"This was not.
This in particular was a very strong magical ward that had kept us at bay with what we had left, so--"
-ASHLEY-
Who's adding these? Who puts these here?
-MATT-
"This would be the Assembly, I'm sure."
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
"Or at least the Vanguard, whoever these allies are."
-TALIESIN-
Chet, you want to check for traps? This is making me itch.
-TRAVIS-
Sure.
I'll look around the big braced doorway for traps?
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
17.
-MATT-
17. Doesn't appear to be formally trapped.
It's actually pretty sturdily built, and there's a faint-- You can sense a faint enchantment on it, so it is magically empowered in its bracing capabilities.
This is a fairly sturdy pathway.
-TALIESIN-
I was just curious if there's anything to trigger it turning off.
-MATT-
Of course, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Looks clean.
-LAURA-
Let's keep going.
-MATT-
Pâté continues to flutter ahead.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
There is now, it looks like, a small intersection.
There are two doors to each side, both that appear closed, and the hallway begins to curve a little bit to the right, just past them.
-LAURA-
Where's that blood go?
-TALIESIN-
In your body, I hope.
-MATT-
Blood is continuing down this hall.
-MARISHA-
In both of the--
-ROBBIE-
A lot of blood.
-TALIESIN-
It's like a hospital line.
-MATT-
This very, very thin trail, and it is fading as it goes.
It's getting lighter and lighter.
-MARISHA-
So two doors on either side that look shut.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
Do they look sealed, or just, someone pulled the door closed?
-MATT-
Roll a perception check for Pâté.
-MARISHA-
(as Pâté) Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance.
-MARISHA-
(as Pâté) Guidance.
-LIAM-
Still a hundred plus--
-ROBBIE-
Oh wow, you're crushing it.
-MARISHA-
19.
-MATT-
19. You glance at the doors.
They are closed, and they have the same iron handles on them.
You can see that in one of the doors, there is a stone-- A square stone, about that big, that is placed right next to the iron handle.
The other door itself is closed, does not have this, but they're both just shut.
-TRAVIS-
There's a square stone in the door? Inlaid?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Does it have writing on it or anything like that?
-MATT-
No writing.
-MARISHA-
A mark? All right.
I convey this to the others. Two doors, just shut.
Maybe now is the time to check for traps.
-TRAVIS-
I can do another check.
-MARISHA-
If we want to go in.
Or we just keep going straight.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, Essek, have you been in these ones?
-LAURA-
He hasn't gone past that--
-MATT-
"We've reached my point of--"
-ASHLEY-
Your point, okay.
-MATT-
"-- mystery."
-TALIESIN-
Right here?
-MATT-
"Well." He points at the brace.
-TALIESIN-
Wow, we are-- Not a lot of people who've been this far down in the last hundred-so years.
Feels good.
-ROBBIE-
It's exciting.
-MATT-
He points down to the--
-TALIESIN-
Mages.
-MATT-
-- numerous steps that push through the--
-TRAVIS-
Footprints? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Not a ton.
-MATT-
"Correct, we are probably among the 50 or so."
-TALIESIN-
That's very fucking impressive.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"You're not wrong."
-TALIESIN-
I'm not kidding.
-MARISHA-
No, we know.
-TALIESIN-
And the fucking moon.
-LAURA-
Let's go.
-ROBBIE-
Top 50.
-LAURA-
I think we should--
-MARISHA-
Are we popping in these doors, or just keep going?
-LAURA-
I feel like we should just--
-LIAM-
I'm not going to touch anything, but are we catching up to this point?
-MARISHA-
He's still a little ahead.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, at least 60 feet.
-LIAM-
But he's moving forward?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, he's moving forward.
-LIAM-
I'm curious if that stone, it's a stone square in the middle of the door?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
I'm not touching it.
Does it look movable? Is it inlaid--
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-LIAM-
That's not going to go well.
-MARISHA-
Look at Pâté.
-ROBBIE-
I'm still following.
-MARISHA-
He's like a little sky dancer.
-LIAM-
10.
-MATT-
I mean, it's made of a different stone than the rest of the door.
The door, it has elements of stone in it, but a lot of it is a metal, almost a brass or even tin color.
You're not quite sure what the material is.
This stone square doesn't match the rest of it.
-LIAM-
No writing of any kind that we can't read, or decoration? Okay, plain.
-TRAVIS-
Is the stone colored at all?
-MATT-
It's an off-white, where the rest of the metal there has almost a richer orange, brass coloration to it.
-LIAM-
It is at scary as a wooden chair?
-MARISHA-
I know.
-MATT-
Could be.
-LIAM-
Mm.
-LAURA-
Did you check it for traps?
-TRAVIS-
The door?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
What if we push on it?
-LIAM-
Well, let's check it for traps first.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, sure, I'll give it a trap check.
-MARISHA-
Chickity-check.
-TRAVIS-
11.
-MATT-
11.
No traps.
-TRAVIS-
Not trapped. Give it a push.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
You push on the stone?
-LAURA-
I'm going to step away.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I don't know, because the way you said that.
-TRAVIS-
Just push it!
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I'll push it.
-LIAM-
I step away too.
-MATT-
Okay. You push the stone.
(creaks) The door opens slightly. Nothing.
-TRAVIS-
Fucker.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
It is like a chair.
-TALIESIN-
Honestly, I want to--
-LAURA-
Can we peek our head in and look?
-ASHLEY-
Does it feel like if I touch the stone, that there could be anything that once was carved into it?
-TRAVIS-
The door is open.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, but maybe there used to be writing, but it broke? I don't know. It just feels like flat stone?
-MATT-
Feels like flat stone, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
What does it mean? Why is there a square--
-LAURA-
It's magic. It's all magic.
-ASHLEY-
Why is there dumb square right here? It's got to mean something.
-TALIESIN-
I'm starting to peek the head in.
-LAURA-
Maybe it's just--
-TALIESIN-
There's no light.
-MATT-
You want to pass the room?
-ASHLEY-
Is this the square room?
-LIAM-
I'm just looking in.
-TALIESIN-
Peeking in.
-MATT-
You're looking in the room.
-LIAM-
Yes, in the room.
-MATT-
Okay.
You glance in.
On the opposite side of the door is a matching piece of stone that has a faintly glowing glyph on it.
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-MATT-
It looks like the stone is enchanted in some way.
You glance in the rest of the room. It's a fairly wide room.
It's about twice as large as the other ones you've seen.
This has a number of tables that are smashed to one side, like they've all been shifted together into one space, and there are a half dozen ancient corpses in here, not unlike the ones you saw in the city above, nearly mummified in the lack of moisture that's been within this chamber.
The skin is still paper-thin, stretched against the skeletons, as they're all on the ground, jaws open, aghast.
-LIAM-
Are there any velociraptors hiding in here?
-MATT-
What are you looking for? Velociraptors?
-LIAM-
Threats. Threats.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Threats. 27 perception.
-MATT-
27 in this room.
You don't see any creatures, but you hear something.
-TALIESIN-
That's--
-MATT-
You look across where these tables are smashed together.
There is broken glass. There are long coils of tubing.
You can see what look to be other implements and tools, long, thin pieces of metal with hooks on the end.
Things you don't recognize.
There is one of those similar glass containers you saw in the previous chamber that's aloft and in the far back corner, and as you hear the sound, it's coming from it.
It looks opaque, like something is stained or smeared the glass from the inside.
-MARISHA-
Cool.
-MATT-
You hear-- (glooping bubbling)
-LIAM-
Does it seem like it has air on the inside of it, or fluid, or can't tell?
-MATT-
You glance in a little closer, and each time those little (burbles) happens, that dark shape, that opaqueness of the glass, shifts.
It looks like boiling tar.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's-- Great. That's great.
-LIAM-
I don't think we need to fuck with that.
-LAURA-
You know, here's the thing.
I feel like any of these rooms have been picked clean by the Assembly, and maybe these squares are warning signs.
Like, "Hey, don't go in these rooms."
-TALIESIN-
Gently close the door? Gently, let's just let it sleep.
They clearly want their sleep. Let's just--
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm going to back-- Well, I'll take a second to look at the ancient corpses on the floor.
-ASHLEY-
Maybe this is where they go to get boba.
-TRAVIS-
Can Essek make anything of the glyph on the stone?
-MATT-
Essek comes into the chamber and looks at it.
"Yes, this is for locking it from the inside.
If you were to place your hand upon this glyph, it would put an arcane lock on the door that would only be able to be opened by the individual that had set it from the opposite side.
So this was for locking the interior, and glancing around within here, this was an experimentation room of some kind." He dips down and starts looking at the implements around here.
"This was an enchantment room.
A lot of these here are used for holy magical essences, sometimes within various schools of arcana.
Here," and he puts into part of the rubble here and pulls up carefully, brushing off, what looks to be a sword blank, a shortsword blank.
He goes, "You can see there, the beginnings of runic carvings in here.
It looks like this might have been an extension of an experimental armory, or it might have even been a production house for the Aeorian military, I'm not certain."
-LAURA-
All right.
-LIAM-
That's a shortsword blade? Without hilt?
-MATT-
Correct, it's a blank, and it looks like it's partially carved.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Takes it and looks it over.
"It's not magical.
It looks like they began the process of preparing it for enchantment, and it was discarded." He sets it on the ground.
-TALIESIN-
Clearly, they got busy.
-TRAVIS-
We should keep moving.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Pâté is still ahead.
-MATT-
Okay.
You back out and close the door? All right.
Close the door behind. There's the door to the right.
Do you continue on forward?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, Pâté didn't check those out. He kept moving.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
At least, I don't.
-MATT-
You push on, and Pâté enters a space where the hallway begins to open up into a larger chamber.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
He has darkvision, right?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
He has Demon's Sight, too, so he can also see through magical darkness.
-MATT-
Right, right.
He peers in here, and you're looking through his eyes.
-MARISHA-
Devil's Sight is what it's called. Sorry, keep going.
-MATT-
Peering through his eyes, this chamber, it's almost like the end of this hall, but there's, and some of you pick it up, too, there's that smell that you found earlier.
It's getting stronger and stronger the further you push into it.
Now it's carrying a metallic taste on your tongue.
This is less of a solid room, but it looks like a waypoint.
There are tunnels to the right and left and across the way, a larger square, somewhat rounded square chamber, and this is where multiple, four different halls conjoin.
The floor is completely littered with more of these ancient corpses, all in similar states of ancient decay.
That isn't what catches your attention through Pâté, though.
What catches your eyes through his eyes immediately are the many chains that hang from the ceiling in here, dangling from the ruined stone above.
Black, jagged chains, many ending in wicked-looking hooks, and atop many of these hooks are hanging bodies--
-LAURA-
Ugh!
-ASHLEY-
Whoa.
-MATT-
-- still and aloft, feet inches, sometimes feet above the ground, different heights.
-LIAM-
Ancient bodies?
-MATT-
Have Pâté make an investigation check.
Or perception, your choice.
-LIAM-
Because we're not here yet. It's just Pâté.
-MARISHA-
It's just Pâté.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance.
-LIAM-
Come on, Patty.
-MARISHA-
I mean, it's still an intelligence roll, right?
-LIAM-
(Irish) Come on, Patty!
-ASHLEY-
Guidance, Guidance.
Guidance!
-MATT-
Intelligence or wisdom.
Perception is wisdom, intelligence is investigation.
-MARISHA-
Okay, so I was doing it right, then.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
When you said perception earlier, okay.
-LIAM-
(Irish) Let's fucking go, Patty.
-MARISHA-
Mm, mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah, we'll use wisdom, plus he's a little bit smarter.
So that's 22. I rolled a 19 for him.
-MATT-
22.
The withered bodies on the ground are skeletal, beyond the element of mummified remains and paper-thin flesh across, those that still have it, mummified in these moments of chaos and horror.
The bodies on these chains are meaty.
-MARISHA-
Ah!
-LIAM-
Oh, for fuck's sake.
-MATT-
They are recent.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god. Okay.
-MATT-
They are full, and many of them have on them familiar attire.
-MARISHA-
Vanguard attire?
-MATT-
Vanguard robes, armor wearing emblems and symbols, some hanging on it through the back, some hanging on the front, carved under the sternum, hanging on the inside of their ribcage, between.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Go ahead, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Is that your reaction? You laugh?
-MARISHA-
(maniacal laugh)
-LIAM-
Blind, in this hallway.
-MARISHA-
That was just Marisha.
Because this is dope!
-MATT-
There's over a dozen bodies that hang in this room.
-MARISHA-
A dozen?
-LAURA-
Can Pâté look up?
-MARISHA-
Yeah. He looks up.
-MATT-
They're all emerging from the stone.
They're not affixed to anything, it looks like.
-LIAM-
There's nothing hanging out on the ceiling?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Not that Pâté sees.
-MATT-
Make another perception check, if you'd like.
-MARISHA-
Real quick, while he's--
-MATT-
We'll go with the one he spent already. He looks up.
He doesn't see anything on the ceiling beyond, there are elements of stone that are cracked through, and there's maybe, here and there, a bit of ceiling that has fallen, and you can see a dark gap maybe a few inches wide that maybe proceeds into the 7th floor above.
But most of the chains are just emerging from the stone.
-LAURA-
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
-MARISHA-
Just emerging? Like they were mounted in there?
-TRAVIS-
Let's get in there.
-MARISHA-
While he's investigating the bodies, does any of it look familiar from the encampment we saw earlier with the euphoric, manic smile on any of their faces? Like the murder-suicide that we saw?
-MATT-
I'd say a little over half of them carry a strange, final grin across their face.
-LAURA-
Eee! Dominox!
-MARISHA-
Dominox.
It's in his name.
-LIAM-
(sword unsheathing)
-MARISHA-
Yes, I tell everybody this. About a dozen bodies.
They're fleshy, they're plump, and a few have that maniacal, euphoric grin on their faces, so whatever this Dominox is, I'm starting to understand why Ludinus had to come out here and make it his problem.
-LAURA-
You didn't happen to see Ludinus on one of those chains, did you?
-MARISHA-
Did I happen to see-- (mumbling)
-TALIESIN-
What a way to go.
-MATT-
None of them looked quite Ludinus-like.
-MARISHA-
Campaign over.
-MATT-
Yeah, look at that! (cheering)
-LIAM-
Thanks, Dominox.
-LAURA-
Thanks, Dominox!
-MATT-
Big bad: Offscreen.
Sorry, guys.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Time for margaritas.
-LIAM-
Hi, Dominox.
You're my favorite customer.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Just in case things go really bad, I'm immune to poison.
I think I should just mention that now.
-LAURA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
Just in case.
-MARISHA-
Go ahead.
-ROBBIE-
No, go ahead.
-MARISHA-
I was going to have him, so there's a big open chamber, four open tunnels, it looks like, that look very open.
-MATT-
Well, three other ones beyond the one that you're going through.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Is there any kind of-- Well, it's dark as shit, isn't it?
-LIAM-
Pitch dark?
-ROBBIE-
It's still pitch dark.
-MATT-
It is pitch black in there.
-MARISHA-
But you can ask me, and I can ask Pâté.
-MATT-
You guys are still way behind Pâté.
-MARISHA-
We're still around the corner, right? We haven't entered.
What do you want me to ask him?
-ROBBIE-
If there's any sort of technology or anything that you can see.
Does this feel like another laboratory?
-MARISHA-
Does it look like a laboratory?
-LIAM-
What's technology.
-ROBBIE-
Technology?
-MARISHA-
Or is it just--
-ROBBIE-
Technology?
-TALIESIN-
We have technology, we do.
-MATT-
If you're looking through his eyes--
-TALIESIN-
Whitestone is nothing but tech!
-MATT-
-- then you are seeing what you can see.
-TRAVIS-
Let's just get in there.
-LIAM-
What do you know about Whitestone?
-TALIESIN-
We were just there!
-LIAM-
I just saw the sitting room.
-TALIESIN-
Percy gave me a tour.
He thought you were all lame.
(laughter)
-MATT-
It's like roleplay masturbation.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-LIAM-
Oh, it's all love seats and oil paintings.
-MATT-
My character gave my character everything cool.
-LIAM-
What technology.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
We hung for a second, I thought we bonded. Anyway.
-MATT-
No, you did, you did.
No, I'm not disagreeing, I just find it amusing, in a meta-textual sense.
-TALIESIN-
We made out off-screen.
Anyway, sorry.
-MATT-
(laughs) He needed it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
He begins to flutter from body to body, and glancing around the space within.
You can see among the chains, the ground itself also has this tangled weave of long chains that pull through and knot and yank the other side.
Between the bits of fallen stone, you can see shattered furniture and some that still partially stands.
He begins to flutter past the centerpiece, and he's like, "I don't know if it's a laboratory, but there's different rooms.
It's this way, one this way, and this one, and this way."
-MARISHA-
So you said there's a lot of chains littering the ground as well.
What if it's some sort of nightmarish, possessed, Aeorian tech that's using chains to reach out and grab people?
-LAURA-
Maybe that's what it is.
-TALIESIN-
I like that.
-LAURA-
Did he say? I zoned out because I was looking at my spell list.
-MARISHA-
It's all right, I did it earlier.
-LIAM-
Happens all the time.
-LAURA-
Did he say that the chains were leading through a certain set of doors? There was chains leading anywhere?
-TALIESIN-
No, it was just a--
-MARISHA-
I think it's just everywhere, but the chains are just appearing.
I don't know, watch the ground.
I feel like everyone should watch where we step.
-LAURA-
The body that got dragged, whatever got dragged was a blood trail, right? Does it end in that room? Did it get yanked up?
-MARISHA-
I think we're going to have to go in.
-MATT-
Your connection to Pâté is lost.
-MARISHA-
No! (groaning)
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-LIAM-
Shit, he just got eaten up.
-ASHLEY-
Why?
-LAURA-
Oh d'oh.
-TRAVIS-
Thank god.
-LIAM-
He just got eaten up, it's on us now.
-MARISHA-
No.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Can we go in now?
-MARISHA-
Wha--
-ASHLEY-
Chet, what if you geometry or something?
-TRAVIS-
I take off running for the room.
-MARISHA-
Watch your feet, Chet!
-ROBBIE-
Do it!
-TRAVIS-
Christ.
(laughter)
If we stand out in this goddamn hallway any longer I'm going to die of old age.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I'm sorry for protecting your ass.
-ROBBIE-
If any character was going to die of old age.
-MATT-
(laughs) Yeah, it makes sense for Chetney.
-TALIESIN-
Not if he can help it.
-MARISHA-
All right, watch your feet.
I think this is bad; he got eaten or something.
-LAURA-
Okay, we take off after Chet who's--
-MARISHA-
I'm going to--
-LIAM-
I think we should tippy-toe around--
-ASHLEY-
I don't know, ah.
-LIAM-
-- or if you want to run all balls to the walls.
Let's go.
-TRAVIS-
"Meh, meh, meh, meh," get in the fucking room.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going walk briskly.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going walk briskly--
-LIAM-
No, I want to sneak up to the room.
-TALIESIN-
-- because I want him to set off a bunch of shit before we get there.
-LIAM-
We got to roleplay it.
-ASHLEY-
We want Chet going first.
-MATT-
You guys all charge in behind Chet.
-LIAM-
Aw.
-MARISHA-
We're not charging.
-TALIESIN-
Charge is a harsh word.
-MARISHA-
Form of Dread.
-TRAVIS-
Just me, just me--
-ASHLEY-
No!
-TALIESIN-
I'll take it, just me.
-MATT-
Okay, okay.
-LIAM-
No, I'm fucking following, you motherfucker.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, we're walking.
-MARISHA-
We all go in--
-MATT-
You careful approach at a distance.
-MARISHA-
-- but I'm going to Form of Dread, please.
-MATT-
You Form of Dread (whooshes).
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Shifting.
Your Form of Dread resembles at this moment--?
-MARISHA-
It's toned down from what Imogen saw the other day, but a little mourning veil comes overtop of me, I look a little banshee-esque.
-MATT-
You got it.
As you all drift in, you go in, and as the light falls in, you can see, indeed, the floor here is slick.
The chains around here are blood-coated.
The chains around here are blood-coated.
There are pools beneath many of these bodies, and two of them look like they're even still dripping.
-ROBBIE-
(sighs)
-MARISHA-
So fresh.
-LAURA-
Ew.
-LIAM-
Orym is on Chetney's six.
-MATT-
Fresh enough to where it's faint, every now and then, just a drop. (plops) You glance around rapidly where you lost contact and you see Pâté on the ground.
Skull, body, just no longer active.
-LAURA-
And he had been invisible.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
Can I (sniffs) do a double sniff and also activate my training from Hunter's Bane for fey, fiends, or undead just to rule that out?
-MATT-
Sure, go ahead and--
-MARISHA-
Wait, no longer active, like--
-LAURA-
I'm going to--
-MARISHA-
-- the magical force got sucked out of him?
-MATT-
It's no longer present.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-LAURA-
Oh fuck.
-MATT-
15, I mean--
-ASHLEY-
What if we float through or fly through so we don't have to touch the ground.
-LAURA-
I know.
-MATT-
Something about the smell in this place, the scent <i>distinctly</i> feels fiendish.
the scent <i>distinctly</i> feels fiendish.
-TRAVIS-
I was wondering.
-MATT-
It just permeates the air here, subtly and sourcelessly--
-TRAVIS-
Oh, chains.
-MATT-
Everywhere.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
Being a Pact of the Chain warlock, anything fucking is tingling?
-MATT-
I mean, it looks pretty terrifying and fiendish in nature.
-TRAVIS-
I'll go in.
-MATT-
If you want to make a religion check or an arcana check to see if you can pick up any sort of possible information from what you see before you.
-LIAM-
Are we saying we've all run up to the outside of this door at this point?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I think we've all crept up.
-LIAM-
Okay, so we've got light source then, to a degree, as well, from you.
-MATT-
From Imogen kind of leading with you.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to keep eyes on the back.
-MATT-
Unless you prefer otherwise.
-MARISHA-
Not big.
-LAURA-
We need light.
-LIAM-
I can't see.
-MATT-
You can keep stumbling through the dark if you want.
-LAURA-
The only other thing you could do is turn the lantern on.
-ROBBIE-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
That's is good.
-LIAM-
If you prefer.
-LAURA-
Because my lights are a concentration spell, so.
-LIAM-
That's a good call.
I think you die yours down, I'll turn the lantern on.
-LAURA-
(lights diminish)
-LIAM-
I'm stepping in behind Chetney and I am scanning every corner of the room for movement threats.
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast Fly on myself--
-MATT-
Perception check.
-MARISHA-
16.
-LAURA-
-- just to get off the ground.
-TALIESIN-
Keeping eyes on the back of us.
-MARISHA-
16 on arcana.
-MATT-
16 on arcana.
-LAURA-
I rolled a three--
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
-- on the magic.
-MATT-
What you do notice is the chains, not even affixed to anything, they look like they were conjured through the stone.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Hmm.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Growing out of the stone?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
(shuddering) Oh.
-TRAVIS-
I'm having the quietest Hybrid Transformation ever, just-- (tiny wolf squeak)
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(slo-mo transformation)
-TALIESIN-
You sound like a haircut--
-LIAM-
Just quietly peeling.
-TALIESIN-
-- in reverse.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Skin.
-LIAM-
Peeling the gnome skin off.
-MATT-
What'd you roll?
-LIAM-
27.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-MATT-
27, okay.
-MARISHA-
I'm taking a cue off of Imogen.
I'm going to also cast Spider Climb on myself so I can skitter--
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
-- along the walls, and I just tell everybody: These chains were not built here, it's like they were conjured.
Watch them.
-MATT-
You look through here and you see where some of the bodies are.
Some of them are holding on the chains, like they were trying to either pull themselves off of it or pull themselves on.
-TRAVIS-
Cool.
-MATT-
You also see a number of the bodies in the ground that the chains have fallen over, the ancient corpses that litter this ground.
You see two of them that are much more armored than others.
The skeleton lies, barely hanging inside a breastplate with ornate scrolling across it, and a tattered cloak that's mostly buried over these dark chains that knot over it.
Essek's kind of gloating in the middle of the chamber, taking this all in, and going, "This is extremely upsetting, and I only wish, maybe, perchance we hadn't come here."
-MARISHA-
Does Pâté look like, you said he's on the ground dormant now?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Does he look like he got got by a chain?
-MATT-
There's no signs of any puncture, no chain.
It's like whatever enchantment held him in place was ended.
-LAURA-
I want to get out of this room.
-TRAVIS-
Inside the room--
-ASHLEY-
I don't like this room.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
-- how many different doorways or, yeah, how many different rooms are there?
-LIAM-
Three passages out, if I remember, right?
-TRAVIS-
Three out?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, there's three ways out of here.
-TALIESIN-
Left, right, and center.
-MATT-
Essek reaches into a bag and pulls out a brass bracelet with a finger bone laid in the center of it.
He holds it for a second.
"If we're looking for information, this might be of help to us.
Is there any particular corpse here that we think might be useful?"
-TRAVIS-
(laughs softly)
-LAURA-
Maybe one of the more armored ones.
-TRAVIS-
Or the freshest one.
-LAURA-
Could be higher ups.
-TALIESIN-
You want one still in the can or do you want one that still hasn't lost its expiration date?
-TRAVIS-
I guess older would be better than fresher, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah, right?
-MATT-
"Either is useful really, it depends on what information we're looking for."
-LAURA-
I think whatever is the most decorated-looking one probably has the most information.
-LIAM-
Or that has Cerberus affiliation by dress.
-MATT-
Looking around, there are the ancient bodies that are well dressed and seem to hold station within likely the time of Aeor, or there are the more fresh Vanguard figures.
-LAURA-
I think fresh. Fresh.
-ASHLEY-
I think we need fresh.
Because that would be a different--
-TALIESIN-
Fresh won't know what this is, they'll just know what happened and some stuff about our current situation.
The older ones will know what this is, but nothing about--
-LAURA-
No, the older ones, this has taken up residence after this went down.
-LIAM-
Yes, it's a more recent--
-MARISHA-
That's what they said, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LAURA-
Yeah, newer.
-MARISHA-
Newer for sure.
-TALIESIN-
Then go.
-MATT-
"Pick one."
-LAURA-
Did you say there were ones with armor on them?
-LIAM-
Well, there was one with a breastplate.
-MATT-
Well, the bodies that you--
-LAURA-
Were those ancient--
-MATT-
Those are the ancient ones.
-LIAM-
Those are the ancient ones?
-LAURA-
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
Correct, yeah, that was the skeletal ones--
-LIAM-
No, then we're looking freshies.
-MATT-
-- inside the armor.
-TALIESIN-
What's the easiest? Do we want a grinner or do we not want a grinner?
-LAURA-
I don't think we want--
-MARISHA-
Non-grinner.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Because maybe their brain wasn't taken over.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Mm.
-TALIESIN-
How close is the closest one hanging from the ceiling?
-MATT-
Maybe about five feet from you.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It's just hanging, the hook is up under it's back--
-LAURA-
I don't think we need to, don't pull him down.
-MATT-
-- its shoulder's up.
-LAURA-
I don't want anything aware.
-MATT-
It just sits there, its head down.
-TRAVIS-
Are we seeing that rune--
-LAURA-
Talk to them.
-TRAVIS-
-- symbol anywhere, by the way?
-MATT-
The which symbol?
-TRAVIS-
The rune symbol that was carved into that guy's chest?
-LIAM-
In the tent.
-ASHLEY-
The two circles on the--
-MATT-
You don't see it in the surroundings, necessarily.
-TALIESIN-
Or carved in the bodies?
-MATT-
If you want to start-- They're all clothed.
-TALIESIN-
No, okay.
I was just seeing if something was cut open or otherwise, but.
-MATT-
Nothing at an immediate glance, but you can inspect any of them if you'd like to.
-TALIESIN-
I'm not going in yet, no.
-MARISHA-
Essek, just take this non-smiley guy closest to us.
-MATT-
"Does anybody else want to do this? (laughs nervously)"
-LAURA-
What is it? Is it Speak With the Dead?
-MATT-
"It is a charm that allows, twice per day, the ability to--"
-ASHLEY-
Oh, cool.
-MATT-
"-- speak with those who have passed.
It was given to me by a friend.
To be perfectly honest, it kind of creeps me out, especially in these circumstances."
-LAURA-
Here.
-MARISHA-
You can fly to it, yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I'll float up in front of it.
-MATT-
As you get close, you can see in more detail the body.
This appears to be a woman with mousey brown hair that's long and wrapped, covering part of her face.
The one eye still open that you can see, and the grin curving up on the side.
-LAURA-
Oh, she has a grin.
-MATT-
She does, yeah.
-LAURA-
Where's one that doesn't got a grin?
-MATT-
You go past that to one of the nearest bodies that you see is clutching the hook.
As you approach this, this is an older man, looks like he has some orcish lineage, but mostly human.
The teeth are poking through, but he has multiple puncture wounds across his shoulders.
He's not wearing the heavy robes, he's wearing some breastplate with an insignia over the shoulder.
You look and see, he was clutching the chains, and where his hands would go limp, his hands have gotten hooked on the jagged edges of the chains and are now part of the presentation.
-LAURA-
Oh, great.
Cool.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Orym is for sure listening to Imogen for whatever she's about to do, but I'm going to step towards the three passages and train my hearing and sight in those directions--
-LAURA-
What happened here?
-LIAM-
-- so that nothing charges in on us.
-MATT-
You got it.
-LAURA-
Any clues how to defeat it? Which way is Ludinus?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, where's Ludinus? What were they looking for?
-TALIESIN-
What happened? What were they looking for?
-LAURA-
Yeah, all right.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Do you want to ask about Dominox at all?
-LAURA-
Mm. (I don't know) All right.
-MATT-
So you invoke the charm and you watch as the finger bone that sits in the middle of the bracelet turns a quarter within the bracelet, like a-- (sharp crack)
-LAURA-
Ugh, I don't like it.
-MATT-
As it does, you feel this wave of cold energy pass through your hands, and the corpse before you, the hanging head goes, "(dry rasp)" You can now see the somewhat tangled, short, blondish hair of this older man balding in the front.
The eyes peek up towards you and through you, bloodshot beneath.
You can see the blood trickling from the nose and the mouth as it looks up, the tongue lolling, and its slack jaw as it glares at you.
"(dry rasp)" Essek glides back about a foot, (laughs) and starts looking at all sides of the room, following in your scent and has his hands up, ready to cast whatever's needed.
"(dry rasp)"
-LAURA-
What is the creature that did this to you?
-MATT-
"He just called himself Dominox."
-LAURA-
Shit, that was a dumb question.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"(dry rasp)"
-LAURA-
I wanted more details.
-MATT-
"The whispers in--"
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
The whisper what?
-MATT-
"The whispers in our head."
-MARISHA-
"Whispers in our head."
-LAURA-
That didn't count as another question.
-ASHLEY-
The whispers in our head?
-TRAVIS-
You didn't ask one, he just told you.
-MATT-
No, he just gave information.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
"The whispers in our head."
-LIAM-
Haggle with the dead.
-LAURA-
(laughs) I know.
-MARISHA-
Five.
-ROBBIE-
Five?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
Do you have any clues how to avoid or defeat him?
-MATT-
"No.
We were told to hold the chamber, and then Raah Cosen lifted me on this hook, and I bled out. (grunts)"
-LAURA-
Which way did Ludinus go?
-MATT-
"Ludinus? I did not see Ludinus."
-LAURA-
Where are the chambers that you were searching in?
-MATT-
"All through these halls."
-LAURA-
Fuck.
-ROBBIE-
Is this the last one?
-LAURA-
Yeah. You guys got anything else?
-TRAVIS-
What does Dominox do? What does he do to you?
-TALIESIN-
What was the whispers?
-LIAM-
What is it? What is Dominox?
-LAURA-
I don't know if he knows.
He just said, "The whispers in our head."
-MARISHA-
We know it's a fiend, we know it whispers in our head, we know it probably has some sort of anti-magic situation.
-TALIESIN-
Did you touch the chains? I don't know, I'm curious if the chains are a problem or which passage--
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
-- would be the best to take?
-LAURA-
Did you do anything to cause the chains to find you?
-MATT-
"I think this started with the engine room."
-LAURA-
The engine room.
-MATT-
"(rasps)"
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
My questions sucked, y'all.
-MARISHA-
Well--
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no, no.
-MARISHA-
-- we already knew a lot.
-TALIESIN-
The questions were great, it was the answers that sucked.
-LIAM-
Does that viscera trail go through one of these specific passages of the three?
-MATT-
The viscera trail ends in this chamber.
-LIAM-
Ends.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The chains must have come out and sucked it, or one of the smiley people.
I could ask a smiley person, they might have more information about what Dominox is.
-TRAVIS-
Hey, Fearne, your guy with the little mark on your hand, was he a devil or a demon?
-LIAM-
He was a devil guy, right?
-ASHLEY-
That was a--
-LIAM-
He was fancy.
-MATT-
Devil.
-ASHLEY-
De-vil.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Both of us at the same time, go.
-MATT-
Dev-ahn.
-LAURA-
Sermon Terts.
-ASHLEY-
Teven? I mean, I could try to reach out.
-TRAVIS-
Just saying.
-ASHLEY-
I can try to reach out.
I'm going to cast Mage Hand.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
One of the bodies that's up close, I'm going to try to open up their clothing to see if there's any rune on their chest.
-MATT-
The one that's closest to all of you as you enter is the one that you first looked at, the female that's dangling forward.
Do you want to go to that one or one that's off to the side?
-LAURA-
Probably the smiling one.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Yeah, a smiley one.
-MATT-
Okay.
So as the hook has put in through
-ASHLEY-
Hope it doesn't just wake something up.
-MATT-
-- the shoulder blade and underneath, you pull open the Vanguard robes a little bit and you can see where the hook is piercing through the front.
As you pull back the cloth and there's the red-stained skin around it and that bit of decay that's starting to slightly come in, the signs of early bloat.
The decay here is slow for a number of reasons.
These bodies, these all look like they're fresher than they should be if this has been happening for even more than a week.
But you do see the signs of carving, skin drawn in a familiar looking top of a symbol.
skin drawn in a familiar looking top of a symbol.
-MARISHA-
Imogen.
-LAURA-
Hmm?
-ASHLEY-
Button it back up.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, right.
-MARISHA-
I know you took it off.
-LAURA-
No, that shit's back on.
-MARISHA-
Did you put it back on? All right.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
I put that back on when we got here.
-MARISHA-
Someone needs to make sure that it doesn't get in your head.
-LAURA-
I did that on our first short break. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
Yeah, good, good.
-ASHLEY-
Should I reach out to--?
-TALIESIN-
I don't trust that kid.
-LAURA-
Well, no, but I mean--
-TALIESIN-
We are in a very precarious place, I don't know.
-MARISHA-
I'm actually here for it.
-LAURA-
Maybe wait for it to get a little, well, yeah, that's up to you.
-ASHLEY-
Maybe give a little, because the thing is, if we wait--
-MARISHA-
It might be too late.
-ASHLEY-
-- it might take them a little bit too long.
-LAURA-
That's true.
-MARISHA-
I know.
-LAURA-
She's got a devil prince guy that has the hots for her.
-MARISHA-
She's got a boyfriend.
-ROBBIE-
Of course.
-ASHLEY-
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
I don't know how to--
-LIAM-
Ships passing in the night.
-TALIESIN-
He's a vibe.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to try something, okay?
-LAURA-
Sure.
-ASHLEY-
I go to where the kiss was on the hand.
Yeah.
Hello? Then I'll kiss the kiss.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
You kiss the kiss?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As you kiss the kiss, (flame roars) the finger alights in flame and the symbol burns its way into the top of your finger.
-LAURA-
Oh shit!
-MATT-
It doesn't hurt you, but the rest of you see this glowing lamp light from outside of her hand.
-ASHLEY-
I try to just hide it because it's really bright.
-MATT-
She hides it and it's just getting brighter and brighter.
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Oh.
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-LAURA-
Well?
-ROBBIE-
Well, what is that?
-ASHLEY-
Hello? Hello?
-MATT-
As you pull it up you watch as a spark, a small flame spark (flame leaps) arcs out from the finger.
As it the hits middle of the air, (flames crackle and roar) it tears open into this three-foot oval of burning flame.
You watch as a heavy foot--
-LAURA-
Yes!
-MATT-
-- steps out.
You see this terrifying looking humanoid You see this terrifying looking humanoid with deep red skin, a massive mane of dark gray long hair and a bushy beard, yellow eyes, massive horns, armored shoulders, clutching on the back a two-handed sword that is sheathed.
As it clomps through, the tail following behind.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god, hi!
-MATT-
"You called me."
-ASHLEY-
You got here so fast.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I thought it was going to take--
-MATT-
"I told you--"
-ASHLEY-
-- way longer than that.
-MATT-
"-- I'd come when you called."
-LAURA-
Wow.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-MATT-
"The pact begins."
-LAURA-
Oh, that's right, it came with a thing.
-MATT-
"What do you require?"
-LAURA-
Do you remember what the pact was?
-MATT-
Essek goes, "Will someone--"
-TRAVIS-
Who cares? (laughter)
-MATT-
"Would someone like to explain what the hell is going on, literally?"
-LAURA-
She has a pact.
-ASHLEY-
It's a pact.
-MATT-
"Great."
-ASHLEY-
It's just, I don't really understand it, but we'll figure it out.
He can help us out.
-MATT-
"This is a friend of yours."
-ASHLEY-
Teven, this is Essek.
Essek, Teven.
-LIAM-
Fearne collects a lot of pets and boyfriends.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
"Teven--"
-ASHLEY-
Dorian, Teven.
-MATT-
The literal devil creature looks to each of you and gives a nod to Essek, looks back to you.
-LAURA-
Do you know anything about Dominox?
-MATT-
(Teven) "Dominox.
Not a name that's been uttered in a long time."
-ROBBIE-
Oh, he knows! He know!
-TALIESIN-
We just heard it about two minutes ago.
-MARISHA-
He said uttered in a long time?
-TRAVIS-
It's that old shit.
That's that old guard! Let's go, old beastie!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking crack it open, Mercer!
-TALIESIN-
So that name--
-ROBBIE-
With a name like Dominox it's got to be good!
-TALIESIN-
-- got heard about two minutes ago.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
You know it's fresh.
-TALIESIN-
Good timing.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"There have been a number of grand demons through history."
-LIAM-
Demons.
-TRAVIS-
Grand demons?
-LAURA-
Devils.
-LIAM-
Grand demons.
-MATT-
"One of our great enemies in the ancient times."
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah.
-MARISHA-
Great enemies!
-LIAM-
Devils vs. demons!
-MATT-
"We wanted to feel his ruin upon our blades, but he was not seen through the Calamity."
-LAURA-
Wow.
-MATT-
"We fear he was lost."
-ASHLEY-
Wait, not seen through the what?
-TRAVIS-
Calamity.
-ASHLEY-
Calamity?
-LAURA-
Guess who's here?
-ASHLEY-
That's what I thought he said.
-MARISHA-
Look around, look around. Look behind you.
-ASHLEY-
I think he's been taking up residence here.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, smell that shit.
-TALIESIN-
Weird-ass chains.
Symbols on people's chest, big grins, whispers.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Look at the--
-MATT-
"There is ruin in this air tonight."
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
"Great."
-TALIESIN-
He's a bit turned on--
-MATT-
"Great."
-TALIESIN-
-- it makes me like him.
-MARISHA-
You said you devils have a long standing grudge? Do you have any bros you can call up? It might be now! Now is a great time.
-MATT-
"There is a bit going on." (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
No, no! We're grateful for you. For you!
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, we're not undervaluing your presence here.
-LAURA-
Mm-mm.
-MATT-
"Many are preparing for the coming attacks on the red moon of destruction.
Our great prince does not want such things to befall our Hells."
-ASHLEY-
The Great Prince.
-MATT-
"So, I will be with you for a time until I'm called away.
But to bring back the head of a grand demon is quite the task." You see for a second that hunter's joy--
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
-- shift into reality and that confidence becomes calculation.
"There are a few types of demons beneath the lords.
The grands are dangerous.
The Grand Demon of Loathing has quite a mythology.
The Grand Demon of Loathing has quite a mythology.
Why would it be here now?"
-ASHLEY-
I don't, I don't know.
-LAURA-
Somebody said as soon as they disturbed the ancient rooms, they're digging up old tech.
-MARISHA-
If you haven't heard of him since the Calamity, maybe the Aeorians had actually sealed him away and when they started busting into the rooms?
-LAURA-
That is quite possible.
-LIAM-
Right, magic is hinky the world over, so maybe extra hinky here.
-MARISHA-
Yes, that's right.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to Mage Hand again to the rune on the chest, just so he can get a look at it.
-MATT-
"Ah.
That is his sigil.
That is the carving of gifting.
Those who offer in their final moments Those who offer in their final moments what he desires, their oblivion." He holds the blade strong under his grip.
"I do not know where we are."
-TRAVIS-
Essek, fill him in.
(laughter)
-MATT-
(Essek) "Hello.
Essek, strange companion to these strangers.
Yes, ancient city of Aeor, mageocracy destroyed during the Calamity.
You've see many of the ancient bodies here from those individuals, and these on the hooks are fresher.
Where do I go from there?" He floats back a little bit, a little overwhelmed and looking over towards, still looking at you like: What the fuck did you just do?
-LAURA-
You have a pact to Asmodeus now.
-ASHLEY-
I have a pact to Asmodeus now, because now I have--
-MATT-
"This is a frying pan into frying pan circumstance, perhaps?"
-TALIESIN-
Eh, don't really know.
-TRAVIS-
There's a chance he could be working with a member of the Cerberus Assembly.
There's a chance that Ludinus could have unlocked an ancient prison.
Maybe he was up on the moon and released and brought him down as a diversion or a distraction.
-TALIESIN-
Ludinus is a big deal.
-TRAVIS-
There's any number of things.
But if we can find this Dominox, we can find Ludinus.
If we find Ludinus, we can try to stop what's happening on that moon of destruction.
-MARISHA-
Well remember, Ludinus came here to deal with Dominox.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
He's killing all the Vanguard.
Not to throw a little wrenchy wrench into this plan, Not to throw a little wrenchy wrench into this plan, because I love this plan, but right now Dominox is distracting Ludinus.
but right now Dominox is distracting Ludinus.
-TRAVIS-
We think.
-MARISHA-
We think.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
And weakening Ludinus potentially.
-MARISHA-
Right.
-TRAVIS-
We think.
-MARISHA-
Our goal here was to try and thwart Ludinus in some way.
So how can we maybe use Dominox to our advantage?
-TRAVIS-
The grand demon that hasn't been around since the Calamity? We're going to <i>use</i> him?
-MARISHA-
I'm not saying we're going to use, I'm just saying that we--
-ASHLEY-
That's be tight.
-ROBBIE-
I'm pretty good at making friends.
-LIAM-
I understand. I'm with you.
-MARISHA-
You get what I'm trying to lay down?
-LIAM-
Can we throw Ludinus--
-LAURA-
You are very charming.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, I think so.
-LIAM-
-- under the demonic bus before getting the fuck out?
-MARISHA-
I just don't know if killing Dominox is maybe the way right now.
-LAURA-
Well, you know, let's just, let's get into these ruins and see what the fuck's happening.
-LIAM-
One step at a time.
-TALIESIN-
I love making friends.
-MATT-
(Essek) "Do we know which room to go into? What--"
-TALIESIN-
Sentient summon out of an engine room.
-LIAM-
Orym looks around this room and its like, sci-fi, ancient future city, dunamancy wizard, devil prince, Bells Hells, and is just under his breath like: Metal.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I'll go over to the first door on the right, look for any sort of lettering and also check it for traps.
-ASHLEY-
(scampering)
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Engines create heat--
-MATT-
Roll an investigation check.
-TALIESIN-
-- make sound.
They said they turned it on.
-LAURA-
He's a hybrid.
He's a wolf right now.
-TRAVIS-
21.
-ROBBIE-
Should we befriend him?
-LAURA-
He's a wolf.
-MATT-
21.
The door is not locked, it is closed, and is not trapped.
Could you make a wisdom saving throw for me, please?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Which, yeah, because which door was Pâté in front of when he dropped?
-MATT-
I think he was in the center of the chamber.
-TRAVIS-
17.
-LAURA-
Oh, fuck.
-MATT-
17.
-ASHLEY-
So maybe--
-MATT-
Chetney, you turn to look at the group--
-ASHLEY-
Maybe we go around all of this.
-MATT-
-- and you don't see <i>them</i> in the room.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Oh fuck.
-MATT-
You see--
-ASHLEY-
What did he roll?
-MATT-
-- dozens of children.
Children that step towards you and reveal the bloody claw marks across their body, their throats, their eyes.
One steps up.
(child) "What have you done? Have you forgotten the terrible things you've done, Chetney?" Another child comes from the other corner.
"You don't even remember.
You're the bad wolf, you're the big bad wolf." Another one, "You made us toys, you filled us with joy, and we filled your belly, and you told no one." A little girl comes up and grabs your hand.
"You think you are not a monster now? How many did you kill? How many more will join us still?"
-TRAVIS-
What? What the fuck?
-MATT-
They all slowly step towards you.
-ASHLEY-
Chet?
-TRAVIS-
I start backing up, put my back against the wall, and moving.
Where-- You guys?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah?
-ASHLEY-
It's okay.
-TRAVIS-
(frantic) You guys!
-LIAM-
Do we hear this?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, is he doing this?
-MATT-
You hear <i>him</i> saying this.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-LIAM-
That's what I mean.
That's what I mean, he's freaking out by a door?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
What's wrong? What's wrong?
-TALIESIN-
Going senile? What's up?
-LIAM-
Chet, can you hear me? Can you hear us?
-TALIESIN-
Chet?
-MATT-
They're nowhere to be found.
-ROBBIE-
No, no.
We lost all the rest.
-ASHLEY-
Oh no, he's--
-LAURA-
He's out?
-TALIESIN-
Wood's stupid and it breaks.
-LAURA-
I don't know if this works.
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit.
-ASHLEY-
I have an above-- I have a question.
-MATT-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
So in that open chamber, it's doors, not hallways?
-MATT-
There are different exits to this room, hallways that come together, but the entryways are closed.
-ASHLEY-
Got it, got it, got it, got it. Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
Okay, I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming.
(panicked groans) Can I turn around to the door that I was just checking for traps? (grunts) I'll push the door open.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
He can't see us at all, he only sees kids?
-LIAM-
Just slashed children.
-MATT-
You go to turn towards the door to push it open and there's this little four year old girl--
-LAURA-
(gags)
-MATT-
-- with two pigtails that are tied in the center.
You see this horrible claw across her face with the eyes missing.
She holds this tiny broken wooden toy of immaculate craftsmanship and she goes, "Why?" (static buzzes) You see flashes of mid forest, hunger, bloodlust, a scream and a swipe.
And you're back.
Did you do that?
-LAURA-
(gasps) He didn't do that.
-MARISHA-
He didn't do that.
-LAURA-
He didn't do that.
-ASHLEY-
He did that.
-LAURA-
No, he didn't.
-MATT-
I mean, there were periods of time that you lost when you were first infected, you were feral.
You don't remember much about that time.
You look at her and stop before that door and step back and you feel one of the other kids and you turn and look and you see this young little elf boy looking at you with this, this pity, his throat missing, just this mess.
You see, leaping over a fence post in a dense forest, you grab a sheep and tear into it.
You see a little kid holding out a lantern go, "Mom, I heard something." You lunge back there in front.
You recognize him.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-LAURA-
How do we break this?
-MATT-
No.
-TRAVIS-
(bewildered mumbling) I don't know, fuck.
How many kids are in this fucking room?
-MATT-
Right now, you see about 13 of them.
-TRAVIS-
(panting) Guys! Guys, there's, there's, there's kids!
-LAURA-
I'm going to try to, I don't know if it'll work, cast Calm Emotions on him.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
It can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened.
I don't know if that'll work.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Can we hear him screaming?
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
You can you hear him screaming.
-TRAVIS-
I am a werewolf, so it be like: (growling scream)
-MATT-
Yeah. (laughs) Make a wisdom check with disadvantage for me, please.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I'm getting closer to Chet, too.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, we lost our temp hit points.
-TRAVIS-
Four.
-MATT-
Four.
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Can I send a message to Chetney?
-MATT-
Sure.
-MARISHA-
Try with the intent of maybe getting in his head and pushing out whatever's in there.
I say: Chetney, this isn't real.
You have to wake up.
-MATT-
You don't hear anything.
-MARISHA-
Fuck.
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
-MATT-
You calm a minute, your breath calms, and you look down at the kids, and they're coming up to you.
They're not aggressive, they're just sorrowful.
They look at you sad, they look at you confused.
You look down at another young dwarven child that goes, "Why?"
-TRAVIS-
I didn't, I didn't do this.
This, this wasn't me.
This isn't real, this isn't real.
I didn't, I don't remember any of this!
-MATT-
(flashes) You glance past the faces and see moments of each of them being pulled down, pulled apart, grabbed, crushed.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-MATT-
These moments, and you were there.
You look up at your hands and around you and the chains are gone, just dark trees.
A deep, dense forest that surrounds you and the children.
You see the blood on your claws.
-LIAM-
I'm resting my hand on his shoulder in the room.
Chet--
-TALIESIN-
You've walked that far?
-LIAM-
Yeah, Chet--
-MATT-
You feel this blade begin to dig into your shoulder.
-LIAM-
Chet.
-MATT-
What do you do?
-TRAVIS-
A blade?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I swipe at it.
-LIAM-
You're okay.
-MATT-
Make an attack roll for me.
-LAURA-
He would only be at his hip.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm reaching up to his Popeye werewolf chest.
-TRAVIS-
28.
-LIAM-
28?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, natural 18 plus 10.
Unarmed strike, right?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You swipe back and (swipes).
Roll claw damage as Chetney rakes you across the the neck with the armor, catches some of it, but some of it also goes across the meat of your shoulder.
-TRAVIS-
Eight points of damage.
-LIAM-
Eight points, okay.
I'm going to shove him up against the stone wall and try to press up against him and yell: Chetney!
-MATT-
The kids begin to swarm you and push you up against one of the trees, they're leaping onto you.
-LIAM-
Come on, old man.
-MATT-
They go, "Why, why, why, why?" They're climbing up your chest and looking in your face with their vacant eyes, their vacant sockets.
-TRAVIS-
No, it's okay, I can make it right! I-I-I can make it right! I didn't do any of this!
-MATT-
You open your eyes and it's Orym holding you against the wall.
You're in the shadowed space of the room.
-LIAM-
Ease down.
Ease down, Pock O'Pea, come on.
-TRAVIS-
Did you see, did you see the kids? Did you see the kids and the--?
-LIAM-
It's just, it's just us, Chet.
-TRAVIS-
Spinning around, spinning around.
-LIAM-
Take a second, take a second, breathe.
-MATT-
No children, just the dangling bodies.
-TRAVIS-
Oh god, there were, there were children.
Opened up, torn apart.
They-they were talking to me like I had done it, but I don't remember.
But I saw it like I had.
-LIAM-
Take a minute, think about it.
Think about where we are, think about what we're dealing with.
Chet, think about it.
-TRAVIS-
Oh god.
Whatever you say, it was in my head.
It was so real.
It was <i>so</i> real.
-MARISHA-
Why don't we take a minute to get out of here and regroup for a second? Maybe you need inspirational words.
-ROBBIE-
Yes, I can take a hint.
-MARISHA-
Yes, yes. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Okay, everyone, that was scary, it was very scary.
-LAURA-
It happened when you touched the doors?
-TRAVIS-
I think so.
-ASHLEY-
Or just gone in the vicinity of him?
-LIAM-
I look into his wolven eyes.
Does he look, he's lucid now?
-LAURA-
Do you have anything that--
-MATT-
He looks more, he's engaging you--
-LAURA-
-- gives advantage on wisdom saves?
-MATT-
-- and not attacking and seems to be looking around.
-ROBBIE-
It takes a minute.
-MATT-
Seems to be a little more lucid.
-ROBBIE-
So I'm doing it.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay. Yeah.
We got to do it.
-MARISHA-
We got to do it.
-ROBBIE-
We're doing it.
Yeah, we're doing it.
-MARISHA-
You're blocked by people getting in your head more or less?
-LAURA-
Let me double check on this inventory.
-TALIESIN-
I'm a big problem.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Me too.
-TALIESIN-
Barbarians and fighters are big problems.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yup.
-LAURA-
Immune to--
-ASHLEY-
Been there.
-LAURA-
-- magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts or determine that I'm lying.
(uncertain) Mm.
-TRAVIS-
Can I look at my shoulder, where I felt the blade was?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
Anything?
-MATT-
No blade.
-LAURA-
I don't know if--
-TRAVIS-
No wound?
-MATT-
No wound.
-LAURA-
-- I'm blocked against it.
They can't perceive me and they can't lie to me or tell that I'm lying, but I think he might still be able to get in there.
-MARISHA-
He can still sway you.
Okay.
-LIAM-
I can jump really high, so I think I'm going to be fine.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
And hey, maybe we haven't had the best of luck up until this time.
And the droning continues.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I look over at the devil in the room.
What was that? You have to know what that was.
I saw things that weren't there.
I wasn't even here!
-MATT-
"(scoffs) Maybe you are not prepared for what you're fighting."
-LAURA-
No, no, we're definitely not.
-TALIESIN-
That's why you're here. Literally.
-ASHLEY-
Do you have anything you can tell us, what was that? What do we, what do we-- what do we do?
-MATT-
Points to the bodies in the chains.
"Do better than they did."
-ASHLEY-
(sarcastically) Oh, thank you so much.
-TRAVIS-
I don't like that.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, he's so hot.
-LAURA-
Does getting damage break it?
-MARISHA-
I don't know.
I was honestly afraid to do anything to hit Chetney because I didn't want him to--
-LAURA-
Attack.
-MARISHA-
-- attack.
-TRAVIS-
How does his magic presence, loathing, work? Does that mean he's nearby?
-MATT-
"He was before my time, I do not know."
-TRAVIS-
Before your time!
-MARISHA-
Whoa!
-MATT-
"I am centuries old, but Dominox is a myth in the lands of Hell I come from."
-LAURA-
We could ask one of these ancient guys then.
We could ask one of the bodies from the Calamity.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That's true.
-TALIESIN-
Aren't we out of--
-MATT-
Are you all slowly pulling back into the hallway?
-ROBBIE-
And we have the power of friendship, which is why we'll win! And that should be about a minute.
(laughter)
That's a Motivational Speech.
Yeah, yeah, so I'm going to cast at a lower level, 3rd-level.
So you get five temp hit points.
-LAURA-
How many, there are more than five us, though?
-ROBBIE-
I can only do five people.
-LAURA-
If you do it at a higher level do you get more people?
-ROBBIE-
No.
-TALIESIN-
It's the wisdom save though, so.
-LIAM-
It's a wisdom save?
-ROBBIE-
It is.
-LIAM-
Give it to the fighter and the barbarian.
-TALIESIN-
Yep, give it to the fighter and the barbarian.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Chet already got dinged, sorry.
-TRAVIS-
No problem.
-LAURA-
I got bad wisdom.
-ROBBIE-
One, two, three, four, and not for myself.
-ASHLEY-
My wisdom's okay, so if anybody else needs to take it.
-MARISHA-
Her wisdom is okay, how is your wisdom?
-ROBBIE-
Uh, pfft!
-MARISHA-
Maybe you should do--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, just take it yourself.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, I'll take it myself.
-LIAM-
What's your mod? Are you a plus what? Dor?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, you mean for saves or just the mod?
-LIAM-
For saves.
-ROBBIE-
Negative one.
-LIAM-
Negative one?
-LAURA-
Take that shit!
-ROBBIE-
What?
-LIAM-
Take it.
-ASHLEY-
Take it.
-ROBBIE-
Fine.
-TALIESIN-
That's one, two, three, four, five, we're good.
-ROBBIE-
Five and you guys are good?
-ASHLEY-
Well, I'm okay, you don't need to put it on me.
So am I taking the--
-MARISHA-
Pick someone other than--
-TALIESIN-
Us three.
-ROBBIE-
Three, four, five.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Wisdom?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, but maybe do him.
-ASHLEY-
Those temporary hit points are gone?
-TALIESIN-
He's already been hit, though.
-TRAVIS-
I get it?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
He's already been hit, you think he'll not maybe get--
-LIAM-
I retract, I think I'm better than I thought the rest of the group.
I thought I was worse than the group, but I think I'm a little better than the group.
-TRAVIS-
It's advantage on wisdom saves, right?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, and some other stuff.
-TRAVIS-
I'll take it.
-LAURA-
You're looking at our numbers like, "oh shit, you guys suck."
-ROBBIE-
So you get five temp hit points and then if you take a hit on your next turn you get advantage on your attack roll.
-LAURA-
Okay, great.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that's--
-MARISHA-
So you're going to sit out too because you're good?
-LIAM-
I'm going to sit it out.
-MARISHA-
Then Fearne is going to sit out.
So, one, two, three, four--
-TALIESIN-
I get advantage on my attack roll--
-MARISHA-
-- five.
-TALIESIN-
-- if I get hit?
-LIAM-
I'm sure I'll catch the whammy, but.
-LAURA-
You're wise.
-TALIESIN-
That's a bad idea. Shit.
-ASHLEY-
So, I'm not even taking temporary hit points as well.
-MATT-
(Essek) "Am I not getting--"
-LAURA-
Are you wise, though, I don't know.
-TALIESIN-
I was going to say advantage on my attack roll is-- I'm going to side.
-MATT-
"I consider myself quite experienced, yes."
-TRAVIS-
Maybe Essek, instead.
-TALIESIN-
Essek instead of.
-ROBBIE-
Essek?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Does he have high wisdom or?
-TRAVIS-
I don't know.
-MATT-
You don't know.
-TALIESIN-
We're not getting--
-LAURA-
But if he gets taken over--
-ROBBIE-
So, who's feeling inspired?
-LAURA-
If he gets taken over, he could Fuck. Us. Up.
-ROBBIE-
Hey.
-MARISHA-
So maybe, okay.
Well, and this thing is also attracted to magic, it seems like, so maybe it is better.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
One, two, three, four.
Who else? Oh, and Chetney.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Right?
-TALIESIN-
You two, you two and--
-MARISHA-
There's one, two, three, four, five.
Okay, okay.
-LIAM-
Honestly, you witches could do a lot more damage than I could if I were.
-LAURA-
I mean, who knows, who knows.
-TALIESIN-
You hold me in one place and I'm not, you know, that's the--
-MATT-
So... On Essek?
-ROBBIE-
Who is it? I can track the boons if I know who we landed on.
Raise your hand.
If you got motivated by my killer speech.
-MARISHA-
Chetney, too.
-TRAVIS-
Can I place my hand on the floor and try for a Grim Psychometry roll?
-TALIESIN-
I wasn't listening.
-ROBBIE-
I'm work shopping it!
-TALIESIN-
I kind of phased it out.
-MATT-
Yeah, make a history check for me.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah? Okay.
-LAURA-
Can I talk to--
-TALIESIN-
This stuff is kind of derivative, man.
-LAURA-
-- another dead body?
-MATT-
Sure, which one you want to try and go for?
-LAURA-
Should I do it?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Let's talk to Ancient McAncientson.
-LIAM-
We did a newbie, so--
-ASHLEY-
Oldie oldie.
-LIAM-
Golden oldie, yeah.
-LAURA-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Natural 19.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Is this Grim Psychometry?
-TRAVIS-
Plus three, 22.
-MATT-
22, okay.
-ASHLEY-
History check, I think.
-TRAVIS-
It's just the room. I put my hand on the floor of the room.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-MATT-
This space is filled with a <i>lot</i> of negative energy and the fiendish presence here almost becomes too much to sift through.
It's like the dark memory is a mist so thick that you just see shapes through it.
You see shapes of people screaming, being carried, and being thrown on hooks by other people.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-MATT-
People touching their face and then finding another.
Before eventually pulling the hook down and putting themselves on it.
-ROBBIE-
Nah. Come on.
-LAURA-
So the hooks aren't grabbing people, it's other--
-MARISHA-
They do it willingly.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, the hooks have to be summoned from somewhere.
-ROBBIE-
Does it look like the chains are going anywhere? Like a pipeline? Like they're feeding into anything?
-MATT-
They look flush with the stone.
There's no--
-ROBBIE-
So even the ones on the ground aren't leading anywhere particularly?
-MATT-
You can follow it if you'd like to start.
You can make an investigation check.
-TRAVIS-
I know there's no pushing through these visions in a certain way, but is there any presence that's not a person that is ending up on a hook? Any other entity that's moving through?
-MATT-
Unfortunately, there is so much--
-LAURA-
It's gone.
-TRAVIS-
Stank in here? (laughs)
-MATT-
-- abyssal energy in this space, and so much negativity, here in the core of the city of Aeor.
Here in the core of this recent thing, it's flooding you with so much dark history that it's just oppressive and blurred.
You see and hear screams, hundreds of screams.
You hear explosions.
You hear people yelling in a language you don't understand.
In the middle of people being hoisted upon chains.
Everything's kind of blurring together.
It's too much and you can't make out a lot.
-TRAVIS-
I got it.
-MATT-
In this instance you would have needed a natural 20 to pick up more than what you got.
-LAURA-
Wow!
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I got it.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
This is a mish-mash of history.
-TRAVIS-
A grand demon? Yeah, I--
-ROBBIE-
I hit a 16 on my investigation.
I want to look for what fucked Chet up.
Like, as my instincts.
Like what triggered this? So I'm going to see if I can kind of--
-TRAVIS-
Did I get a hand on the door or was it before I got to it?
-MATT-
Before you got to the door.
-TRAVIS-
Before I got to the door, okay.
-MATT-
You begin to follow the chains along the ground and you can see a lot of them are connected to nothing.
They're just laying there in long 50-, 100 plus-foot spindles.
Like sleeping serpents.
Either they were just left there or carried or apparated.
It's odd.
They don't seem to snake out into other walls.
They're just kind of present.
While you're checking there, you said, who's doing what?
-LAURA-
Oh, I was going to talk to one of the dead Aeorians.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay, I'll do that.
I'll go over to one of the bodies.
-MATT-
Okay, this is the last use of that charm.
-LAURA-
Yes.
For the day.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Underneath the numerous chains that are wrapped over the armored torso of the nearest one that you've noticed, the skeletal body, the faint wisps of white hair that cling to the barely skin covered skull, the sunken sockets.
It's reminiscent of the face of that woman from the "Scary Stories to Tell in Dark" image.
-ASHLEY-
Oh yes!
-MATT-
Just on the side and with a chain resting over the head.
You trigger the charm a second time.
The finger bone spins once more and it locks into place.
As it does, the same cold energy sifts through and you hear the chain begin to (light clicks) As the body shifts slightly towards you and the head kind of, "(gasps)" Looks up in your way.
The sucking sound of air into no lungs, magically held for some sort of speech.
What do you want to ask?
-LAURA-
Dominox has been released.
How was he captured?
-MATT-
"The-- Pinion of Service."
-LAURA-
Pinion of Service?
-LIAM-
Pinion of Service.
-LAURA-
Is he still talking?
-MATT-
He's still just waiting.
-LAURA-
What is the Pinion of Service?
-MATT-
"An Abyssal soul anchor."
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
"Developed to contain shadow magics.
It keeps him shackled to the engine."
-LAURA-
The engine.
-MATT-
"And he returns to it when slain by the engine's extraction process." "when slain by the engine's extraction process."
-TRAVIS-
Holy shit.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
They were using him to power the fucking engine.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-LIAM-
A mega demon.
As an engine?
-LAURA-
Where is this engine?
-MATT-
"(deep exhale)" One of the skeletal hand reaches up from the chains.
It's having a hard time at first, from the weight of them, before the arm points to the door opposite that you almost pushed through.
-TALIESIN-
How do we find him?
-LAURA-
How do you turn the engine on?
-MATT-
"The-- Engine should be on.
The seals should be-- Kept.
If the seals remain, he should be harmless."
-LAURA-
So we need to reinstate those seals.
-MARISHA-
The seals got turned off when the magic got wonky.
-TRAVIS-
That's a hell of a gerbil to stick in your--
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
-- Pre-Calamity flying city.
-LIAM-
Just a rod of plutonium in my microwave.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Wowsers.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck, that's--
-MATT-
Age of Arcanum, man.
-LAURA-
What are Dominox's-- Do you know of any weaknesses he has?
-MATT-
"Demons, when slain, return to the Abyss.
When killed in the Abyss, they are killed forever.
When killed in the Abyss, they are killed forever.
But the Pinion is of the Abyss.
And to it he'll return to forever run the engine."
-LAURA-
Got it.
Was that my last question?
-TALIESIN-
Ah fuck.
-LIAM-
I think it was four.
-MARISHA-
It was.
-LAURA-
Do we got any more for him?
-TALIESIN-
Why is, I want to know how this, I don't even know what to say.
How this room works.
But what is it about this room that triggers the effect? Like, I don't know.
-LAURA-
I think he's just gotten released, the seal's broken, he's out.
-LIAM-
Maybe Dominox is fucking with us.
-LAURA-
What is Dominox attracted to?
-MATT-
"Dominox-- Feeds on insecurity."
-MARISHA-
Oh god.
-TALIESIN-
We're fucked.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I will go talk to him, it's fine.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Fearne has this covered.
-ASHLEY-
I got this covered.
-TALIESIN-
I, for one, welcome our new demonic master.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
We're fucked.
-MATT-
"It introduces the suffering of self loathing."
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
"Until you present yourself to oblivion.
And he feeds."
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-LAURA-
Cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
"(gasping)"
-MARISHA-
So.
-TRAVIS-
Good questions.
-MARISHA-
My crazy out of Laudna, out of left field, there's a demon possessing the machine, is right? That's insane! That was a joke!
-MATT-
Dorian, roll a wisdom saving throw for me.
-ALL-
No!
-ROBBIE-
Why?!
-TRAVIS-
Here we go, here we go! Here we go, here we go now! Hey, batter!
-ROBBIE-
Save with a negative one.
Hey, that's a-- Hmm-mm! That's a two!
-MARISHA-
Come on, come on, bigger.
-ROBBIE-
Please do good!
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh!
-ROBBIE-
Okay. 16.
-MATT-
16.
-TRAVIS-
Grand demon.
-LAURA-
Nope, nope.
-TRAVIS-
Grand demon.
-MATT-
As they're having this conversation and you're sitting at the edge of the hallway, after following the chains and looking around and throwing in information as you can.
You go towards the center left side of the chamber.
Where no one has really gone to yet.
You look up at one of the bodies on the hook and you see beyond the soiled pants, the dangling arm of blue skin.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-TALIESIN-
Mm!
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You see the open travel robe and the hook that pierces the sternum of a familiar, strong torso.
You see there dangling from it, eyes lifeless and still, the body of your brother Cyrus.
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-MATT-
As the eyes shift to meet yours.
"You never let me fix my own mistakes, instead, pulling me into yours.
Into your chaos.
Look where it put me.
Look what you did to me, brother." And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode.
(groaning)
-TALIESIN-
No!
-ASHLEY-
No!
-ROBBIE-
Oh, come on!
-ASHLEY-
No!
-TRAVIS-
Shit, Matt!
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit!
-TALIESIN-
It's going to be easy!
-TRAVIS-
Grand demon!
-TALIESIN-
Chet was going to get him.
I was going to get to beat a werewolf.
-LAURA-
Cruelty is always needless.
-TALIESIN-
But no, we're going here.
-TRAVIS-
Grand demon! Oh no!
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
Insecurity, but okay, no, I'm stopping.
-ROBBIE-
Cool.
-LAURA-
Cry until we play again.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
I figured that would be a good place to pick up our live show at the Greek, right? (exclaiming)
-LIAM-
Jeez! Jeez!
-TALIESIN-
What?
-ROBBIE-
Oh, come on!
-ASHLEY-
Wait!
-MARISHA-
We're going to be dealing with demon shit at the Greek.
-ROBBIE-
Oh yeah.
-ASHLEY-
We're playing, oh.
-LAURA-
Oh! (gasps)
-ROBBIE-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh!
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Wow.
-TRAVIS-
Oh fudge!
-TALIESIN-
No!
-LAURA-
Next episode is at the Greek.
-MARISHA-
Next session is the Greek.
-TRAVIS-
Grand demon!
-MATT-
So we'll pick up on that beat and where you are and what's around you and what all this might mean, and what's the Ludinus of it all here--
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-MATT-
-- at the Greek Theater.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-TALIESIN-
We die at the palace.
-LIAM-
Get your tickets--
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god!
-LIAM-
-- right now, ladies and gentlemen.
-MATT-
For those of you who we'll see there in person, excited to explore this next step, and for those of you who can't be there, you'll be able to enjoy that shortly thereafter.
But yeah, this will be fun.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-LAURA-
Are we all going to die at the Greek?
-ROBBIE-
It's live--
-MARISHA-
TPK!
-ROBBIE-
-- what could go wrong?
-TRAVIS-
Guys, guys, think about it.
If we could just use the harness funnel and put it up against Dominox, we'll be fine!
-MARISHA-
(excited groan)
-TRAVIS-
We just got to hold it there for like--
-MATT-
See, now that's thinking with portals.
-LAURA-
Think about all the things we could suck up here in Aeor!
-LIAM-
GPK? Greek Party Kill?
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to suck down a grand demon, it'll be great.
-MATT-
Kill the party at the Greek.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
All right, well, that being the case, we'll pick it up then.
Thank you all so much for joining us.
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
(cheering)

Critical Role Exandria Unlimited Episode 6 "The Gift Among the Green"
-AABRIA-
Hi, welcome to episode six of Exandria Unlimited.
I am your DM, Aabria Iyengar, putting it together slowly but surely.
And with me, are we going with the Odd Lot? Hot Cross Bun? It doesn't matter.
Why don't you just introduce yourselves and we can get into the chaos.
Let's talk with Robbie.
-ROBBIE-
(gasps) Let's do start with Robbie.
Hello, my name is Robbie Daymond, and I am playing Dorian Storm, the air genasi bard here to entertain you and potentially betray and murder you all.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Mm.
Vibes! Thank you for that gift.
Inspiration.
-LIAM-
I am Liam O'Brien.
I'm playing Orym of the Air Ashari, a halfling.
Not really a bard, but tonight I will be serving up hot cross buns.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
Hooray.
-ASHLEY-
Hello! Ashley Johnson here playing Fearne Calloway.
Our faun/satyr druid who is just questionable in all things.
(laughter) We're not sure! (laughter)
-ANJALI-
Hello, I'm Anjali Bhimani.
The size of my enthusiasm is rivaled only by the size of my hair.
I am playing Fy'ra Rai, the fire genasi monk with a heart of gold and tattoos to match.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-ANJALI-
They're gold, get it?
-MATT-
Hi, I'm Mathew Mercer.
I play Dariax Zaveon, the dwarf sorcerer, and he has always been and will continue to be a problem.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
Hi, I'm Aimee Carrero.
I play Opal, Hexblade warlock, and tonight she might succeed in vomiting up her twin.
-ANJALI-
Wow!
-AABRIA-
Wow, good informa--
-ANJALI-
Always makes me think of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
"It was her twin!"
-AIMEE-
"They found teeth in my spinal cord, it was my twin." (laughter)
-ANJALI-
Sorry.
-AABRIA-
High on the list of movies I have not seen.
-ANJALI-
It always makes me think of that! "You know, they did the b-b-bibopsy? And it was.
Inside her neck was her twin.
Spanakopita?" (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Amazing. On that note, a perfect segue.
Good for me! Handling it.
All right, these episodes are pre-taped so we're going to throw it to our very good friend, cozy Matt in the future for some announcements.
Take it away, cozy Matt!
-MATT-

And did you make that yourself? Oh my god! You are powerful in your abilities to create outfits.
What a look.
-LIAM-
I mean, you can do anything with food.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, right?!
-AIMEE-
Can we get a tutorial?
-AABRIA-
Honestly.
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, yeah!
-AABRIA-
I would love that!
-ASHLEY-
The skills.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, so multi-talented.
-MATT-
That's great.
Cool.
Cool. Cool game, y'all.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Yep! Now that we've broken Matt's spirit, I think we're ready to begin tonight's episode of Exandria Unlimited.
(cheering) (dramatic music)
The six of you have spent weeks traversing the jungles of the Rifenmist Peninsula.
You've had dreams and experiences and bits of temptation along the way, but you've come through it.
And you reached what very well could've been your goal.
You found some of that runic writing, a ruin in the jungle, but you were pushed, asked, begged by the Wild Mother herself to keep going forward to seek some deeper truth.
And now more time has passed.
And Fy'ra Rai, please make a survival check for me.
-ANJALI-
16.
-AABRIA-
Roll a d6.
-ANJALI-
Four.
-AABRIA-
The way has been cleared for you, and after four more days of travel the terrain begins to shift.
It gets rockier.
Hilly with basalt and porphyry jutting out of the ground at strange angles.
And you know what? Let me get a group perception check as you walk.
-MATT-
All righty.
Yeah! Six!
-AABRIA-
Oh, buddy! (laughs)
-LIAM-
Rolled a two and three.
-AIMEE-
Five.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Five.
-ANJALI-
20.
-AABRIA-
There we go.
-LIAM-
Seven.
-ROBBIE-
A dirty 20.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-AIMEE-
Okay! Two of us!
-ANJALI-
Yeah, mine's dirty, too.
Dirty, dirty 20.
-AABRIA-
Ooh! My dirty genasi with their dirty 20s.
-ANJALI-
Rrow!
-AABRIA-
You have noticed that the terrain is starting to-- even as it's getting rockier and a different kind of difficult terrain to traverse, you've been sloping downward now for about two days.
And you know you're close.
And you begin to hear the sounds of water collecting into little rivulets and streams that you follow as you walk.
-ANJALI-
Little brother.
How are you feeling?
-ROBBIE-
Good.
Better.
-ANJALI-
Good.
No--?
-ROBBIE-
Not quite sure what that means, but no, nothing like that.
-ANJALI-
I was aiming down, not up.
-ROBBIE-
Sure.
-ANJALI-
Yes, right.
There is a different look in your eyes since you had that fitful sleep the other night.
The look of-- It was a look of recognition.
-ROBBIE-
I just feel-- I feel like the way is a bit more clear.
You can feel it too, can't you? The wind feels like it's pushing us forward.
It's the first time we've had any direction in this whole journey, and-- I'm glad you're here with us.
I'm sorry for my behavior before.
-ANJALI-
There is no need to apologize.
You have always been-- You have always been strong-willed.
-ROBBIE-
Well, I'm just grateful you're with us.
And thank you.
Are we having a private conversation?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, do we overhear this?
-AABRIA-
You can decide that! I don't know.
Probably.
-MATT-
I wasn't paying attention.
-AABRIA-
Oh, that's fair.
You guys are right next to Dariax--
-ANJALI-
Did you not see the cone of silence around us?
-MATT-
Yeah, I'm literally staring at both of you and just--
-AABRIA-
Nothing.
-MATT-
I'm hungry.
-LIAM-
I'm Liam.
-AIMEE-
For the pies.
-LIAM-
It's hard to tell sometimes.
-ASHLEY-
How long have we been traveling at this point?
-AABRIA-
Total since leaving Byroden, it's probably been about three and a half weeks.
-AIMEE-
And then since leaving our last--
-AABRIA-
It's been two and a half months.
-AIMEE-
No, I'm saying the ruins.
Or the rune.
-AABRIA-
Oh, the ruins? Four days.
-AIMEE-
Oh, four days, okay.
-ANJALI-
Dariax.
-MATT-
Yeah?
-ANJALI-
When you...
made your writing, rubbing, rub-writing.
-AABRIA-
We didn't have to do that.
-MATT-
When I rubbed my writing, yeah.
-ANJALI-
Did you see all the runes of the same type?
-MATT-
I'm really good at copying.
So, probably? But...
I did a good job, right?
-ROBBIE-
I think as good as any of us could have done.
-MATT-
So yeah, maybe.
-ANJALI-
Just one?
-MATT-
No, I drew a lot of them.
-ANJALI-
But just one language?
-ROBBIE-
It felt like it to me.
-MATT-
See? We're good.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
So no other language to compare it to to translate what the first language is?
-ROBBIE-
We saw what it was even though we couldn't read it.
A laundry list, yes?
-MATT-
Sure. Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Supplies!
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-MATT-
I pat her on the shoulder.
-AIMEE-
Hey Fy'ra, do you know anything about a purple lady? Does that ring a bell?
-ANJALI-
I will need more context than that.
-AIMEE-
Okay, well, my sister was saying-- who's inhabiting my body, I guess, too-- was saying that she kept seeing a purple lady? I just, I don't know.
-ANJALI-
A lady in purple or a purple lady?
-AIMEE-
That's a good question.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, I'm so sorry.
What did you just say? Your sister is in your-- Inhabiting your body?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, it's really weird.
And she doesn't even know where her body is.
Can you imagine being that irresponsible about your possessions?
-ASHLEY-
My.
-AIMEE-
Oh, one second.
She taps the pendant.
Ted!
-AABRIA-
Make a charisma saving throw for me.
-MATT-
I've had a few benders that ended similarly, I guess, but eventually figured it out.
-AIMEE-
Six.
-AABRIA-
"What!"
-AIMEE-
Ted! You didn't tell me! Is the lady all purple--
-AABRIA-
"I'm busy!"
-AIMEE-
What are you busy doing?
-AABRIA-
"It's-- What-- what do you need?"
-AIMEE-
Is the lady in purple wearing purple or is her skin purple?
"I don't know.
I just am aware of purple."
I mean, do you see her?
-AABRIA-
"I'm inside you! With what eyes?!"
-AIMEE-
Stop saying that! Ew! Okay, so you don't know if she's made of purple, you just know she's maybe wearing a purple outfit?
-AABRIA-
"Just-- Probably the latter. I don't know!"
-AIMEE-
Okay. Bye.
-LIAM-
There another half of that conversation?
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-ANJALI-
Have you not been seeing her to have these conversations the entire trip? These one-sided conversations.
-LIAM-
I heard her talk to herself a little bit.
-AIMEE-
No, no, no. I don't talk to myself.
Talking to my sister, Ted, who left her body somewhere unknown! She says that maybe she was wearing purple.
Is there any significance to-- Hold on.
Did she seem evil?
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to walk over to Dariax--
-AABRIA-
There's no response.
-ROBBIE-
-- and say: What are the odds that Ted is real?
-MATT-
Odds are about as good as wanting to trust somebody who wears all purple.
-AIMEE-
Hello?
-ROBBIE-
That's a good point.
-AIMEE-
I'm sorry, she's not responding.
Ted! Well, it seems that the connection's bad.
She said that she kept seeing-- Okay, so I had this dream four nights ago.
Whenever we left after our test, after I wrestled the croc, I had this dream where I was talking to my sister who then was like, "I'm in your body," and I'm like, "Stop." But then she also told me, she was like, "Do you see the purple lady?" And I'm like, "What purple lady?" And she was like, "That purple lady by the fire." And that's it.
I don't know. Do you know anybody who wears a lot of purple?
-LIAM-
Doesn't seem like much to go on.
-AIMEE-
I know.
-AABRIA-
You know what? Squad history check.
-MATT-
18.
-AABRIA-
Oh sh--! Okay!
-AIMEE-
Dirty 20!
-ASHLEY-
Dang!
-AIMEE-
I know, finally.
-ANJALI-
13.
-AABRIA-
All right!
-ASHLEY-
10.
-LIAM-
19.
-ROBBIE-
21.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god! Okay! We'll start here.
Fy'ra, you...
rifling through everything you know about deities and magical-- purple is a color associated with magic a lot.
So that could mean a plethora of beings and deities and fey.
There's not a lot to go on there.
You need more information.
However, everyone, except maybe Fearne.
No, I'll give it to you all.
You do remember a squad of people that were clad in all purple.
The elves from Syngorn.
-MATT-
A squad in all purple.
The Purple Man Group out of Kymal.
-AABRIA-
I hate you.
Hate you.
-AIMEE-
Ted. I know you're listening.
Was that the lady I gave attitude to that one time?
-AABRIA-
You feel stress, but no response.
-AIMEE-
Anyone have any food or something I can-- I'm really stressed out.
Ted, just let me know, okay? Bye.
I did give attitude to this lady once.
An elf.
Remember? She was like, after we saw evil you and then you were like, "Don't take it out on her, you're projecting." And I'm like, "I'm not projecting," but I totally was projecting.
-ANJALI-
The warden of the gate.
The ones we left behind.
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
M-M-Myr'atta? I have it written down.
I don't know if this is correct.
-AABRIA-
Yo, inspiration because you wrote the name down and said it correctly!
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I do remember her.
She was very--
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah. Myr'atta Elsinore?
-AABRIA-
Niselor.
-ASHLEY-
What is it? Because I was nervous to say it.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
-ASHLEY-
I have a question mark next to it.
Niselor. N-I-S-E-L-O-R.
-AIMEE-
She was wearing purple.
Is there a way for her to be spying on us?
-ANJALI-
The ways of magic are powerful, but more in your wealth of knowledge than mine, perhaps.
-AIMEE-
Oh, I have no wealth of knowledge.
-ASHLEY-
It is very possible, I think.
-MATT-
I thought I was more of a navy myself, but I'll go with the group.
-ANJALI-
Can I use The Gift to see if I need to protect them from this purple lady?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Roll with disadvantage.
-ANJALI-
Which one is it? Insight or perception? Oh, they're both the same.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, but that was plus that-- okay, it's 19.
-AABRIA-
With a 19, you're walking, and now the the actual canopy overhead as you've been walking has broken up a little bit more and there's big rays of sun poking through.
And as you walk into one, your vision disappears as it's trying to adjust to a big flash of light.
And in that moment, your eyes, the inward ones turn not just to yourself, but to Opal, and you see a set of eyes behind Opal.
Purple.
She's being watched right now.
-ANJALI-
Stay close.
-ASHLEY-
What's wrong?
-ANJALI-
You will be fine.
-AIMEE-
Okay. Do I have to-- Say magic or--?
-ANJALI-
You will be fine.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
What does that mean? Is she okay?
-AIMEE-
I feel okay.
-ANJALI-
Everything is fine.
We should keep moving, though.
-MATT-
How does the path look ahead? Is it getting denser and denser? Is there a defined path that we're supposed to be taking at this point?
-AABRIA-
So you're walking forward and it's actually, everything is going more to stone and rockiness and less of that heavy green canopy.
Go ahead and make a survival check for me.
-MATT-
All right.
Hell yeah. Five.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
He's not giving up on those dice!
-ROBBIE-
He stubbed his toe on a piece of basalt! (laughter)
-MATT-
I'm the best! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Nailing it! I will give that you hear more water.
-MATT-
Is anyone thirsty? Or got to pee? I got both.
-LIAM-
I could do both of those things.
-AIMEE-
How can you be thirsty and have to pee?
-LIAM-
Oh, easily if you hydrate a lot.
-ANJALI-
Move quickly.
-LIAM-
Kind of a cycle.
-MATT-
Water...
I'm hearing something.
Is it river water, is it like a waterfall? Is it like--
-AABRIA-
You rolled a five.
-MATT-
Yeah, you're right.
-AABRIA-
I'm just kidding.
-MATT-
No, it's valid! That's valid! I'm assuming it's a gorgeous waterfall and it's...
somewhere.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ANJALI-
Follow me.
And I go a different direction.
-AABRIA-
Oh, okay.
-ANJALI-
Towards the sound of the water, but not where he is pointing.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Respect.
-MATT-
I will swallow my pride and follow her.
-AABRIA-
Respect.
You curve around in a different direction and you walk maybe 30 more feet and realize that you guys were at the edge of a cliff.
And yeah, there's a massive water-- Well, it's not massive.
It's a 12-foot waterfall a couple of feet off to the side, and you're looking down now into this huge basin.
And at the center of the basin where it slopes down looking from here, maybe 30 or 40 feet, you see the massive 100-foot high walls of gray-green of a citadel, but not the ruins of one.
A fully-formed city.
Massive.
With a low fog sort of roiling around its edges at the center.
-LIAM-
For clarity.
The waterfall you said is only 12 feet.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
This city, are we seeing over the tops of all buildings in this city?
-AABRIA-
No. Sorry.
-LIAM-
Is it rising?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it's about 100 yards in you see the beginning of this city and it rises up.
So it looks like if you were on the level land, you've been walking as a slope for a while, that the whole thing would probably be right around the canopy top.
But where you are now, where the tree line falls away, you can see from a top to tip is about 100 feet high.
-AIMEE-
Do we know what the city is? Is it on the map?
-ANJALI-
I just take a deep breath in.
We have arrived.
-AIMEE-
Where?
-MATT-
To--?
-ANJALI-
Welcome to Niirdal-Poc.
-LIAM-
You knew we were going here? Specifically?
-ROBBIE-
I thought this was supposed to be a ruin, not a fully-functional city.
-AABRIA-
Anyone that would like to can make a history check.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Having heard the name.
You don't need to! You've been here!
-ANJALI-
Bad dice!
-MATT-
Decline.
-AABRIA-
Oh! Respect.
-MATT-
Because I would have no idea.
-AIMEE-
15.
-AABRIA-
Inspiration for not taking part.
15?
-LIAM-
19.
-AIMEE-
Oh, go with him.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah. 13.
-ROBBIE-
I feel the same way.
I feel pretty cloistered.
I don't think I know.
-AABRIA-
Oh, okay.
For my 15 and 19, that name rings a bell.
When you learn about ancient civilizations across the long span of Tal'Dorei's history, there was a civilization that was old when the Calamity hit that was a lost forever ago called Niirdal-Poc.
-ASHLEY-
Say it again.
-AABRIA-
Niirdal-Poc.
-ASHLEY-
Niirdal-Poc--
-LIAM-
Niirdal.
-AIMEE-
So for all our knowledge, it no longer exists, so it's surprising to see that--
-AABRIA-
You would expect to see ruins.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Easy analog is ancient Egypt.
If you rocked up on the Pyramid of Giza and homies were just like, "Oh, what's up?"
-LIAM-
And on that note, is this abandoned or do we see anything? Movement, life?
-MATT-
Is there an entrance way?
-AABRIA-
Give me perception check.
-AIMEE-
Damn, we're curious.
-AABRIA-
There's a low fog. I would hope so! I've been building to this shit for a second! If you were like, "Anyway!"
-AIMEE-
We want to know!
-AABRIA-
"All right, let's go to the river!"
-AIMEE-
Let's go to the waterfall!
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
I think it's beautiful!
-LIAM-
It's 14.
-MATT-
I am looking at the waterfall with a zero.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
-AIMEE-
What! (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
It's so pretty, though!
-MATT-
It's like: I asked if you're thirsty! I'm just filling up my wine skin.
(laughter) Like: Oh, where'd that wall come from! (laughter)
-AIMEE-
I half-expected you to just dive off the cliff.
-MATT-
Yeah. I'm just skinny-dipping right now.
-AABRIA-
Explodes out of the clothing.
-ASHLEY-
Dirty 20.
-AABRIA-
Okay!
-ROBBIE-
12.
-AABRIA-
All right.
Just Fearne, as you look down, you see that it's not just water sort of pouring off of these little waterfalls that are ringing the basin, but a low-lying fog that you've been easily ignoring as you've been walking seeps off the edges and pools into this basin, too.
But you look deeper into it and you see, yeah, there's movement in the fog around edges of these walls.
there's movement in the fog around edges of these walls.
And you see, faintly, that there are people slipping in and out of these nigh imperceptible gates that blend into the curved gray-green architecture.
-ASHLEY-
There seems to be people going in and out of the fog.
-ANJALI-
Indeed there are.
-AIMEE-
(gasps)
-LIAM-
You've been here before?
-ANJALI-
I have.
-ROBBIE-
What is this place? It seems so old, but--
-LIAM-
Why is this-- why?
-ANJALI-
Why not?
-LIAM-
I haven't heard much about this place, but I haven't heard that it's still...
going.
-ANJALI-
It is not available to the vision of everyone.
Come.
We all go there and you will learn more, hmm?
-LIAM-
Lead the way.
-ANJALI-
Just checking, is it just a 12-foot drop? Do I know of any easy way down other than that? Or is it just the 12-foot drop?
-AABRIA-
It's just a 12-foot drop.
-ANJALI-
Okay, great.
So I'm just going to turn around and free climb down.
-AABRIA-
Cool.
-ANJALI-
And then I look up and I think about the folks behind me and I take my rope and I toss it up to one of them and I say: Secure this! And then I jump down.
-AABRIA-
I'm not going to make you roll for it.
You absolutely do that.
It's 12 feet.
-ANJALI-
I can do that in these heels.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
<i>You</i> can!
-MATT-
That is the definition of dope monk shit.
-ASHLEY-
You absolutely can.
-AABRIA-
100%.
-ASHLEY-
I kind of want to jump in.
-MATT-
I'm already in. I'm skinny-dipping.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, great! Jump in.
-MATT-
I wasn't joking! I rolled a zero! I don't give a shit about this town right now!
-AABRIA-
Did you just go?
-MATT-
I just went like: Wah!
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ROBBIE-
Just a butt-naked dwarf diving off into-- Perfect.
-MATT-
You can tell the deftness in which he disrobes mid-leap that he's done this before.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
You got to give me an acrobatics or athletics check to see how we do on that.
-MATT-
I respect that.
I will take the 14 on acrobatics.
-AABRIA-
Okay!
-ANJALI-
Okay! Good job, boo boo!
-AABRIA-
Mr. Mercer, can you paint me a word picture of what this looks like as everyone just sees you boop off the edge?
-MATT-
So while they're having this intense conversation about the unveiling of this rich history of this ancient city that still exists and the wonderment and the questions and the pride and the curiosity, in the background, you just see this streak of flesh in the background, you just see this streak of flesh as in an instant, Dariax just goes: Last one in is a rotten bird something! And then just runs and leaps off the edge, 12 feet down into the water, not really caring how deep it might be, but goes into a full cannonball.
-LIAM-
Is it a naked cannonball?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
I'll say mostly naked.
By the time he gets off the cliff, he still has one leg in the pants, but he'll deal with it later.
-AABRIA-
Respect.
Yeah, you dive in and the water is warm at the top and quickly-- this is incredibly deep, and the temperature drops as you go four, five, 12 feet under the water.
And you can come up and yeah, you're part of this slow-moving river that just sort of circumnavigates.
-ROBBIE-
Does the river go into the city?
-AABRIA-
You see points at which it does go in, but you've got a lazy river situation.
It's going around.
-ROBBIE-
He's lazy rivering his way into the city?
-AABRIA-
Possibly.
Depends on if he keeps going.
-MATT-
I'm fighting the current because I still want to get my clothes.
I'm just enjoying the drop and it's like: Hey! Dorian, can you throw my stuff down? I didn't think this through!
-ROBBIE-
Has naked Fearne jumped in as well?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I gave you my clothes.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I'm mothering everyone's clothes together.
I've got it, all right, cool.
-ANJALI-
Your cloak works so well for the glitter shitter!
-AABRIA-
Mister takes a little poop and puts it in your hand.
We're handing you stuff.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god!
-ROBBIE-
I'll bundle it all in my cape.
-AABRIA-
Synchronized-- (yelps)
-ANJALI-
Don't forget the rope!
-ROBBIE-
I'll one-hand slide it down the thing with all of their sopping clothes and set it gently by the shore until they're done.
-AIMEE-
I definitely think Opal would also jump in, but she'd take off her jacket and fashion it into some sort of hair protector.
-AABRIA-
Respect.
-AIMEE-
Because she does not want to get it wet.
But it's a 12-foot drop, so she probably gets it wet.
But she's trying.
-AABRIA-
Well, let me get a dive in roll from you.
Either athletics or acrobatics.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Oh, natural 20!
-AABRIA-
Oh, snap!
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-AIMEE-
Maybe her hair doesn't get wet!
-AABRIA-
Your turban game is so strong you hair does not get wet!
-AIMEE-
No!
-AABRIA-
Absolutely not.
This is power-gaming for me.
You didn't want your hair to get wet and it didn't! Yeah!
-AIMEE-
Not even the back! Not even the baby hair!
And the baby hairs stay down in all defiance of logic! Oh god, I love this game!
-ANJALI-
I want this game to be reality.
-AABRIA-
I love the power of imagination.
-ANJALI-
So much!
-ASHLEY-
I got an 18.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! Okay, so what does it look like? Paint me word pictures, both of you.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I think Fearne just takes just a big old Mirthful Leap and just jumps right in and just flopping around.
Nothing fancy, and just floating on her back and just fully just out there for the world.
Just having a blast.
-AABRIA-
Mister's like a little iceberg of just the top of his head out of the water and he's blowing up bubbles.
And if you're near him, it's a warm spot and you're not super sure if it's because he's a fire elemental or just actively peeing.
-AIMEE-
Oh god! The worst!
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Opal takes her sateen jacket off and she makes it look like a very nice protected hair covering.
And then she does a thing that a lot of girls do when they're like, "No, don't push me in! No, don't push me in!"
-LIAM-
Don't make me sing.
-AIMEE-
Don't make me sing!
-ASHLEY-
Don't make me dance!
-AIMEE-
Don't make me dance.
But is kind of sad no one pushed her in.
(laughter) Don't push me in! Looks around, no one's there to push her in.
So then she just goes, okay--
-AABRIA-
Hold on! There's a chance! Orym?
-LIAM-
Are you already down?
-AIMEE-
No, not yet. She's like: Don't do it!
-LIAM-
No, Orym is actually casually watching Dorian carry all the stuff including the boxed up crown down, down, down, down, down just to make sure that everything's copacetic.
-AIMEE-
And she's watching him do that.
And she's like: Okay.
And so with no one there to push her in she just falls that way.
-MATT-
Little Mermaids it.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
And then once they're all down Orym will flash a smile at Dorian and give him a totally friendly thumbs up and then he disappears from view and you hear (running footsteps) And because of the boots, he hits the edge and leaps 30 feet straight out from the edge of the cliff into the center of whatever this water is.
-AIMEE-
Nice!
-LIAM-
Hopefully does not slap the water.
He does not. 17.
-AABRIA-
Oh beautiful, yeah!
-AIMEE-
Yay!
-MATT-
Well done, Orym!
-AIMEE-
Nancy! Nice to see you having a little fun!
-LIAM-
I got to be me!
-AABRIA-
Okay, so you two, I'm assuming, are walking on the ground beside the sort of lazy river, yes? Okay.
-MATT-
Sure you guys don't want to come in? It's very nice!
-ANJALI-
I'm enjoying watching you.
They are like children.
-ASHLEY-
It's pretty warm!
-AIMEE-
Oh, because of Mister.
-ANJALI-
Dorian, let me take something.
-ASHLEY-
Sometimes it is.
-ROBBIE-
Sure.
And I'll give her half of the clothes.
-ANJALI-
And my rope.
-ROBBIE-
Yes. And definitely not the crown.
I'll hold on to that.
-ANJALI-
Which I clock.
-ROBBIE-
Sure.
-ANJALI-
Definitely clock.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ANJALI-
Put these under my arm.
The test that you all were given, you passed with flying colors, no? This is why you are here.
The jungle wants you to see things.
It is time for you to see them.
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
(blowing bubbles) (laughter)
-AABRIA-
And as you're walking beside them, walking through the lazy river, you remember that this place is a citadel.
It is a fortress and there are these massive vertical slits throughout the big sort of curved architecture.
And you know that there are guards here, if you want to do anything about that.
If not, they can for sure just keep floating down the river and I won't do anything bad or scary to them about it.
-ANJALI-
I am actually going to move ahead a little bit to where those slits are.
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ANJALI-
And gesture to the guards and give them a sign that we know, that I and the guards know, as a sign of recognition that I am bringing friends.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
So you walk up and just getting into view, perception check.
-ANJALI-
16.
-AABRIA-
With a 16, you walk up and you hear a little (thwip) and a little cloud of dust gets kicked up three feet in front of your left foot and you see a small, black, perfect circle of basalt on the ground.
And you're able to follow the trajectory up and you see a sling-holding soldier in the window and that's who you need to signal, so.
-ANJALI-
Excellent. I will reach up.
I will pass my signal to him.
It is I, Fy'ra Rai.
-AABRIA-
Give me a-- Because we got to see, there's always a chance that this one doesn't know you.
Give me a persuasion check.
-ANJALI-
Oh, phew, okay.
16.
-AABRIA-
With a 16, you see a single flame emit and burns in the window in this gray, gold-- It's a very de-saturated light.
You recognize it, as you've been inside the city walls for quite some time and you know that it's a hold.
-ANJALI-
All right.
My friends, tread your water.
Hold back for a moment.
-MATT-
Aight.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Shout out to everyone doing it.
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-AIMEE-
I love how everyone actually does it, I'm just like, "This works." (laughter)
-AABRIA-
It's roughly the same.
-ASHLEY-
I swim with my wrists.
-ANJALI-
I do clock this moment of grace, they're all so graceful for the first time since I've met them and in perfect synchronization.
I'm very impressed.
-LIAM-
Doing ballet.
-AIMEE-
There you go.
-ANJALI-
Very proud of you.
-ROBBIE-
Only 'cause their asses are out.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Butt-ass naked in the water.
-ANJALI-
I look up and I say: Soldier, what more do you need?
-AABRIA-
You don't hear a response.
The easy assumption is that they're going to double-check, because they don't necessarily recognize you.
-ANJALI-
I'm not a patient woman.
-AABRIA-
And after about five minutes, the light goes out and you see that down, if you follow it straight down to the bottom where the ground meets this massive gray-green wall, part of the wall slides away and the gate is open to you.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
Come, my friends.
It is time to come on land.
-MATT-
All right!
-AABRIA-
Those of you in the water, you actually see, as you float up and get closer, that there are little channels cut into this lazy river around that go into grading, that push the water into the city, but you can't float directly in there.
Or you could if you really want to, but it's going to be hard.
-ASHLEY-
I walk out and do one of those dog shakes, where I start with my head, and then wiggle the tail.
Give it a little.
-AIMEE-
So cute.
-ROBBIE-
I've already got everybody's stuff laid out for them on the bank.
-AABRIA-
Oh, you're so nice.
-ASHLEY-
Thanks, dad.
-AIMEE-
That's cute.
-MATT-
Thanks, buddy.
-AABRIA-
Dad vibes.
-MATT-
All right, check, check, all here.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
Now, my friends, this is a friendly city, but it is a place you must respect.
Hmm? No-- how do you say-- snarkiness? Careful. Gentle.
Treat them as you would a respected elder and all will be well.
Hmm?
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Got it.
-AABRIA-
As you pass through the gate, you go inside and you walk through what feels like 40 feet of tunneling, before you're able to break into the city proper.
And you are inside the ancient stronghold of Niirdal-Poc and the fog is inside this place too, but it's sort of-- It's lighter and wispier and permeates everything and there're lanterns all over and they all glow with the same greenish-goldish-grayish light that doesn't quite burn.
Doesn't make sense.
And you pass through on this very well cobbled, well-maintained city path and you pass these massive buildings of that same gray-green.
It's not cobblestone.
It's covered over with a concrete in this strange color that your eye slips by naturally.
And all these buildings are multistory with little carved terraces and you see tiny gardens and people tending them and the people inside it, you see lots of humans and half-elves, yes, but also gnomes and halflings and even more interesting races.
You see hobgoblins, and goblins, and people with the faces of cats and elephants and birds.
This place is wild and different, and everyone walks through the mists silently, but very serenely.
And they give you a little look and a little nod as to acknowledge, yes, you are new and we know everyone here, but the city is massive.
15,000 people moving about their daily life.
Yeah?
-ROBBIE-
Can I ask a question?
-AABRIA-
Absolutely.
-ROBBIE-
This might be a perception question.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
-ROBBIE-
Does the city feel distinctly ancient or does it have-- The architecture of the city, could it exist in the world at large now? Is it modern or is it ancient, I suppose?
-AABRIA-
It is ancient. However, the architecture is extraordinarily different.
Most of Tal'Dorei is very medieval, Western European-coded, and this has a lot of curves to it and arches.
And it's that strangeness of the lack of cobblestone and visible stone-age, that everything is covered over and smoothed over with this gray-green concrete.
So there is something distinctly old about it, because you see there's something in its simplicity that feels ancient, but it's very distinct and unique from Tal'Dorei or at large, farther north.
-AIMEE-
And would the average person living in Tal'Dorei see goblins on a daily basis, or?
-AABRIA-
Absolutely not.
-AIMEE-
Not, okay.
-AABRIA-
They are rare.
-AIMEE-
So it'd be like a-- And also, are they dressed anciently? I don't know if that makes sense.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
-AIMEE-
Is it like stepping into a storybook? Something that you'd read in a history book?
-AABRIA-
It does feel like stepping into a history book-vibe.
The clothing is way more simply cut.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
And a little rougher--
-AIMEE-
Gotcha.
-AABRIA-
-- to it, but very sleek, very timeless in that this is a place that was sort of robbed of the natural flow of time.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god, did you see the cat face?
-ROBBIE-
That's not polite.
-AIMEE-
Oh, sorry.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, are you from here?
-ANJALI-
No, I am not from here, but strangely, now I feel that I'm of here.
Does that make sense?
-ASHLEY-
I think so.
-ANJALI-
I will tell you a story when I take you to someone special.
-ROBBIE-
Hmm?
-AIMEE-
Who?
-ANJALI-
You will see.
Now she's giddy like a schoolgirl, no one has ever seen her like this.
I am just excited to take these guys where we're going.
-ROBBIE-
Orym, have you ever heard of anything like this before?
-LIAM-
Barely.
I've heard the name muttered around me a few times, but as a place from the past.
This doesn't make any sense to me.
-ROBBIE-
Something like this shouldn't exist.
-LIAM-
It's a big world.
-ANJALI-
Can I hear them?
-AABRIA-
Perception check.
-ANJALI-
No, I cannot hear them.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Or maybe I can.
It's a 13.
-AABRIA-
I'm going to say no, I'm going to let them have this little quiet moment.
And y-- Oh, go ahead.
-AIMEE-
Anyone hungry?
-ROBBIE-
Yes.
-LIAM-
What do you got?
-AIMEE-
Oh, no, I just meant maybe you could take us somewhere fun?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, maybe we should eat somewhere. What--
-AIMEE-
That isn't pie?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, what's the food of--?
-ANJALI-
I have a quick stop.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
So I'm going to navigate quickly, again, excited through the streets, and as we're going by, we're seeing houses and we're seeing these homes with these lovely enclosed areas.
We come to a smaller one than the rest.
Seems a little bit less ornate, less impressive.
And I gently rap on the door.
(knocking) (whispering) Be home, be home, be home, be home.
-AABRIA-
And you hear a voice call out, but not in Common.
Just (speaking foreign language).
-ANJALI-
Fy'ra Rai (speaking foreign language)
-AABRIA-
And you hear (clattering) as the door immediately slams open and you're face to face with a tall, older earth genasi.
-ANJALI-
Hello, my friend.
-AABRIA-
"Hello, how are you? Fy'ra-- oh! Others? My goodness.
How do you say-- My name is Elam.
Are these your friends?"
-ANJALI-
They are.
More than friends.
We are close and this is their first time to Niirdal-Poc
-AABRIA-
"Well, we don't get very many new people.
Please, come-- Do--? Okay, come in, come in, please come in."
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
That's very kind of you.
-AIMEE-
I whisper to Fearne: Have you ever seen her this excited?
-ASHLEY-
No!
-AIMEE-
It's kind of nice.
-ASHLEY-
I know, it is nice.
I didn't know she had it in her.
-AIMEE-
Neither did I.
-ASHLEY-
It's great.
-AABRIA-
And as you turn, this woman sweeps by and you smell the scent of her, sort of on her clothes and on her hair is very wet, very fertile soil.
It's that smell.
As she turns in and you're in the center of her house, it is...
too decorated, is what I would say.
Just very plush rugs that go all the way to the edges of this fairly small living room.
There's art all over the walls.
Lots of little carved statues of purple porphyry all over little tables with lamps and blankets everywhere.
And really overfilled plush pillows of vibrant, but sort of-- Vibrancy here is a little strange, so it's all a little muted, but your eyes are quickly adjusting to what passes for color here and these beautiful dark burgundies and purples and blues everywhere.
And you can weave through this very crushed living room as she leads you up the stairs and out to a little patio.
-ANJALI-
You always were the finest hostess.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) "Thank you.
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm so glad that you're safe.
You were out there, you know, it's a whole--"
-ANJALI-
It's surprisingly friendly, except for a few encounters.
My friends and I have traveled very far.
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-ANJALI-
Might we avail ourselves of...
perhaps one of your fine meals?
-AABRIA-
"Do you have-- Yes, you all have time! You will stay here.
Stay here.
Hold on, hold on.
You didn't--? I have to show--? Hold on." And she disappears out through the door and leaves you on this little patio where you're overlooking this little terraced garden with little sprouts.
Looking out, you can see other tall buildings.
And just about every one of these homes has a little terraced garden that has different kinds of farms, some of them are flowers, some of them are very clearly food, some of them are big, strange-looking mushrooms and fungi and ornamental things.
And everyone's decided what to do with their own space.
But this is very much a micro greens, little garden situation.
And then the door opens just a crack behind you and a big, extremely furry, curly, dark-furrred dog wanders out.
-ALL-
(gasping)
-ANJALI-
(laughs) It is good to see you, my friend, as well!
-AABRIA-
He hops up.
He is at your full height when he stands up on his hind legs and gives you some really sloppy-- Not-- It's a musty breath.
Licks and is just attacking you with licks and chewing on the edges of your hair.
-ANJALI-
Don't get burned, my friend, don't get burned, remember that happened last time!
-AABRIA-
(panting)
-ASHLEY-
I can't help it, I just go over and just get on the ground with him and just give him all the scritches and loves.
Hello, hello!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Ooh!
-AABRIA-
He's got a little collar around his neck.
But the tag on it is in that runic language.
It's not in Common.
-ASHLEY-
What is this animal's name?
-ANJALI-
This is Googal.
-ASHLEY-
Google?
-ANJALI-
Go-o-gal.
Googal.
-ASHLEY-
Googal.
-AIMEE-
Googal.
-ANJALI-
Googal.
-ROBBIE-
Googal.
-AABRIA-
And as you say his name every time, he's just--
-ANJALI-
Ah, goo, goo, goo, goo.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
A little goo-goo.
-AABRIA-
(growling)
-ANJALI-
(laughs) Goo goo. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
He's drooling onto the ground over his head as he's just, tummy time for all of you and you hear that woman.
"Just pet him for a little bit.
I am whipping something together.
You have to warn people before you show up!"
-ANJALI-
You know I would not ask if it was just for me.
-AABRIA-
"Okay-- Yes, you would.
That's a lie."
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"You are a liar.
Have you seen the Tetrarchs yet?"
-ANJALI-
We have not, but my friends needed some sustenance before another surprise.
-AABRIA-
You hear footsteps sprint up the stairs again and she peeks back through the door.
"Wait, you came here before the Tetrarchs?"
-ANJALI-
I did.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) "You like me more.
I will make you something special.
I will actually use-- I'll use fire.
I was going to do like a salad, but now I'm going to cook something.
Okay, okay."
-AIMEE-
Nice.
-ANJALI-
Genar is the best cook in all of Niirdal-Poc.
-AIMEE-
Wow.
-ANJALI-
And believe me, I have tried many, many people's cooking here.
-LIAM-
I'm so ready.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Too excited.
I'm out of crumbs since he's been reaching into his pouch with leftover pie edges that he's just barely scraping out, super stale.
-ANJALI-
My friend, whatever you do, don't let her know you've been eating that.
She would be offended on your own behalf.
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Throws the bag across the room like it's on fire.
My apologies.
-AABRIA-
Googal is going to get up and just start getting in there.
-AIMEE-
Googal.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-MATT-
Eh, it's fine.
Oh, wait, no! Wait, no, you got it.
Who has the crown now?
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah.
-ROBBIE-
I--
-AABRIA-
Who does have the crown?
-ROBBIE-
I put it back with your things, yeah.
-MATT-
(shouts) As I grab the bag.
Because the last thing we need is a dog of that size--
-ANJALI-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Hold on.
We're going to make that a check.
Oh, I rolled good.
Go ahead and make a-- call it a dexterity check for me.
-MATT-
All righty.
-AABRIA-
He got in there real quick.
-MATT-
I'm going to use my inspiration.
-AABRIA-
Maybe a good call.
You got to beat an 18.
-MATT-
Is it with advantage with inspiration or is it reroll? The second roll? I'm trying to remember.
-AABRIA-
You can pick the better roll.
-MATT-
Okay, I won't take the natural one.
-AABRIA-
Oh god.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, wow.
-AIMEE-
Oh gosh.
-AABRIA-
Sir, do you need some other dice?
-AIMEE-
I've been saying that for a week.
-MATT-
No, it's my Gilmore dice! I'm going to use it forever.
(laughter)
I refuse. 10.
-AABRIA-
I'll trade you, because I am Gilmore now.
-MATT-
It is true. 10.
10.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You go in and dive behind Googal, but you can tell he's already worrying on something wrapped up in brown leather and cloth and he's chewing on it and he's pulling at it.
-MATT-
Googal! Goo, goo, buddy. (laughs) Hey, I need that crown.
-AABRIA-
He's got it under the fabric, in his mouth.
-ANJALI-
Googal, (speaking foreign language)!
-AABRIA-
And you see him immediately slink down like, "Oh, we doing this? Fine, we're playing."
-ANJALI-
Googal, leave it.
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
-AABRIA-
(growling) He's got it.
He's going to sprint.
What do you guys want to do about this?
-AIMEE-
Can I cast Druidcraft and maybe fashion some sort of food or something that he might want? I don't know.
-AABRIA-
Is that how Druidcraft works?
-AIMEE-
I don't know!
-AABRIA-
I know you're reading that spell.
-AIMEE-
It says a harmless-- Oh, I could do a harmless sensory effect.
So how about--
-ANJALI-
Taste is a sense.
-AIMEE-
Taste is a scent.
How about I just grab one of the micro greens, but make it smell and taste like something he would want to eat?
-AABRIA-
What do you think he would want to eat?
-AIMEE-
He's a dog! I don't know. Another animal?
-AABRIA-
I'm saying, you can't tell me to tell you what the best thing is.
-AIMEE-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
You have to make a choice with your cantrip, baby girl.
-AIMEE-
So I grab one of the micro greens from the garden--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
-- and I somehow I use this cantrip and I make it smell like the most delicious liverwurst jerky that a dog would like, or one of those bully sticks, just disgusting.
Smells so gross.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Just a funky-ass-- okay.
-LIAM-
Do you know what those are made of?
-AIMEE-
Be like: Googal--
-ANJALI-
You don't want to know.
-AIMEE-
I think it's cow penis.
-ANJALI-
Yes, it is.
-AABRIA-
What?!
-LIAM-
Correct, correct.
-ANJALI-
Bully stick scent.
-LIAM-
Bully stick is--
-AIMEE-
They're so disgusting.
-LIAM-
-- is cow penis.
-AIMEE-
So a cow penis treat and I--
-MATT-
Like Ma used to make.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
All right, make an animal handling check for me.
-AIMEE-
Okay, oh shit.
-AABRIA-
As you're holding up, you see him do something like, "Huh?" as he's looking at a little plant which he's already learned is not food for him, but it smells like liver-y bull dick.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
So that'll be a 14.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
I'll roll against that.
Ooh.
And he's still got it in his mouth and he gets a little closer to you and sniffs it, but then he looks at all of you and sees the intensity on your eyes with what he has, and he crouches even lower and goes (growling) and backs away from you.
-AIMEE-
Ugh, shit.
-MATT-
We're about to create the big bad, aren't we?
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to sprint over to him and I'm going to grab him by the collar and I'm going to see if I can forcibly just pull it out of his mouth.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Let's call that a-- Are you trying to--
-ROBBIE-
He's got a collar on, right?
-AABRIA-
He does have a collar on, yes.
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to grab him by the collar with one hand and with my left hand I'm going to put my hand over his muzzle.
And this is a dog handling technique that is not the nicest.
And I'm going to take his upper jaw and pinch it into the top of his teeth to try to get him to release it.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, okay.
You can either call that animal handling and I'll give you advantage-- Yeah, let's go--
-ROBBIE-
He's big, though, right?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Strength? I don't know, animal handling? All right.
-AABRIA-
Let's call it animal handling with advantage.
Because if it becomes a strength thing, he's going to start--
-ROBBIE-
That is a one.
-AIMEE-
No.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
That's why advantage is important!
-ROBBIE-
Oh, 19 with animal handling, that's 20.
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah.
I'll roll against it.
Yeah.
And you're able-- you hear him just sort of-- he doesn't quite whimper, you're not hurting him.
He just doesn't-- You're not playing right.
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
So that is the sound he's making.
(yelping) As you get his mouth open and you're actually able to reach it-- Well, you've got his mouth open and you're holding onto his collar.
-AIMEE-
I can reach in.
-AABRIA-
Are you going to let go of one of those two things in order to get the thing out?
-AIMEE-
No, I'll reach in.
-ROBBIE-
No, he would release it or it would go lax enough for someone to grab it, one of the other.
-AABRIA-
Well, it's kind of a hoop.
So you've got a hoop thing, it's sort of sitting gently in his mouth.
I just want someone else to have to get in there to--
-AIMEE-
I'll grab it.
-AABRIA-
I have more opportunities to make this go bad.
-AIMEE-
I'll grab it, but I'll use two fingers and the cloth.
So I'd try not to touch the actual crown.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Okay. Yeah.
I'm not going to make you roll for it.
You reach in and you grab it and you get it out of his mouth and he's just sort of tongue lolling like-- (open mouth sounds)
-MATT-
I'll go ahead and grab it.
-AIMEE-
Get the bag! Get the bag.
-MATT-
I got the bag, I got the bag.
-ANJALI-
Give him the bully stick.
-AIMEE-
Oh!
-ROBBIE-
Here you go.
-AABRIA-
And he goes and bites it and it's just smell.
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
Now he hates me.
-ANJALI-
Oh, damn it, I thought it was a-- Forgot that.
-LIAM-
Just a fart smell.
-ROBBIE-
If I've still got his collar, I'm going to just try to gently pet him to get him to hopefully appease me.
And did I hear you right when you said that his collar had a rune on as a tag?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
All right. So I clocked that.
I'm going to flip his collar around and look at the rune on his tag and show the group.
Saying: Did you see this?
-AIMEE-
Hmm?
-ROBBIE-
This isn't some obscure marking.
If they're using this as a tag, that's his name.
They know how to read these symbols.
-LIAM-
That's right.
-MATT-
Well, that's great! Then we just ask your friend after they're done making food, if they know what that rune on the big ash hole was.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
That is surprisingly smart, Dariax.
-AIMEE-
Well, your rubbing.
-ASHLEY-
Very true.
Very true.
-ROBBIE-
Good boy.
I let him go.
-AABRIA-
He is looking at you like you are a betrayer god.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Sorry, pup.
-AABRIA-
He just walks off to the side, curls up, sniffs at the thing that smells amazing.
Licks it again.
You just hear (whimpering).
-AIMEE-
Sorry, buddy.
-AABRIA-
And just sort of flumps down in the corner.
-ASHLEY-
Come here, come here.
Come here.
You get over here right now.
-AABRIA-
He does the little, couple of steps to crawl.
Kind of just does the dog crawl over to you.
-ASHLEY-
I get on all fours and I just start wiggling.
Come here.
-AABRIA-
Do an animal handling check for me.
-ANJALI-
That's so cute, I can't--
-ROBBIE-
This is why you never played D&amp;D with children and animals.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Are they both doing that cat gif?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
How'd you roll? Does he do it back?
-ASHLEY-
19.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, he does it back immediately, he comes over and you see him drop his funk as he gives both of you a dirty look and yeah, he's playing with you.
-ASHLEY-
It's okay. It needed to be done, it needed to be done.
-MATT-
Fy'ra Rai, so this is your second home or a place you call a pseudo home? I don't know where I am, so I'm just wondering if how, how, how, how?
-ANJALI-
Perhaps I will fill you in a little bit more before we reach the Tetrarchs.
-MATT-
Sure.
-LIAM-
Before we reach, what was that?
-AIMEE-
Titty tracks.
-AABRIA-
Hey. (laughs) Hatred.
Flames.
-ANJALI-
The Tetrarchs.
-ROBBIE-
With such confidence.
-AIMEE-
The titty tracks.
-LIAM-
The tracks.
-ANJALI-
The Tetrarchs are the-- the rulers of this particular place.
-AIMEE-
Whoa.
-ANJALI-
These obviously are not ancient ruins, but the city was lost a long, long time ago.
It was necessary for their own survival to conceal themselves from the outside eye.
But occasionally they would open one eye to see if perhaps there were any worthy visitors.
Worthy of seeing, worthy of visiting.
Worthy of the other gifts they may bestow on them.
Knowledge, friendship, kindness.
-LIAM-
And they've remained hidden using the mists we're seeing? Or is it more than that?
-ANJALI-
There are certain things <i>I</i> cannot explain to you.
One can only feel.
All I can say is that this place is known to the beings it wants to be known to.
-AIMEE-
Hmm.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right.
Don't follow, but respect it.
-ANJALI-
I came here when I-- when I heard of my sister's death.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-ANJALI-
I lost my way.
I lost my purpose and, somehow, I was guided here.
Here is where I found myself.
Thanks to them.
I will tell you more when we meet another friend.
-AABRIA-
Orym, with your passive perception, you hear whispers in a language that you don't understand coming from almost over your head, because remember this is a multi-story building.
So there's a whole little outcropping on this patio.
-LIAM-
Do they have a tone to them?
-AABRIA-
It is soft and very high-pitched, someone quiet or someone young.
-LIAM-
Okay, so young. Got it.
Okay.
No alarm or anything to it, right?
-AABRIA-
Nope.
-LIAM-
Okay.
Well.
-ASHLEY-
So this city was-- if it was lost, how was it found? Was it--?
-ANJALI-
Do you remember your experience in the jungle? With the goddess?
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm.
-ANJALI-
She allowed us to come here.
She allowed me ages ago.
Now she has allowed you.
-LIAM-
So we didn't find it per se, we were let in.
-ANJALI-
As I say, the place is known to those it wishes to be known to.
-LIAM-
That's what I said.
-AIMEE-
VIP.
We're VIP.
-ANJALI-
You proved yourselves to be worthy of heart, of purpose, of kindness.
And perhaps they have other ideas for you, too.
-MATT-
And sense of humor, probably.
-AABRIA-
You all smell this frying, sizzling vegetables.
You all smell this frying, sizzling vegetables.
And then you all hear a shout as that smell turns a little acrid.
-ANJALI-
Oh no.
-AABRIA-
She's started burning food a little bit.
-AIMEE-
Oh no!
-AABRIA-
Rolled low.
You can hear it and then you start to smell it, like uh-oh.
-ANJALI-
So, I'm going to get up and: Excuse me for a moment.
Please, rest.
And I'm going to go check on her.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you come down and you see that she's got this massive fry surface going.
And she is just-- there's some fry bread going and you can see little black spots going where she's like, "It got too hot too fucking fast.
What? What are you doing? No, why are you here?"
-ANJALI-
I'm here to see if you need help.
-AABRIA-
"Don't look at me."
-ANJALI-
Do you need help?
-AABRIA-
"No, I'm nervous.
I've never-- you're the last person from outside the walls that any-- this whole neighborhood has seen.
And I don't-- What-- What if they don't like the food?"
-ANJALI-
I don't think you have to worry about the food.
They will love your hospitality.
-MATT-
Man, that sounds and smells really good.
-AABRIA-
"What is he saying?"
-ANJALI-
He's saying it smells delicious.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, they don't know better then, okay.
I'm less worried now." And you see her pop a big bubble of dough.
As it goes back down and continues to fry.
(sounds of hunger)
-ANJALI-
Genar.
-LIAM-
Sourdough.
-ANJALI-
There is something special about them indeed.
And they do wish to bring them to the Tetrarchs.
How have things been since I have left?
-AABRIA-
You see a little wash of concern on her face and she quickly fights it down.
"Well, there are rumors that bad omens were seen.
They haven't said anything officially out loud, but Ruidus is out and a dark moon is a dark omen." "but Ruidus is out and a dark moon is a dark omen."
-ANJALI-
No specifics, nothing more?
-AABRIA-
Nothing <i>official</i> has been said.
-ANJALI-
And you said what is-- a notice is out?
-AABRIA-
"Ruidus."
-ANJALI-
Ruidus.
-AABRIA-
Which you'll know is the second moon, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
Ruidus.
-AABRIA-
Ruidus, I'll say it right. It's fine.
-ANJALI-
I have an accent.
Have you not noticed?
-AABRIA-
No, I do, too.
-ANJALI-
Have you not noticed this completely unplacable accent is mine?
-AABRIA-
I am matching it for reasons unknown.
-ANJALI-
I am from another world that no one knows!
-AABRIA-
Okay, this is fine.
-ANJALI-
(laughs) You got this.
But everyone here has been safe.
No rumblings among the Tetrarchy?
-AABRIA-
"That is not quite true.
One of the Tetrarchs has gone south over the Beynsfal."
-ANJALI-
Over the?
-AABRIA-
"The Beynsfal Plateau is to the south.
To see if maybe the Iron Authority is a thing to be concerned about.
But once again, I don't know anything.
So you'll have to talk to the Tetrarchs."
-ANJALI-
Of course.
-AABRIA-
"And if you're down here, I'm going to make you work." And she puts a massive spoon in your hand.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
-AABRIA-
"Those vegetables, do not let them burn like I have let this fucking bread burn."
-ANJALI-
Excellent, and I'll just heave into it.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
I love this work.
-AABRIA-
And she's got those Teflon hands where she's just reaching onto the griddle and pulling bread off.
-ANJALI-
Reminds me of home.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. (laughs) And she tears it up and she's like, "Okay, I'm going to give them the bread.
And then I'll make a better bread.
Don't tell them." And yeah, she's going to appear up the stairs and leave you down to do a little more work while she comes back up with this massive, shallow basket piled high with torn fried bread.
"Hello.
Oh, is he being a good boy?"
-ASHLEY-
Very.
-AIMEE-
The best boy.
-MATT-
Almost the worst boy.
-AIMEE-
No, no, no, no.
-MATT-
But kept him the best boy.
-AABRIA-
"Okay, I don't know what that means."
-MATT-
I don't either.
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah, please.
Oh, okay. Go ahead, go ahead."
-LIAM-
Thank you very much.
It's appreciated.
-AABRIA-
"So you traveled from what part of--?"
-LIAM-
Oh boy, all over.
-ASHLEY-
All over, yeah.
-LIAM-
Pretty far north.
-AABRIA-
"In Gwessar?"
-LIAM-
Emon.
-AABRIA-
"Emon, Emon, I don't know."
-AIMEE-
Are you immortal? Are you, like, a hundred years old? You don't look it, I just was wondering.
Do people age here?
Is that rude?
-AABRIA-
"Are you simple? No, I am not immortal."
-AIMEE-
Oh, oh, oh.
-ROBBIE-
I think our friend thinks that because the city is ancient and hidden, perhaps its inhabitants are also ancient, hidden, and immortal.
Is that what you're saying?
-AIMEE-
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AABRIA-
"Although, elves get very old.
But I think that is true everywhere?"
-LIAM-
Yes, it is.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
You're a earth genasi, correct?
-AABRIA-
"I am.
You're an air genasi, yes?"
-ROBBIE-
Yes, I beg your pardon.
I've actually never met one before.
Not one, that sounds wrong.
You know what I mean? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
"I know what you mean.
Fy'ra Rai had much the same reaction when she was first here, but there's actually a sizeable genasi population here."
-ROBBIE-
Really?
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-ROBBIE-
Air genasi as well?
-AABRIA-
"Yes.
Oh, sweet boy, how long have you been without your people?"
-ROBBIE-
A while.
A year.
But it's nice to see you all living here together, everyone.
It's beautiful, really.
-AABRIA-
"We are a little removed from time, and long before the Calamity, our people-- the planes touched.
We roamed everywhere across Exandria."
-ROBBIE-
Some still do.
Dariax, the paper?
-AIMEE-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Oh, right, right.
Hold on just a second.
His fingers are greasy and just leaving tracks on them.
-AABRIA-
She looks horrified as you do that, by the way.
"You are very dirty."
-MATT-
He's got crumbled bits of the bread in his chin beard.
All right, all right, here.
-AABRIA-
"Is the world outside the wall so barbaric that you do not have a thing for your hands for cloth to--"
-AIMEE-
That's just him.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, okay."
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
-MATT-
There you go.
This is delicious, by the way.
Thank you so much.
-AABRIA-
"This is the bread.
There's more food.
That's-- okay."
-MATT-
I love this place.
Thank you so much for taking us here.
-ANJALI-
You're welcome! Still stirring.
-AABRIA-
"You can bring that up whenever you think it's ready, but don't make me look bad."
-LIAM-
Never fill up on the bread.
-MATT-
Why?
-LIAM-
Keep going.
-AABRIA-
"What is this paper?"
-ROBBIE-
We have to ask you.
Do you recognize this symbol? And I hand you the paper.
-AABRIA-
So which one is this? Is this the writings from--
-ROBBIE-
This is the OG one rubbing from the ash hole.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Yeah. She looks at it and says, "Yes. It says 'place of burning.' Sorry. It doesn't translate quite right." And she begins to speak this.
Uh, does anyone here speak Celestial?
-MATT-
Nope.
-LIAM-
Nope.
-AIMEE-
No.
-AABRIA-
I didn't think so, but I wanted to double-check.
-MATT-
Barely speak Common.
-AABRIA-
Vibes. (laughs)
-AIMEE-
Wait, so it just says "place of burning"?
-AABRIA-
"No, I'm very sorry.
That is a rough understanding.
Okay, so you've never seen-- you don't see symbols like this, I assume, since you've brought this out for me.
Our language, this writing is older than the language of the gods and it is very much-- the drawing of it is also half of the meaning."
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
"So the visual is a place, a gate, and the word of it, the speaking of it is a burning flow and energy.
So a place of burning? Where did you see this? In a book?"
-LIAM-
In a place that was burning.
-AIMEE-
Yeah. I mean it seems a little--
-LIAM-
It was a problem.
It was a large chunk of the earth bulged into the sky where it hadn't before and the place was covered in ash and you could barely see or breathe.
And we found that symbol at the heart of it all.
-AABRIA-
"Was it carved by someone or did it erupt on its own?"
-MATT-
I mean, from what we saw, it just kind of happened.
-AIMEE-
Well, it was already there when we got there, like the symbol was there.
-MATT-
Right. But the mountain wasn't.
-AIMEE-
No, no.
-LIAM-
That erupted from the earth.
-MATT-
Craziest thing.
-AIMEE-
Earthquake, mesa.
-MATT-
Yeah.
These gardens are beautiful, by the way.
This whole place is great.
I've been camping out the wrong spots in Tal'Dorei, let me tell you.
-ANJALI-
I'll come up with the--
-AABRIA-
"Tal'Dorei. Tal'Dorei?"
-MATT-
Tal'Dorei.
-AABRIA-
"What's Tal'Dorei? What's a Tal'Dorei?"
-MATT-
It's...
Wow. That's a bigger question, now I think about it.
What is a Tal'Dorei?
-AIMEE-
It's the biggest city--
-LIAM-
From our corner of the world where we live and here are considered Tal'Dorei.
-AIMEE-
Oh. I was confused.
-ANJALI-
I'll come up with the vat of vegetables.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
"So what do you mean? Is that north or south of Gwessar?"
-AIMEE-
We're on Tal'Dorei.
-LIAM-
It's the continent.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
"Hmm. Names change."
-AIMEE-
This is what I mean.
How old are you?
-AABRIA-
"I am-- Okay. I don't like-- I am 45 and I'm very sensitive about it."
-LIAM-
You look great.
-AIMEE-
You look way younger.
-AABRIA-
"Thank you."
-AIMEE-
Just saying.
-AABRIA-
"Thank you.
You--" and she begins to start serving and she'll serve you first.
And she just dumps this big melange of night-shade veggies, tomato-y, dark green potatoes and onions onto a big piece of the bread and just hands it to you.
"You're nice. You're making me uncomfortable."
-AIMEE-
No, you look great!
-AABRIA-
"You're very pretty, though.
Thank you, thank you, thank you."
-AIMEE-
Drop the skincare routine.
-AABRIA-
"I barely have skin.
It's kind of like a rock.
Don't worry about it."
-ROBBIE-
Whatever it is. it don't crack.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
"All right. You next."
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
Extra high.
"The names change over time.
We live and die as I'm assuming everyone else does throughout the world.
But in the time before, during the Calamity, when we dropped off of the face of...
Tal'Dorei--"
-AIMEE-
What was it called then?
-AABRIA-
"Gwessar. That's not our word.
There are elves to the north that called it that."
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah. We met them, they're in purple.
-AABRIA-
"Okay. Are they--"
-AIMEE-
I mean, I gave one of them attitude. It was fine.
-AABRIA-
"I don't-- There is some subtext I feel like I am missing in translation?"
-AIMEE-
Tell us about-- Why did it just erupt and then have the signal? What is it supposed to be saying to the people that see the signal? "Place of burning"? What does that mean to you? Don't go in?
-MATT-
Yeah, is it a warning? Is it more of a statement? Is it a symbol of power that could bring places of burning forward?
-AABRIA-
"Fy'ra Rai, did you tell them that I am, like, a scholar or something?"
-ANJALI-
I did not, but I will say I think this may be a question for Umejii.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah. This is a little above my-- Terra-- What's the word for-- a terrace? This is more than--"
-MATT-
The flavor of this meal says you're some kind of a wizard to me.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, thank you."
-ANJALI-
I brought you here, my friends, for sustenance.
For knowledge, we will be moving somewhere else.
-AIMEE-
Got it.
-ANJALI-
They have a larger purpose, but they needed the greatest sustenance that could be offered to them to complete their task.
-AIMEE-
So delish.
-AABRIA-
"You all are very sweet."
-ROBBIE-
But you were very helpful.
Thank you for telling us about the symbol.
-AABRIA-
"Yes. I'm sorry I could not be a little more helpful for you."
-LIAM-
I think this is a pretty big shock to the system.
It's good that we take it in gradually.
-MATT-
Yeah.
And your hospitality will be remembered.
-AABRIA-
"Thank you.
If you do not have other accommodations, I'm assuming you're here for a while? Given how long it probably took you to get here.
You are most welcome in my house."
-LIAM-
That is very kind of you.
-ASHLEY-
That is very nice of you.
-AIMEE-
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
"Now what are any of your names?" (laughter)
-ANJALI-
I am the worst host and you are the best host.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, thank you.
I'm not going to disagree with you." (laughter)
-ANJALI-
Dariax.
-MATT-
Hey, Dariax.
-ANJALI-
This is young Opal.
-AIMEE-
Hi!
-AABRIA-
"Like the stone?"
-AIMEE-
Yeah, like the stone.
-AABRIA-
"That's a lovely necklace."
-AIMEE-
Thank you.
-ANJALI-
Dorian Storm.
-ROBBIE-
Hello.
-AABRIA-
"Dorian Storm?"
-ROBBIE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
"Fy'ra Rai.
Dorian Storm."
-ROBBIE-
Very cool, isn't it?
-MATT-
It's pretty cool.
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
I'm a musician. So.
It's more of a stage name, really, but yeah.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, okay. That's fine.
What is your real name? You cannot come into my house and eat my food without me knowing your name."
-AIMEE-
Yeah, what is your real name? I want to know.
-ASHLEY-
We've been calling you by a fake name this whole time?
-ROBBIE-
For all intents and purposes.
-AABRIA-
"Oh!"
-ROBBIE-
It is--
-AABRIA-
She begins shoveling food in her face, having inadvertently caused a thing.
-ROBBIE-
It's Dorian Storm.
That's who I am. That is who I am.
-AIMEE-
You said a stage name.
-ROBBIE-
Yes, it's a stage name.
-AIMEE-
What's the off-stage name?
-ROBBIE-
The off-stage name?
-MATT-
You have an off-stage name?
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) I-- I left it behind when I left home and--
-LIAM-
We'll still call you Dorian.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, we'll still call you Dorian.
We'll tell you something embarrassing about everybody.
-ROBBIE-
Really?
-AIMEE-
Yeah! My real name's not Opal.
-ROBBIE-
Deception check.
Can I do that to myself to tell if she's lying to me or not?
-AABRIA-
That's insight, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Insight, all right.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Do I roll, too?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-LIAM-
If you're lying, yeah.
-AIMEE-
I'm not!
-LIAM-
Then persuasion for you.
-ROBBIE-
Insight is 19.
-AABRIA-
Ooh!
-AIMEE-
Persua-- 16.
But this is-- I'm telling the truth.
I'll tell you something embarrassing.
-ROBBIE-
First name only.
Oh, you're telling the truth. Oh yeah, okay.
-AABRIA-
"Hold on.
If we're doing uncomfortable truths, I will bring alcohol, yes?"
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-AABRIA-
"Is the word?"
-ROBBIE-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, great.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, applause!"
-ANJALI-
Keep your wits about you because we still do need to go to the Tetrarchs."
-ROBBIE-
Yes, yes, yes.
-AABRIA-
"You are a buzzkill!"
-ANJALI-
I always have been.
-MATT-
These are really important people, right? Heads of the city or whatever?
-AIMEE-
The titty racks.
-MATT-
The titty racks.
Before we see the titty racks, I'm going to need at least two shots.
So yeah, I'm down.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-LIAM-
The best of the dinosaurs.
-AABRIA-
She comes back with this big, bulbous--
-MATT-
The arms are a little closer in.
-AABRIA-
-- clay pot and pours out a very milky-- it basically tastes like sake.
Don't know why that's in my head.
-ANJALI-
I can't imagine why.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Ooh, that's yummy.
-AABRIA-
Pours some out for all of you.
-MATT-
Dariax doesn't hand her his cup, he hands the bowl.
And she's trying to move it, and he's trying to guide the bowl.
(laughter) All right, fine, fine. I'll have a cup, then, I guess.
-AABRIA-
"Okay, okay, okay."
-MATT-
Take it slow.
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Like this one.
Sorry. Continue with your truths that I am learning now."
-ROBBIE-
So we all have drinks.
Is that right now? We all have them?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ROBBIE-
Ahem.
All right. A promise is a promise.
First name only.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
And I get one deep dark secret about each of you, even you, even you.
-AABRIA-
"Me?"
-ROBBIE-
Deal?
-AABRIA-
"Okay!"
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-AABRIA-
"I have no secrets.
I have so many secrets, but I could lie."
-ROBBIE-
My real first name-- and you must promise to continue to call me Dorian--
-LIAM-
Of course.
-ROBBIE-
-- is...
Bronte.
And my mother calls me Bron.
-AIMEE-
It's not the worst name!
-AABRIA-
"That makes more sense as a name."
-ANJALI-
I don't understand why this is a problem.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, that's a nice name.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
First name only.
And since you're so keen to talk, you first.
What is your dark and dirty secret?
-AABRIA-
"Ooh, yes."
-ANJALI-
I don't know about dark and dirty.
There's not much about me that is dark and dirty.
-AABRIA-
"That's not true."
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
This one, I believe.
Fine, something fun.
-ANJALI-
There was that one time with my sister, my sister Fy'ra Kai.
Always getting herself into trouble and getting me into trouble with our parents, too.
When we were much younger, not even here, not on Tal'Dorei, but back home.
It was just slightly before we left.
We were climbing this-- I don't know how to say it in Common, but climbing this fiery outcropping back home.
And she was more agile than me.
Yes, I know.
I know, it is surprising, but she was always better than me at so many things.
She was climbing this outcropping and suddenly she lost her footing and she fell and I tried to catch her.
And when I caught her, she knocked me over, along with her.
And I broke my arm.
We went back to my parents and I was gritting my teeth.
And she was sobbing.
Sobbing because she knew she would be the one to get in trouble.
So when we went back to my parents, I told them immediately that I had been climbing a fiery outcropping and I fell and broke my arm.
-AIMEE-
You lied.
-ANJALI-
I lied.
My little sister received no punishment.
I, on the other hand, I definitely did.
The dark secret about that is I think she never actually forgave me for that.
She hated that I took the credit and the responsibility for something that she had done.
Anytime I tried to protect her after that, she would not let me.
Including when we came to this plane and despite the protections, the magic and the love that my mother had given us, she would not let the best protection stay with her.
Which was me.
-AIMEE-
Well, I can understand her-- I can understand where she's coming from.
-ANJALI-
This is why I understand your sister.
-ROBBIE-
Well, Fy, only you can turn a drinking game into a parable.
-AABRIA-
"That!"
-ROBBIE-
What?
-AABRIA-
"No, I agree with you."
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Thought we were going to say spicier things," and she takes a shot of her drink and goes, "Tetrarch Umejii stayed with me before she left for the south." (clicks tongue)
-ANJALI-
Really?
-AABRIA-
"Yes. None of you know what that means, but I know you know what that means."
-MATT-
Wow, I mean--
-AABRIA-
"Thank you, thank you!"
-MATT-
I have no idea.
-AABRIA-
"Oh."
"Drink more."
-LIAM-
Some things transcend language.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
"Okay, someone else go.
What is your name?"
-LIAM-
After finishing his drink.
My name is Orym.
Orym of the Air Ashari.
I don't have a last name.
Although, I sort of do, sort of.
Didn't really have a dad in life.
I did have a dad, but he just kind of rolled on.
His name, last name was Tarrintel.
So I sort of have a last name.
I don't really use it.
But if you want saltier, I might have checked out Dariax's butt out in the swimming hole and it wasn't half bad.
-AABRIA-
"Who's Dar--"
-MATT-
Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
Worked hard to get that apple popping.
-AABRIA-
And she happily refills your drink at whatever level it's at currently.
-LIAM-
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
"That's a good answer.
So you, beautiful-- What are you?"
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I'm a faun.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, lovely."
-ASHLEY-
My name is Fearne.
-AABRIA-
"Fearne."
"Who's that?"
-ASHLEY-
Oh, this is Mister.
-AABRIA-
"Hello, Mister."
-ASHLEY-
We met him in, um...
a fire crater and I pulled him out of the ground.
And he's my monkey now.
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
"Did that translate right?"
-ANJALI-
It did, from everything I can understand.
-AABRIA-
"Okay. Sure."
-ANJALI-
I have not been with them for all of their travels.
-ROBBIE-
Is there any of that fry bread? Do the thing, make it here.
If maybe he can eat something.
Show her, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Take a little piece of the fry bread and throw in the air so he can--
-AABRIA-
What do you want him to do? Yeah, do you want him to just like-- yeah.
I'm going to make you roll for it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
This is a coordinated effort.
So give me an acrobatics check.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Oh no.
That is not very good.
That's a six.
He has performance anxiety.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
You toss the bread and he gives that belch a little too soon and it just goes in the air.
And then the bread just lands in his open mouth.
He's like--
-ANJALI-
Oh, that's really cute.
-ASHLEY-
This is the first time he's had to perform for somebody, so.
-AABRIA-
"You don't have to perform.
That's terrifying, I like it.
You're a very nice Mister."
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Boy, I don't know if I have any secrets.
I'm a bit of an open book, but I guess...
I haven't seen my parents in a really long time.
They left probably...
50 years ago, I guess.
-AABRIA-
"And you asked me if <i>I'm</i> immortal? She looks like she's 20.
How old are you?"
-ASHLEY-
Oh, we live a very long time.
-AABRIA-
"And you asked me if <i>I'm</i> immortal! Rude."
-LIAM-
How old are you again?
-ASHLEY-
I'm 112.
But we live-- fauns live for--
-LIAM-
Right, right, right.
-ASHLEY-
I don't know.
I think hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.
-AABRIA-
"Amazing."
-ASHLEY-
You know.
-AABRIA-
"Oh yeah, like you do.
Just be-- live forever.
Be a cute little faun with the little fur and the little fire boy.
Totally normal, yes."
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
So nothing embarrassing.
Nothing at faun school.
Nothing you've done that made you blush underneath your fur, ever?
-LIAM-
She did poop in front of all of us.
-ROBBIE-
I know.
Maybe that doesn't make her blush.
-ASHLEY-
It doesn't make me blush.
Let me think about it.
I can't think of anything embarrassing.
Dariax?
-MATT-
I don't know anything embarrassing about you.
-ASHLEY-
No, I mean, what's your secret?
-MATT-
Oh, uh... (nervous laugh) I mean, like you, I'm a pretty open book.
Not a lot of hidden shades in the past of old Dariax.
-AABRIA-
I would like to roll an insight check, please.
-MATT-
Yeah, go for it.
-AABRIA-
I only got a 10.
-MATT-
That's all right, he got...
he got a 10.
-AABRIA-
All right, you're good.
She just looks at you.
"Okay."
-MATT-
Uh, well.
Here, I'll-- Let's just say, when I-- When I mentioned that me and Tharla started dating for a while in Kymal, maybe it was a-- we didn't like-- It wasn't like a-- we weren't-- She doesn't know who I am.
I was just a big fan of her work.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-ROBBIE-
No.
You don't know her at all?
-MATT-
Well, I mean, I'd go see her perform and stuff but you know, every time I try and say hi, I just kind of froze up.
It's the one time that's really happened, you know? I usually don't have anything to stop me to an honest detriment.
Not most of the time, but for some reason, it just kept-- kept freezing me. I don't know.
So, so I lied.
Sorry. Kind of embarrassing.
Anyway. Opal. What's going on with you? You, you got some, well, you ate your sister, right.
We already went over that.
-AABRIA-
"What?!"
-AIMEE-
I didn't eat her.
She just found her way in without asking.
I have an embarrassing story.
So Ted's real name is actually Theodora. (giggles)
-MATT-
That's pretty.
-ANJALI-
That's not a story about you.
-AABRIA-
"What's a Ted? You keep going.
I don't know what's happening.
I'm just happy to be here."
-ROBBIE-
For once--
-ANJALI-
That is her sister.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, a story about you, about Opal.
Sans Ted, something about Opal.
-AIMEE-
I've never done anything without Ted.
I've never done anything without Ted, except...
leave home and join you guys.
But even that I'm not doing alone.
So, I don't know.
I changed my name, too, actually.
-AABRIA-
"Do all of you have lies for names? Why is that?"
-AIMEE-
Yes, because you, well, wait for it, okay? So my mom left before I could even know who she was, but she named me Georgina. Georgina and Theodora.
So I made my dad change my name to Opal because I hated it.
And I hated her. (giggles) So, cheers.
-AABRIA-
"That one was sad and I don't like it."
-ROBBIE-
Well, I'll still always call you Opal.
-AIMEE-
Thanks, I'll call you Dorian.
-ROBBIE-
Thank you.
-AIMEE-
'Til I call you Bron.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, s-- All right, Georgie Porgie.
-AIMEE-
(gasps) That's rude.
-LIAM-
This is the tensest our group has ever gotten.
That's not true.
-AIMEE-
That's not true! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
"All right, all right."
-ANJALI-
Fy'ra's just trying to read the room and decide whether she opens her mouth again to say something else and share something else.
But she feels like perhaps it's become a little bit more tense than fun.
So she...
She lets it go.
-AABRIA-
Genar is going to make eye contact with you and just give you a little nod.
"Okay, that's enough of hospitality from me.
You need to go speak to people who understand mountains with runes on them.
And then you can come back here and drink my alcohol and be weird at each other as much as you want."
-MATT-
Plenty of that, sounds great.
-AIMEE-
Titty racks?
-AABRIA-
"What are you saying?"
-ANJALI-
Opal, this joke will not be funny to the tetrarchs.
Be respectful.
-AABRIA-
"Are you saying tetrarch funny?"
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
"What's titty rack?"
-ANJALI-
You don't want to know.
-AABRIA-
"No, you don't tell me how I want.
What is titty rack?"
-AIMEE-
It's a rack.
But it's extra funny because it's--
-ASHLEY-
Like a double rack.
-AIMEE-
Double rack.
Titty rack.
-ASHLEY-
It's a redundancy a little bit, yeah.
-LIAM-
Wordplay.
-AABRIA-
"Oh!"
-AIMEE-
Titty rack.
-AABRIA-
"Okay."
-AIMEE-
She thought it was funny.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah. I think it's funny, but I'm drunk.
So follow me, come on.
Or are you going to take them? I'll stay here and clean the house."
-ANJALI-
I will take them and leave what you can for later.
And I will do it when we come.
-AABRIA-
"See, this is what happens.
I throw a little fit and then she does everything for me."
-ROBBIE-
So we're going to see the most powerful beings in this ancient, mystical city, a little bit tipsy?
-MATT-
Like I said--
-AABRIA-
"Powerful beings?"
-MATT-
No better way--
-AABRIA-
"No, no, no, no, no, not-- they're just the leaders.
They're just people.
What's wrong?"
-ANJALI-
Just remember please, respectful.
-ROBBIE-
Respect the titty racks.
-ASHLEY-
Always.
-AABRIA-
"We cannot c-- (laughs) You can call them whatever you want."
-AIMEE-
So are they elected leaders of this place?
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
"So-- oh, I can give-- okay.
Here's a thing that I know and I can tell you.
So long ago when we were more than just Niirdal-Poc, this was the capital city, but not the only city here.
The Qoniira Tetrarchy was five cities.
One to the north, one to the south, one to the east, to the west and we were at the center.
And-- actually, night is falling.
So maybe we can see--" and she leans and walks a couple steps through the garden to get from the overhang, to look up into the night sky.
And before she can point, she just screams and you see her reach down, grab a clod of dirt and throw it up.
And you hear it connects with something and you hear giggles as children scream.
She's goes, "These fucking children, always.
How long were you hanging--? It doesn't matter.
All of that can be explained by a different tetrarch.
But we were a powerful widespread civilization that is only here now.
But the Qoniira, we have four leaders, tetrarchs.
One at each of the cities on the peripheral.
And they would come here whenever they needed to make group decisions.
Everything else was held by one of them.
But they're all here now because we're all that's left."
-ANJALI-
You did mention that someone had gone south.
Which of the tetrarchs has left?
-AABRIA-
"Umejii."
-ANJALI-
What?
-AABRIA-
"She's gone to go see if perhaps the Iron Authority is-- once again, none of this is official.
So don't go running your mouths."
-ANJALI-
But I came here to see her.
I was taking them to see her.
-AABRIA-
"I'm sorry.
She's been gone now for a week."
-MATT-
That's fine, right? We can just go ahead and head to the Iron Authority, then, wherever that is.
-AABRIA-
"No, don't-- no." "(laughs) No."
-AIMEE-
What's the Iron Authority?
-AABRIA-
"Oh god, oh.
It's a whole...
to the south.
There are others, much like Tal'Dorei to the north and your civil society.
There are societies to the south that know only war.
That follow the-- do you still call them Betrayer Gods?"
-MATT-
Yeah.
That's a phrase that's used.
-AABRIA-
"Okay. Much more in their thrall.
Would not recommend it unless you are looking to start or finish a war."
-ANJALI-
So she has put herself in danger.
-AABRIA-
"You two have that in common."
-ANJALI-
Then let's go quickly to see the other tetrarchs.
I must know more.
-MATT-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
"Okay, goodbye, um--"
-ANJALI-
Thank you. We will be back.
-AABRIA-
"We'll see you later." And she grabs you by the shoulders and kisses you on the forehead and then leads you out to the front door.
-ANJALI-
I give a quick little snuggle to Googal.
-AABRIA-
Googal has just been eating all of the bits of food that have fallen off because there's not a lot of plates.
So he has put himself in a food coma, just getting the leavings and has just fallen asleep.
-AIMEE-
He deserves it.
-AABRIA-
And as you guys get back out onto the streets it's that last couple of minutes of twilight before it goes fully dark and the fog has gotten much thicker and the air is pushed through with this hazy, gray, golden glow and you lead them toward it in its direction, until you finally reach the main plaza of Niirdal-Poc.
And standing at the center of it is this massive, 40-foot high statue of a feline humanoid with a really serene face looking into her own clutched hand, holding that gray gold light that seems to be diffused out and everywhere.
And there's this shattered halo of light around it.
And from her back springs four large feathery wings.
You recognize this as a statue of The Observer.
-ANJALI-
I do.
And before I say anything, I look up.
I put my hands to my chest and I go to The Gift to see if I can see anything about Tetrarch Umejii.
-AABRIA-
Make a wisdom saving throw for me.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, no.
-AABRIA-
You can't seem to still your heart and your mind enough to look inward.
But Dariax, I need you to make a charisma saving throw.
-MATT-
Yeah, totally.
Yeah, why not.
Nine.
-AABRIA-
You feel suddenly-- not sickened, but dizzy and overwhelmed.
And both of you close your eyes in unison.
You going to look and trying to calm your mind and Dariax as you lean over, eyes turn to you and you see that, that pendant that you wear, that compass is glowing with the same gray gold light.
And that's where we're going to take our break.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, the plot thickens.
-MATT-
Intrigue!
-AABRIA-
All right. We will return in a couple of minutes.
Stay tuned.
I never know what to do here.
I hope you leave this in the cut.
Just my full panic confusion.
(laughter) Goodbye, we'll be back! Narrator: Cubeamajig are reusable gaming packs that recreate the experience of opening a sealed pack of cards.
Additionally, they are an efficient way to organize a signboard or collection.
Cubeamajig series two makes a few improvements, for starters, no more building the packs.
They come preassembled.
Each box includes 10 Cubeamajig gaming packs.
Also the outer box can be reused to store 400 cards.
There are over 30 pieces of gorgeous art by your favorite MTG artists.
Now, if only there was a storage solution for all of these gaming packs.
Well, the wait is over.
Say hello to the Potamajig.
Made for cube, commander, and card collections.
Potamajigs are a storage solution specifically crafted for the Cubeamajig.
A single Potamajig is ideal for 360 to 540 card cubes with an overall capacity over 1000 double sleeved cards.
Potamajigs can also hold nine double sleeved commander decks with spare room for tokens.
Starting with five amazing designs, more Potamajigs can be unlocked during the campaign.
Back Cubeamajig series two, today.
Laura: Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shops.
I mean, the Traveler always says impulse purchases on a good decision.
Roll an investigation if you want.
It's basically perfect.
(engine revving) You're only like five clicks away from owning this.
Maybe more, if you have a lot of windows open on your browser.
I don't know your life.
(liquid pouring) This is a lot of stuff, you guys.
We have like, so many cool things right now.
I mean, seriously, look at this thing.
So click on over to the Critical Roll shops.
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.
You've still got time.
-LIAM-
These episodes are just like the pure essence of the characters and what we did together.
-SAM-
It's a project unlike anything I've ever seen before.
-ASHLEY-
It's so weird that it's happening, but it's so cool.
-MATT-
I'm getting impatient for the final thing to get done, just so people can see it, and be as excited about it as we are.
-MATT-
As a person that has been a lifelong fan of cartoons, it's kind of been a dream to work on one from a production standpoint, let alone from a voiceover standpoint.
And now to kind of marry them all together, and have it be based on something that I kind of made up, is crazy.
-ARTHUR-
At end of the day, the creators of this property are professional voice actors.
And seeing them working on their own disparate projects is cool, but seeing them all in one room together, it's so good.
-LIAM-
We are just a group of high-key nerds, but we also happen to be good at what we do.
It's like we're craftsmen who make tables, except we are great with voice work, and now just endless improv with each other.
-SAM-
Voice acting as a character that I created in a show that I helped create, it's both the end of a long voice acting journey, and also the beginning of a new voice acting journey.
-MATT-
Finding a director for this project was challenging, partially because we have very good directors as part of our cast who do phenomenal work.
But we all also understood that we wanted somebody outside of the room who could make us better than we could be on our own.
-TRAVIS-
It was a very short list, and at the top of it, of course, was our good friend, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
-MARISHA-
Beyond all of us just personally loving Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, you may remember her is Zahra back in Campaign One.
-LAURA-
On top of just coming and doing guest episodes for us, she actually watched the series.
She would text us during the game and be like, "Oh my god, I can't believe that just happened!" So she knows who our characters are and she knows where they're going.
-LIAM-
We didn't have to give her any kind of information download.
She knows it and is part of it.
-TRAVIS-
It's been amazing watching her come into each one of the sessions, settle us down, get our minds in the right space for where the episode is.
And then just step back with her baton, and just start to conduct the symphony of idiots that's in there.
-SAM-
When we started this whole thing, playing tabletop around Matt's dining room table, we were all gathered together, the eight of us, in a room face-to-face.
And now recording the cartoon, we are all eight of us in a room together, and we are creating a story together, just us eight friends.
-ASHLEY-
Stepping into that booth the first time was obviously very, very exciting.
I think all of us were like: "Is this a joke?" "Is someone pulling a prank on us?" (laughs)
-LAURA-
We were giddy, giddy with excitement.
-SAM-
The energy in the room when we're recording is just like it was in those early days when we were making each other laugh, cracking each other up, laughing at each other's mistakes and flubs.
-TALIESIN-
It's an interesting, strange mix between extremely professional and a very filthy preschool where everyone's swearing all the time. (laughs)
-LAURA-
You know, we've all been in the booth with each other in various ways in the past, anyway.
But it's so different when it's something that you've created.
-TALIESIN-
I've never been part of a show where the main cast were also more or less producers.
So we have an intense amount of control with what happens.
-LAURA-
Mary is so in tune with the actors.
-MARISHA-
She knows exactly how to get us out of the comfort zones of our character, which I think is important.
We know these characters so well that I think sometimes that can get in our own way.
-MATT-
Having her ideas, and her overall creative view, and lathering that in with ours, has helped us elevate our performances, and bring it to the best version of it it can be.
-ALL-
(yelling)
-TRAVIS-
Not all animation allows actors to record in group settings, but it invariably gives a more nuanced performance, and also provides a better opportunity for chemistry to happen in the group.
-LIAM-
We'd all been imagining it, and it was just as much fun, and inspiring, and beautiful a thing as we thought it would be.
-TALIESIN-
That was just the greatest thing ever.
And we got to do it a couple times.
-TALIESIN-
And then everything, of course, fell apart everywhere.
-LIAM-
Okay, so this is where I have been doing my twinning.
-LAURA-
Recording studio.
This is legit.
-ASHLEY-
This is where the magic happens.
-TRAVIS-
We found that we quickly had to go remote just like everyone else.
-TRAVIS-
For us on the voiceover side, we were partially prepared for that.
Most of us have some kind of a rig set up at home so that we can audition.
-LIAM-
I mean, I personally had put off trying to make a good home booth for myself for years, but then suddenly the world shut down.
And it's funny what a little panic will do as an incentive.
-MATT-
I had to completely re-overhaul my office in the period of a couple of weeks to make it a studio.
-TRAVIS-
We tried to find the area of our house that was most insulated, something that didn't share an exterior wall.
And for us, that was our closet in our bedroom.
It already works because most of the clothes in your closet act as a natural dampener.
-MARISHA-
Once more into the darkness.
It was definitely hard not to feel concerned that we might be losing a piece of the magic by having to switch to a remote recording session.
-MATT-
I really miss being able to do it all together.
But thankfully, a lot of us came up in video games, so we're used to the solo recording experience.
And a lot of us can still deliver at the top of our game without having other people there to play off of.
-SAM-
We record each individual actor from home.
Usually one at a time, but sometimes two or three people can record together via the magic of online communication.
-MARISHA-
So if there are scenes where you really want that more conversational dynamic between two actors, we've done sessions where Liam will stay on the Zoom call with me.
And he is reading his lines.
That way Keyleth sounds the most genuine in her response to him.
-ASHLEY-
Even though we're separate, there are some positives to it.
-SAM-
Since we're recording individually, remotely from different locations, we can talk over each other all we want.
And it's getting picked up on two separate mics, and the audio is totally clean.
-ASHLEY-
You can have a little bit more of a natural read, almost.
-LIAM-
(as Vax) What did I say? It's not like I suggested we take a bath together or something.
-LAURA-
(as Vex) What?!
-SAM-
The other thing it sort of affords us, is we get to go back and fix anything that we think is bad.
So, like, Liam will watch an episode of the show and be like, "Ooh, I wish I could redo that line." And we're like, "Hey, guess what? You can! You own a microphone, go record it."
-MARISHA-
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, because I can potentially spend 10 minutes on a single line doing 15 takes because I just want to make sure that it's perfect.
And we're always our own worst critic.
-SAM-
It's turned a lot of really good scenes into excellent scenes.
-ASHLEY-
We've all been forced to readjust, but we've all taken that challenge.
-TALIESIN-
Normally in a project like this, you're kind of in the dark about things, but we all know what we're doing, what everybody else is capable of.
-SAM-
It also helps that we've played these characters a zillion times.
-ASHLEY-
Performance-wise, I don't know if it has affected anything other than me just consciously knowing that I'm in a closet.
-LAURA-
It's weird to say, it doesn't feel that different.
-ASHLEY-
We've adjusted, because what else can you do?
-MATT-
Thankfully, we do still have table reads.
So we still get to like read it together before we record.
I kind of miss being able to go and engage with the development teams and the artists in person, and kind of have that around the table designer meetings throughout the week.
And it's all just Zoom screens now.
-TRAVIS-
I think one of the most rewarding things for us has been casting and recording these characters that we have enjoyed and loved coming out of Matthew Mercer's mouth.
But obviously, because of reasons, we need to find new voices for them.
-MATT-
I still want to hold onto some characters that I feel a connection with.
So I am excited to be coming in as Sylas Briarwood.
Beyond that, popping up here and there as all sorts of random characters and NPCs in the world.
-TALIESIN-
There will definitely be some voices you will not be surprised to hear.
Can't talk about so many things yet, but it's going to be great. (laughs)
-SAM-
When it comes right down to it, we love acting with our voices, whether it's in radio commercials, or video games, or our own animated series.
So you can bet that we put our heart and soul into every recording of every line.
-LIAM-
It's crazy that we've got to make this amazing show, that I cannot wait for people to see, in little pods all by ourself.
-TALIESIN-
It's still coming together, just much more slowly.
And it still sounds so good.
-TRAVIS-
The epic level of this show, I think is going to blow people away.
It was what we were hoping for.
And then we quickly realized that even we had to raise our level of expectation because we can.
-MATT-
We want this to be a love letter to all the people that supported us through all this time, and made all of this possible.
-ASHLEY-
I can't wait for people to see it, it's so cool.
-TRAVIS-
Everything that's being brought to the table, performance-wise, is going to level people.
-MATT-
There have been challenges, but I think we've all kind of risen to the task of making sure that it didn't prevent us from making this the best show we can make it.
-TRAVIS-
I know it's been a long wait for the fans.
Trust me, it's worth it.
(instrumental version of "Your Turn to Roll")
-AABRIA-
We're back.
And you made it, finally, to the truth, that the ruins that you were seeking was actually the city of Niirdal-Poc, buried, hidden, secret, within the center of the Rifenmist Peninsula.
You made your way through, you found a friend, and now the six of you stand in front of a massive statue known as The Observer, as Dariax has a bit of a moment.
Dariax.
Let's do this one more time.
Can I get a charisma saving throw from you?
-MATT-
Another one? Okay.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That's marginally better.
That's a 15.
-AABRIA-
You feel yourself swoon, but you're able to hold your consciousness within you.
As you look up and you cannot help but see this face, staring at the light within its hands, tilts down, ever so slightly, and regards you.
"Hello.
Are you okay?"
-MATT-
Hey. Maybe.
-AABRIA-
Her hand opens, releasing that light, and you see that shattered halo-- None of you see this.
You see that shattered halo fill itself back in valences of light, the same thing replicated on the pendant that you wear around your neck.
"You seem surprised to see me."
-MATT-
There's been a lot of people in my head recently.
It's a thing.
-AABRIA-
"I don't know what to tell you about all of that, but I want you to know that I like what you're doing, and you will continue to have my favor, should you need it."
-MATT-
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Who are you?
-AABRIA-
And her mouth opens, and there's a disconnect, because you see the lips forming words, but the sound you hear is, "I observe."
-MATT-
Okay.
Little creepy, but I appreciate the outreach.
-AABRIA-
"The Gift is strong with many, yourself included."
-MATT-
Okay.
Gift?
-AABRIA-
"My chosen are coming. They will explain more.
I just thought-- I didn't want to let this opportunity slide by without introducing myself."
-MATT-
No, I appreciate that.
It's been a lot. A lot kind of goes this way.
So the direct approach is very helpful.
Thank you, Observer.
-AABRIA-
And she reaches up and grabs that light again, shattering the halo and pulling you back to yourself, and you see her now, frozen in that statue pose.
-ASHLEY-
Who's this?
-ANJALI-
She is The Observer.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-ANJALI-
One who sees all and helps-- Helps others to see.
But for some reason, now I can't.
We must go.
Are you okay?
-MATT-
She's also pretty nice.
-ANJALI-
She spoke to you?
-MATT-
I mean, briefly.
It was a little weird.
Still kind of processing it.
Where are these--?
-ANJALI-
The Tetrarchs.
-MATT-
Yes. Thank you.
I wasn't going to say it again, because that would be rude.
-ANJALI-
Very wise of you, my friend.
-MATT-
I can also pay attention.
-ANJALI-
We move quickly.
-MATT-
Cool.
-AABRIA-
You know that this main civic hall is actually just on the far side of the plaza.
It faces this massive statue.
So you are essentially where you need to be.
And you see this massive edifice, once again of that same smooth, gray-green concrete, like a massive snifter of brandy, standing, bulbous, in the town plaza.
But in front of it are two massive, purple, porphyry statues of four-legged creatures that look like a panther on steroids, with three faces, one looking up, one looking down, and one looking out and away from the doors.
And over the top, that same runic writing.
-ANJALI-
Let me lead.
And please, do not speak, until I gesture it is okay, or until you are asked to.
-ROBBIE-
Deal.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, you got it.
-MATT-
Ahoy.
-ANJALI-
I lead them inside.
-AABRIA-
You push inside, and there's this massive reflecting pool of shallow water, that's lit with gentle, red flame.
And at the far end of the pool, that's about 40 feet in this massive hallway, that opens up gardens on the inside of the doors, you see a tall, elephantine person, with symbols of the crescent moon, and a smaller, redder moon at the center of their forehead, in long, flowing white robes, calmly regarding you, and gives you a nod immediately.
-ANJALI-
I bow and come forward.
Follow.
I come forward, and walk up to them.
And I kneel down before them, holding my wrist and my hand before my forehead.
And then I rise.
It's just good to see you, Tetrarch Thrascuur.
-AABRIA-
"You were well missed, Fy'ra Rai, and company?"
-ANJALI-
Yes. For many reasons, the jungle has seen fit to bring my friends to you, and I have brought them as well.
-AABRIA-
"Interesting.
Portents and omens.
But you are here now."
-ANJALI-
I have heard rumblings.
Is Umejii here?
-AABRIA-
They turn their head to the side, and you see them playing idly with a tusk that's been carved in this really ornate scrimshaw, and finished in silver filigree.
And eventually, "You've been here for so little time, and yet you've heard the most interesting things here.
She is not.
She has gone south."
-ANJALI-
Damn it.
-AABRIA-
"Peace."
-ANJALI-
Is she in danger?
-AABRIA-
"I wish that I could tell you that she was not, but I do not lie. Not about this.
You know as well as I do that where she goes, danger follows."
-ANJALI-
You know The Gift shows me where I am needed.
That the only reason I need it is to know where I am needed, so I never have to fail someone I love again.
-AABRIA-
"The Gift led you to them, and you led them here."
-ANJALI-
I did.
-AABRIA-
"Then take that as enough of a sign, and be at peace."
-ANJALI-
I am sorry.
You are right, of course, wise one.
-AABRIA-
"My name is Tetrarch Thrascuur.
I am one of the four leaders of what remains of the Qoniira Tetrarchy."
-ANJALI-
These, my companions, have come here on a very important journey.
Dorian Storm, Orym of the Air Ashari.
Fearne, Dariax, and Opal.
There is something greater I have not yet seen, but they are here to ask your help.
-AABRIA-
And Thrascuur's eyes linger on both Dariax and Opal, and then Opal, you catch their eye, and you watch as two dark eyes begin to fill, impossibly, with stars and galaxies, and you feel a faint prickle across your skin, as magic seems to flow over you, as they regard you.
"Interesting."
-AIMEE-
We're not allowed to talk.
-AABRIA-
"What?"
-AIMEE-
That's what she said.
-ANJALI-
Opal.
-AABRIA-
"You're allowed to-- I apologize. I am told that I am severe.
You are allowed to talk."
-AIMEE-
Okay. I was going to ask, how did you get that cool silver stuff? It's really cool.
-AABRIA-
"Thank you.
There is little for us to do here, but to reflect and decorate and create ourselves into that which we would be.
So I just do this." (laughter) A little weirdly proud of their horns, or their tusks.
-AIMEE-
That sounds like a dream.
-MATT-
I'm going to lean over to Dorian while this is happening and be like: See, a lot of us have surnames, too, but only yours got said. That's called branding.
You're doing great.
-AABRIA-
"Would you all come and talk with me upstairs, where there's a little more air?"
-LIAM-
Of course.
-MATT-
Totally.
-AABRIA-
"Is there anything you need? Food?"
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
We're really full.
-MATT-
No, we're good. We're good.
-ANJALI-
We have been well-fed.
I had to stop to see her.
-AABRIA-
"Okay, that's why you know, all right."
-ANJALI-
Oh, uh-- Don't tell her I said something.
-AABRIA-
"I mean, I'm going to."
-ANJALI-
Fine, I deserve it.
-AABRIA-
"You are as severe as I am." And they turn and file out of the hall, and start sweeping up a set of very dark stairs, once again, lit with these pale red flames.
And they lead you up to the roof, which is this massive, flat space covered in, once again blankets and pillows, and this interesting contraption in the center of what is essentially a 40 by 80-foot flat space of mirrors.
what is essentially a 40 by 80-foot flat space of mirrors.
And a single lens pointed up towards the sky, a sky that you look up and see is full of stars, and you haven't seen the stars in so long.
-ANJALI-
It is always easier to breathe easy here.
-AIMEE-
I mean, someone could have told me that my roots were growing in.
I feel like that's something you should have mentioned.
Sorry.
-AABRIA-
"Your hair looks lovely."
-AIMEE-
Thanks. I just-- I haven't seen a mirror in a long time, so it's just like, "Blaugh!" But you know, here we are.
-AABRIA-
"Actually." And they walk over to the contraption, and you see them lift a panel of ornate brass, and they actually slide a mirror free and offer it to you.
-AIMEE-
Thanks. (giggles)
-AABRIA-
You look like shit. (laughs) You've been in the jungle for weeks.
I cannot overstate.
-ANJALI-
Does she still have her sateen head wrap?
-AIMEE-
No, I had to take it off.
-AABRIA-
She had to take it off.
I mean--
-AIMEE-
I don't know what I--
-AABRIA-
Your hair looks great, because it never got wet.
-AIMEE-
I don't know what I was protecting.
-AABRIA-
I'm saying the rest of you is a little ragged.
-AIMEE-
I feel like I've aged.
It's Ted. She's sucking the beauty out of me.
-ANJALI-
She has some things going on with her sister.
But more, for the moment, I believe that your runes are something you want to speak to the tetrarch about.
-AIMEE-
Yes, do you have--
-AABRIA-
Before you put the mirror-- Do you just pocket the mirror?
-AIMEE-
Yep.
(laughter)
-MATT-
But only out of custom.
So sorry. I didn't-- I know this isn't a gift. I don't know.
-AABRIA-
And they reach out to take it back, and in that moment, where both your hands and their hands are touching the mirror, you feel a little shimmer of energy, and you look down at the mirror and you see your face, but different.
Your hair has gone to white, and one of your eyes is blue, and one of your eyes is brown.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
I think this mirror's a bad one, but thanks so much.
-AABRIA-
"Did you touch the--"
-AIMEE-
Sorry.
-AABRIA-
"It's fine."
-AIMEE-
I think you should get it adjusted.
Sometimes mirrors aren't the best--
-ANJALI-
So, the runes?
-AABRIA-
"Sometimes mirrors show you more than you expect to see."
-MATT-
I pull out the scribblings from the large obelisk that we found a short time ago, as well as the original rune that we found at the top of the mountain, and I look over at Fearne.
So, we all traveled.
We were little ways north of here, on Tal-- Gwessar, and this giant mountain sort of appeared out of nowhere, and it was creating ash and fire.
And my friend Fearne here, and her passively functional monkey interacted with the elemental fire there to a strange degree.
But it was specifically a writing that none of us could understand.
And a friend of ours-- I call him a friend, because it's fun.
We just met him.
His name's Shaun Gilmore, a fabulous individual.
If you ever find yourself in Emon, look him up.
He's great.
But he sent us here to see if maybe we could figure out what this symbology means, and if it's dangerous, if it's something we need to figure out what its nature is.
Fearne, if you need to talk on this at all? And I hand the papers over and quickly back up.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that was great.
-AABRIA-
In that moment where you hand off the papers, where both your hand is touching the parchment, as is theirs, you feel a little ripple of energy, and your pendant flashes with that same light that you see now, from the balcony, permeates every other part of this city that is lit up, even at night, except for up here, where a few small flames burn red.
-MATT-
I quickly take my hanging pendant and tuck it into my little chain shirt. (clears throat)
-AABRIA-
"Do you have anything to add?"
-ASHLEY-
He did a very good job.
But yeah, essentially this mountain just shot up out of the ground, and in the middle was this rune.
And we're just trying to figure out what it all means.
-AABRIA-
"What does that have to do with all of this?"
-ASHLEY-
Well, I pulled him out of the ground.
-AABRIA-
"With your own hands?"
-ASHLEY-
Well, yes.
-AABRIA-
"Incredible."
-ANJALI-
Tetrarch Thrascuur.
The only other time I have heard of anything like this happening, even remotely close, was when my parents fought, long ago.
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-ANJALI-
It worries me now.
-AABRIA-
"This symbol, the one you said is on the mountain that rose up, it is a marker of a place too full of energy, ripe for creation, for potential.
What do you think magic is? What do you think magic is? How do you understand it?"
-LIAM-
Well, I've heard it discussed as being the raw potential of the world around us.
-AABRIA-
"Yes. Yes, exactly.
It is-- It is undifferentiated.
It is not divine.
It is not something wrought by man.
It is not nature.
It is whatever it needs to be.
It is simply power.
The decision, the deciding makes it a thing." And they reach down and pick up one of the little oil lamps.
"The power of this candle is nothing against the thought that I have to put it out.
So what is a thought against something that turns and burns in the world? All of this place, all of Exandria, holds potential, holds energy, grabs it, takes it, makes it and gives it.
But it is the decision of you reaching into a place, full and ripe, of you reaching into a place, full and ripe, and deciding to bring something into being.
That is the power that some call of the gods, that some called the arcane.
It is power and it is beautiful, and for you to know that, to have seen it up close.
I understand now why you are here.
You are incredible.
All of you.
What would you have me do with this symbol?"
-LIAM-
Well, the place in the world where we come from, which has been more or less at peace for a little while, anyway.
-AABRIA-
"What is a little while?"
-LIAM-
A few decades.
-AABRIA-
"Go on."
-LIAM-
Very little while.
But the city that we all joined together in has been having trouble with that kind of raw potential.
And this symbol that we've come to ask you about is another instance of it not too far from the city.
I don't know if it's a pattern.
I don't know if they're connected, but it has folks up there worried.
And so, we've been sent down to see if we could come back with any kind of solution or aid.
-AABRIA-
"The simple, shortest answer is the rune is proof that something is deciding what it will be.
That doesn't mean that it is too late to change its course.
I will provide you with whatever information you need for those up there to react to it, however you may."
-ROBBIE-
What sort of thing could will a mountain into being?
-MATT-
Is it going to get worse?
-AABRIA-
"What is worse? More? Yes.
But what is worse?"
-MATT-
More dangerous, and probably burn a lot of people to death.
-AABRIA-
"That may yet be."
-MATT-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
We cannot allow that to happen again.
-AABRIA-
"Will you bend the focus of your life to stop it?"
-ANJALI-
I go where The Gift tells me.
-AABRIA-
"The Gift is nothing without your intuition and decision behind it, Fy'ra Rai.
"The Gift is nothing without your intuition and decision behind it, Fy'ra Rai.
You focus so much on what that source of power would tell you or have of you, but you, you are the conduit for it.
It is simply energy.
<i>You</i> focus it with <i>your</i> intention.
So what is it that you want? That is what you have always been led to, whether or not you knew it."
-ANJALI-
I want to stop this from ever happening again.
And if this is where my friends are going, I want to go with them.
I want to go with them.
-AABRIA-
"Who am I to stop you from any choice you would make? The course that you're on, it will end, one way or another, with glory or tears, death or fire.
It's the deciding, from moment to moment, that will determine how things really end."
-AIMEE-
I call bullshit.
-ANJALI-
Opal!
-AABRIA-
"No.
Go on."
-AIMEE-
You say that we can control magic, that power is just energy, and do whatever you want with it.
Well, some of us just don't have magic that's our own.
So I call bullshit.
I think we're just at the whim of whoever controls the power.
-AABRIA-
"So who do you think controls you, then?"
-AIMEE-
Not me.
-AABRIA-
"How old are you?"
-AIMEE-
19.
-AABRIA-
"And you have everything figured out?"
-AIMEE-
I mean, I have that figured out.
-AABRIA-
"What did you see in the mirror?"
-AIMEE-
Someone that needs some sleep, and also one of my eyes have changed color, which, not thrilled about.
It's probably the stress.
-ASHLEY-
Do we notice that?
-AABRIA-
No.
-ASHLEY-
That wasn't--
-AABRIA-
She looks completely the same.
-MATT-
She needs some sleep.
She's not wrong.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I need sleep.
And (sighs) I just, I don't know.
I just think you're coming from a place of privilege, as someone who has power coming out of your titty racks.
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
"Titty racks."
-AIMEE-
Sorry. I know that's rude.
Sometimes I can get rude.
-AABRIA-
"I am the leader of a city--"
-AIMEE-
I know. Sorry.
-AABRIA-
"-- that was lost."
-AIMEE-
Look, I'm sorry, I--
-AABRIA-
"Thousands of years."
-AIMEE-
You're right. I'm being so disrespectful.
I just--
-AABRIA-
"I don't care about your disrespect.
I want you to learn the lesson without me spelling it out for you."
-AIMEE-
Spell it out.
Spell it out.
-AABRIA-
"The person you saw in the mirror.
Your mother.
Yes?"
-AIMEE-
I mean, I don't know.
I think that's what she looks like, but I don't know.
-AABRIA-
"You remember.
It's hard to remember, but you remember."
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
"And you are conflicted.
Speak it.
What are you afraid of?"
-AIMEE-
I never had my own life.
-AABRIA-
"Every choice you make, I keep going back to it.
I apologize.
Your life is your own, because you have chosen.
Every step that you've taken that has led you from wherever you began to these people, to here.
Sweet child," and the tetrarch comes over to you, and hesitates just before embracing you, just trying to consent check.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
And wraps you up and holds you.
Now that you're in physical proximity, they are seven feet tall, and completely wrap you up, and just hold you in this moment.
"You feel divided, between you and the one that resides within, but you are special, because you are part.
Half, whole in yourself, but you are more, just as your mother was.
A rarity in this world.
Georgina, you and your sister will always walk this world together, but where you go is your choice, your choosing, and she follows you, becomes a part of you because she loves you.
And that is <i>her</i> choice, and her choosing.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
"I'm sorry.
Your road isn't easy."
-AIMEE-
Thanks for the hug.
-AABRIA-
And they slowly release you, and set you back on your feet and wipe your eye.
"You are, all of you, even you, at the precipice of becoming-- becoming great or terrible things.
The world constantly changes, and that's not the gods.
That's the men that walk upon the earth, and you are those people that will change the fate of the world.
I see omens and portents in the stars, in the moon.
And in all of your eyes.
I will give you all the information you need to take back to Shaun Gilmore, to do whatever you will do with the runes and the mesa, this place of burning and potential.
But you have to decide what you will do.
What you will become.
And the last I will say is this: power is neither good, nor evil.
It simply is." And they regard you, and look towards your pack.
-MATT-
Can I hide it?
-AABRIA-
"My eyes see much, but like the Observer that came before us, that blessed us with this Gift, this wild, chaotic intuition; magic, it's not for me to tell you what to do, simply to encourage you to do whatever it is in your nature to do.
You have not spoken."
-ROBBIE-
So wise.
Why did your friend, Umejii, leave?
-AABRIA-
"She headed south.
We were told, intuited that something terrible was coming." "intuited that something terrible was coming."
-ROBBIE-
Something terrible.
-AABRIA-
"Yes.
She went to see if those that reside to the south had plans."
-ROBBIE-
And she went alone?
-AABRIA-
"She works well alone."
-ROBBIE-
Hmm.
-AABRIA-
"But are you concerned for?"
-ROBBIE-
I can't help but wonder.
We were sent to this path, and we encountered you, and we were meant for such great things.
Why you would like to send us back to where we came? Perhaps we were sent here to help your friend.
-AABRIA-
"Something I had not considered.
Do you want to help her?"
-ROBBIE-
I don't know her, but we are good at helping people.
But I'm afraid, perhaps I've made too many decisions for this group as it is, but just couldn't shake the thought.
-MATT-
No, no, that's why you're our leader.
-AIMEE-
What doesn't make sense is, Elam said that that symbol meant a place of burning, which is kind of like a duh.
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-AIMEE-
So-- And then we encountered this big rune or thing and there was all this writing and it sounded like a grocery list.
So it feels like there's just-- There's nothing meaningful about the writing.
It's like a label, like this is what this is.
Yeah, no shit, it's on fire. It's a burning place.
So what does Shaun Gilmore need the translator for? I mean, it sounds like it's just kind of redundant.
I could be wrong.
That's my two cents.
-AABRIA-
And you see that the tetrarch is looking at you not unkindly as you voice your truth and they reach into their robes and pull out a small bit of charcoal to write.
And they lean down and onto just the blank concrete surface of this roof, begin to draw a symbol.
Now, Orym and Dariax both touched that massive sheet of runic writing and were able to intuit it, yes?
-LIAM-
I never got--
-AABRIA-
Oh, no, it was Dorian. That's right. Perfect.
And as the tetrarch finishes, you see a symbol that especially from this vantage point at this high place in the city, you can glance off to the side and see it looks a little bit like the shape of the city and both of you can read it and you know that this is the name, Niirdal-Poc.
It is also the shape of the thing.
It is a picture of the place and the word itself.
And you see the tetrarch lean down and put their hand over the symbol and it flares with light and every lamp across the city goes out.
"The shape of the thing holds power, too, and your friend likely did not understand that.
To touch a place of burning is to interact with the potential of it, and to learn what it is and what it could be and decide what it will be next."
-AIMEE-
That makes sense.
-AABRIA-
"If you expected instructions on how to fix it, then you, young one, are very quickly learning the truth of the world.
There are no easy answers.
There are no simple solves.
And you probably, somewhere within you, know what is best.
The right path to take."
-ANJALI-
Tetrarch, if this place of burning is of the fire, and I am of the fire.
-AABRIA-
"Yes."
-ANJALI-
Is why I have been led to them? To shield them, to take the fire away, to do something.
And you can just see, she's starting to turn into, like, a teenager and lose all the normal sense of Fy'ra Rai's composure.
She just doesn't know what to do again for the-- And she's reverting back to ages ago when everything went down.
-AABRIA-
And the tetrarch very quickly removes their hands from the symbol and the lights come back up and they rush over to you and grab you by the hands.
-ANJALI-
And my tattoo starts to flare.
-AABRIA-
"An important gift, all of them, important.
But what is it that you want? You seek to protect, but what is it that you <i>want</i>?" And their pressure on your hands begins to hurt.
Take one point of bludgeoning damage as they are squeezing a little harder than intended.
-ANJALI-
Whoops, I forgot to do this last time, but that's okay.
I never healed from the last episode.
-AABRIA-
Oh god, it's been like four days.
Everyone, please take a long rest.
-ANJALI-
There we go.
My shoulder, it still hurts.
Now my hand does.
-AABRIA-
Please roll a wisdom saving throw.
-ANJALI-
15.
-AABRIA-
In this moment, I want to ask you, the player.
What do you care about most? What does Fy'ra Rai want most?
-ANJALI-
To see her family again.
-AABRIA-
And as your eyes shut, wincing a little bit from the pain, you are pushed bodily back into that space where you interact between your instincts, your instincts that have led you and kept you safe this entire time.
And that little bit of nudge from The Gift.
And you see points of light, the five people surrounding you that you have chosen to protect, but there is that well, that gravitational pull up north, west, far away where your family lies, where your sister stands, alive, waiting for you, looking for you, calling out for you.
-ANJALI-
No.
She-- She-- She lives!
-AABRIA-
"You would not have kept looking, kept wandering if you truly believed she was gone."
-ANJALI-
How? When I saw the spot flare, do I have a sense of how near it is to where they are going?
-AABRIA-
Opposite direction.
-ANJALI-
Fuck me.
-AABRIA-
Well, you see that their attention is split going off of what, Jesus Christ, off of what Dorian said, that's farther to the south at the very edge of the continent, but going back north towards the Scar of the Cinder King and everything you need to deal with.
You are even more north of that and west of that.
-ANJALI-
She is even more north of that and west of that.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
I am transported, gotcha.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
So it's like--
-AABRIA-
Yes, it's a magical--
-ANJALI-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's definitely not in the direction that Umejii has gone in, it's north.
-AABRIA-
No, opposite direction.
-ANJALI-
I think she's-- I'm just-- She's paralyzed with indecision suddenly and says nothing and just looks.
Okay.
Who do I--? I have sworn to protect them.
-AABRIA-
"And you have, you led them here to the answers that they sought, to the next choice that they will make.
You have not failed them.
You will not fail them."
-ANJALI-
Someone is watching Opal.
We encountered them in the forest.
I have kept a watch over her until now.
But someone else has been following her with their eyes and nothing else.
One of the elves of Syngorn, I believe.
-AABRIA-
"I understand."
-AIMEE-
I don't--
-AABRIA-
"The thing that you are, you and your sister together."
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
"Power, potential that you haven't realized because you have a lot of, like, rejection energy, I don't know.
Yeah, see, he knows.
If someone else saw it, if someone else seeks it."
-AIMEE-
Why would they want that?
-AABRIA-
"Why don't you?"
-AIMEE-
I just want to be my own person.
-AABRIA-
"What makes you think that you're not? Everyone carries so with them all of the time.
Their past, the things that they ran from."
-AIMEE-
It's not the same, but okay.
Who's watching me and why?
-AABRIA-
"I told you before, I don't have all of the answers but I can help," and they reach their hand out and you feel an energy, like a very cold egg, the albumen running over you.
And then you feel a sense, a breath, a gasp, a moment of peace from deep within you as Ted finally relaxes.
"That will prevent any scrying for now.
Protect each other."
-ANJALI-
Thank you, wise one.
-AABRIA-
"Not so wise, just in charge."
-ANJALI-
(chuckles) My sister lives.
My sister lives.
-AABRIA-
"What is your name?"
-LIAM-
Orym of the Air Ashari.
-AABRIA-
"Yes, that's it." And you see them look over their shoulder and a young acolyte, another one of these clerics clearly covered in regalia of the two moons, Catha and Ruidus, I'll say it right eventually.
-LIAM-
I've been meaning to ask, too.
What is the composition of the two moons? Are they next to each other? Do they look anything like his tattoo, by coincidence?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you look up and you see that it is a massive upturned crescent and then just above it, a little off from the orientation of your tattoo, which is a little bit more stylized.
But that bloody, ruddy, tiny moon, full above it.
And do you want to do anything?
-LIAM-
Say again.
-AABRIA-
Nothing.
The acolyte comes over and hands a small package to the tetrarch and hands a small package to the tetrarch who then turns and opens it and unfolds it and offers it to you.
A seed.
"The world is wild and many things, coincidences that cannot be explained, but I knew when this came on the breeze, that this was for you.
So accept it."
-LIAM-
If they are offering it, then yes, I'll accept it.
-AABRIA-
And it's just this massive, dark green peach pit of a seed.
-LIAM-
Thank you. Thank you.
-AABRIA-
"You're welcome."
-LIAM-
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be disrespectful, what am I meant to do with this?
-AABRIA-
"You are an Ashari, are you not?"
-LIAM-
I am.
-AABRIA-
"Then make it grow."
-LIAM-
All right.
-AABRIA-
What do you do?
-LIAM-
I'll tuck it away.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
And they turn and look at you all.
Are you okay?
-ROBBIE-
That was Robbie Daymond sighing.
-AABRIA-
Oh shi-- (laughter) Sorry, it was so dramatic.
-ROBBIE-
I was waiting with bated breath, watching the scene.
It was the audience, sorry, sorry.
Above table, I guess.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good, you're good, my bad.
I was in the moment. I got lost in the sauce, I apologize.
"Is there anything else you would ask of me? Is there anything else I can do for you?"
-LIAM-
Is there anything we can do for you in exchange for your help? You mentioned...
one of the tetrarchs, your f--
-ANJALI-
Umejii.
Is there anything we can do to assist her?
-AABRIA-
"She is headed south across the Beynsfal Plateau.
You can go help her, if you want.
I am not here to tell you what to do and nothing is required.
I told you what I feel you already knew."
-LIAM-
I believe in returning one good turn with another.
-AABRIA-
"Then I do have a request.
If something is coming, if this place is meant for change, growth, destruction, discovery, whatever it is, please remember it, carry it with you.
I don't want, after all this time, for this to end here and now, forgotten.
You, so long-lived, please carry us with you."
-ASHLEY-
Always.
-AABRIA-
"That's all I would ask.
I'm going to look at the stars for myself for the future and the past, I observe and I remember.
You may stay with me.
You may move on, out, up, away.
It is you who must decide what happens next but I will treasure the time I have spent with you for as long as I have." And they move towards that device, reseat the mirror back into place and begin gazing down into it and quickly lose themselves to gazing upward at the stars.
and quickly lose themselves to gazing upward at the stars.
-ANJALI-
We shall go.
-MATT-
Which way?
-ANJALI-
Follow me.
And I lead them back down the stairs.
Actually, I get about halfway down the stairs and I say: It is down that way, I do have one more question.
And I run back up and I quietly speak behind the tetrarch.
Tetrarch, my apologies.
-AABRIA-
"None required."
-ANJALI-
There is one of our party.
I fear they may be drawn south for the wrong reasons.
I cannot let them go, but I can not hold them back.
What do I do?
-AABRIA-
"You are wise to fear for them.
They are losing themselves to the thrall of something great and terrible.
But you cannot choose for them."
-ANJALI-
I know, I tried that once.
-AABRIA-
"And where does it land you?"
-ANJALI-
Back in the same place again.
-AABRIA-
"So what have you learned?"
-ANJALI-
It is a fool's-- It is a fool's errand, but I cannot help but try.
Thank you.
And I bow and leave.
-AABRIA-
"Be safe." And they go back to gazing at the stars.
-ANJALI-
I meet up with you guys and-- Shall we head back to Elam?
-MATT-
Yeah, no, that was...
that was intense.
-LIAM-
It was a lot.
-MATT-
Yeah, very intense person.
-ASHLEY-
Do you know what that seed is?
-LIAM-
I've never seen one quite like that, I've seen quite a few, I reckon you have as well.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
That's cool, it just came here and then they gave it to you.
-LIAM-
Have to find a good place for it.
-ASHLEY-
Those are special.
-LIAM-
Maybe back north.
GM, they said their name was-- Sorry, just so I have it for the future-- what their name was.
-AABRIA-
Their title is Tetrarch.
-LIAM-
Tetrarch, right.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, and their name is Thrascuur.
-LIAM-
Thrascuur, thank you.
-AABRIA-
Now I need everyone to make a perception check with disadvantage.
-MATT-
Disadvantage?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it's dark and it's foggy.
-MATT-
Shit.
-AIMEE-
Aw, fuck.
-ANJALI-
(singing) Brutal.
-MATT-
(singing) Seven.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ANJALI-
Eight.
-LIAM-
11.
-ASHLEY-
Five.
-ROBBIE-
14.
-AIMEE-
Two.
-LIAM-
Peace.
-AIMEE-
She's thinking about other things.
-ANJALI-
We both are.
-MATT-
TPK.
-ANJALI-
Yeah! (laughter)
-AIMEE-
Wait, what's that?
-AIMEE-
Oh, yeah! Reliable party killer, right here.
-AABRIA-
Dorian, you believe you see a swirl of fog and some movement in it around you and that's confirmed when you see Opal's hand suddenly moves to her neck as a tiny little dart fletched in purple sticking out.
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
-LIAM-
We're in the city, damn!
-MATT-
So we're going north, we going south, we're going back to the fiery mountain?
-AIMEE-
14.
-AABRIA-
You have one round, but you feel yourself suddenly swooning and everything gets really slow and blurred and stretched out as you reach for and grab the little dart.
What do you do?
-AIMEE-
I have-- I have a poison thing that I bought.
-AABRIA-
What's a poison thing that you bought?
-AIMEE-
Wait, remember?
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
Hold on.
-AABRIA-
We're going to use our full vocabulary.
-AIMEE-
I got a potion of healing, but first I would like to know, is it poison? Or I guess it doesn't matter, does it?
-AABRIA-
I mean, make a-- Let's do a self-diagnosis, medicine check.
-AIMEE-
Why not? Oh shit, six.
-AABRIA-
It certainly feels like something poisonous is happening, but you don't feel sick, you just feel-- I mean, yeah, there's something.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I'm going to hold onto my potion and I guess I will just look around to see if I could see where it came from or if there's any kind of clue as to who just threw that dart at me.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so you're going to spend your turn this round looking around?
-AIMEE-
Well...
yeah, otherwise I'm just going to fucking do an Eldritch Blast on an unseen--
-AABRIA-
I need you to tell me exactly what you do.
I need you to make that decision.
-AIMEE-
(squeaky yell)
-ROBBIE-
Did I clock this, did you say I clocked this?
-AABRIA-
You saw a motion, like the fog moved a little bit.
-ROBBIE-
But I didn't necessarily see her get poked or did I?
-AABRIA-
If she's not going to alert the group to it--
-AIMEE-
Oh no, I want to alert the group.
Okay, so I'm going to say--
-ANJALI-
We were all waiting for it, we're like, "What is it?!"
-AABRIA-
I was so convinced she's not going to say anything.
-LIAM-
We're all like, "Put me in coach, put me in!"
-MATT-
We're over here having a conversation like: So, we're going up north, south?
-AIMEE-
I could have sworn that you said that something happened with Dorian while the thing poked me.
-AABRIA-
Dorian saw motion.
-AIMEE-
Oh, Dorian saw motion, okay.
So I'll look at this thing and I'll be like: Guys, I think something just hit me.
So I'll say that and then do I have to spend my whole action looking around? Or can I look around as a thing that I do without an action?
-AABRIA-
I mean, be specific on what you're trying--
-AIMEE-
Do I know who did it? Can I see the creature or a person that hit me?
-AABRIA-
So if you're looking for the thing, the looking is the action.
-AIMEE-
Well, fuck me.
-AABRIA-
I'm just trying to figure out what you're doing because I'm about to do something fun and I'm trying to make sure you have your-- You feel self-actualized before I knock you the fuck out.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
I don't even know what that means.
-MATT-
That's my opening to any confrontation going forward.
I'm just giving you a moment to self-actualize before I knock you the fuck out.
-AABRIA-
You told me as the Tetrarch to be blunt.
-AIMEE-
Okay, all right, all right.
-LIAM-
Are we talking about the game? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Let's go!
-AIMEE-
I'm sorry I'm taking so much time.
-AABRIA-
No, you're golden.
-AIMEE-
I've now alerted the group and I am going to use my action to hide behind something, I don't know what's around, but--
-MATT-
How do you alert us?
-AIMEE-
I fucking tell you!
-ANJALI-
What she just said.
She said: Guys, I think--
-AIMEE-
Guys, I think I-- what am I missing here?!
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
-ANJALI-
That was good, that was good.
-AABRIA-
You're good.
-LIAM-
Caleb-- Caleb, shit! Wrong campaign! (laughter and cheering)
-MATT-
The [inaudible] is strong.
-ROBBIE-
Three years.
-LIAM-
I miss him already.
Orym whips around and is looking eye-line trying to see anybody in their periphery.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
Likewise.
-ROBBIE-
I'm--
-LIAM-
(as Caleb) <i>Ja</i>, okay.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
Okay, what's happening?
-AABRIA-
You got them.
-ASHLEY-
I am going to just go up to Opal
I am going to just go up to Opal and just try to just look around and try to--
-AABRIA-
She's actively running away from you to go try to hide behind something.
Are you willing to be wrapped up?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I think that she's, like you said, pretty foggy and disorientated.
So I think her natural reaction is to say something and then find a place where she can no longer be hit by the dart and if Fearne is offering protection.
-AABRIA-
Fearne, you wrap her up.
What do you do in this heartbeat?
-ANJALI-
Staff out, staff expanded and looking around and also using the staff to explore including my eyes.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
In the movement, I noticed which direction it was coming from?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it was right over your shoulder and probably 20 feet behind you.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah and between me and that is Orym.
-AABRIA-
So you're interposed between-- You are between Opal and whatever motion, so, the fog.
-ROBBIE-
I was picturing the closest person is Orym to me.
-AABRIA-
Works for me, love that.
-ROBBIE-
So I'm going to run over to him and I'm going to grab him on the shoulder and I'm going to say: Find them.
and cast Invisibility on Orym.
-LIAM-
Whoa.
-AIMEE-
Whoa, dope.
-AABRIA-
Dope.
-ROBBIE-
Cool.
-AABRIA-
All right.
Dariax, what do you do?
-MATT-
I'm going to go ahead and be like: Shit! I'm going to go ahead and cast Bless, I'm going to go ahead and bless Dorian, I'm going to bless Fearne and I'm about to go ahead and bless Orym, but you vanish.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
I am so bad at Invisibility.
-MATT-
No, it's good! So I'll cast it on you.
-ANJALI-
Word.
-MATT-
So--
-ANJALI-
Bless is?
-MATT-
Plus a d4 to attack rolls and saving throws.
-AIMEE-
Nice.
-AABRIA-
And in the moment where you run over to Orym--
-LIAM-
What I really need it for is stealth.
-AABRIA-
You feel a gust of wind behind you as something makes a beeline in Opal's direction.
And I-- What's your armor class?
-ASHLEY-
17.
-AABRIA-
You get hit very, very hard in the ribs, and you're going to take four points of bludgeoning damage as something absolutely drills into your ribcage, trying to get to Opal around you.
So I need you to make a strength saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
Those are not good for me.
Okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
12.
-AABRIA-
You take the hit and wince.
And in that heartbeat of you tensing up, you feel yourself pushed bodily away from Opal.
Opal, you're grabbed, and in this groggy moment, you look around and you don't see anyone, but you feel arms and a shoulder and yourself going up and over someone's shoulder, as you lose consciousness.
-AIMEE-
Fuck. Okay.
So I can't do anything.
-AABRIA-
Not yet.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
Do we see this? Can we see what is happening?
-AABRIA-
You don't see any person.
You saw Fearne get hit and pushed away, and then Opal gets picked up, and is flopped over this invisible point in space five feet in the air.
-ANJALI-
But we can make out--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
Yes, okay.
-AABRIA-
So I'm going to say you have an opportunity attack as it moves through the center of the group.
-ANJALI-
Yes, please.
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
So please make an attack roll with disadvantage because you don't see anyone.
I'm going to give Orym one, too.
-ANJALI-
Oh man. Why, why disadvantage? Oh, still 19.
I keep forgetting I'm strong.
-AABRIA-
Oh, no, you're away, never mind.
Okay, 19 with disadvantage?
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
You're able to swing out and you connect with someone.
-ANJALI-
Mm-hmm.
Can I?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, roll damage.
-ANJALI-
That's not my damage. Where's my damage? What's your fucking damage? 12 plus three, nine.
-AABRIA-
How'd that number go backwards?
-ANJALI-
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry, wait, no, that is not right. It is nine.
-AABRIA-
Nine points of damage?
-ANJALI-
Nine points of damage.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
Sweet.
All right.
You connect with something as it scoops up Opal and continues through the darkness, and keeps going out and away.
You're invisible, and I need everyone to roll initiative.
This is a chase sequence, so it's going to go a little different.
-AIMEE-
That's fun.
Including me?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Oh no.
-AABRIA-
Okay, anyone, 25 to 20?
-ROBBIE-
22.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, okay, okay, okay.
19 to 15?
-ANJALI-
16.
-LIAM-
Rolled low, real low.
Real low, with advantage, rolled low.
-AABRIA-
Oh no.
-AIMEE-
Can I use my inspiration from last game?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, that chapter's over.
-ASHLEY-
I forgot my inspiration.
-AIMEE-
Ugh, didn't help that much, but I'll take it.
-AABRIA-
14 to 10.
-ASHLEY-
14.
-AABRIA-
Nice.
-ROBBIE-
We're counting on you, buddy.
-AABRIA-
Okay, somebody's nine to five?
-AIMEE-
Wait.
-LIAM-
Eight.
-AABRIA-
Wait, you both got eight?
-AIMEE-
No, no, no, no, I want to take that back and use my original number.
Because I don't want to use my inspiration on this shit.
-AABRIA-
Okay, what was your original number?
-AIMEE-
One. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
You know what? That's--
-AIMEE-
Perfect.
-AABRIA-
That's thematically perfect.
-AIMEE-
Perfect.
Yeah, I love that.
-MATT-
Any bonus to your initiative?
-AIMEE-
What's that?
-MATT-
Do you have a bonus to your initiative?
-AIMEE-
I don't think so.
-AABRIA-
What's the little box say for initiative?
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah, plus two!
-ASHLEY-
Hey!
-AABRIA-
Have you been doing that wrong the whole time?
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Vibes.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
You learn something new every day.
-AABRIA-
Okay, Orym got an eight?
-AIMEE-
That's a three, baby.
-MATT-
The good news is you're not alone.
-AABRIA-
Amazing, all right.
Womp-womp squad, who got a one to a four? Three?
-MATT-
Three.
I rolled a one, too.
-AABRIA-
Yikes.
Who has the higher dex between the two of you?
-MATT-
Mine's a plus two.
-AIMEE-
Mine's a plus two.
-MATT-
My dex total is 14.
-AIMEE-
So total with the plus two?
-MATT-
Just my total dex.
-AABRIA-
The number.
-AIMEE-
15.
-MATT-
So you're before me.
I'm picking my nose over there, like: Wait, what's going on? Where'd Opal go?
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-MATT-
Why are you punching? What's going on?
-AIMEE-
Ooh, I love a chase.
-ROBBIE-
You got six darts sticking out of your neck.
(slurring) "Where's Opal?"
-AIMEE-
(mumbling) "Why am I--"
-ASHLEY-
"I'm very tired."
-MATT-
It's like Will Ferrell in that--
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy, this isn't good.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so.
-MATT-
It's fine.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
All right, rules for a chase.
Things are going to go a little bit differently.
So on your turn, you have your move and you have one action.
There's no bonus actions here.
There's no reactions.
And at the end of your turn, you're going to roll a d20 for a complication for the next person in initiative.
-AIMEE-
Oh fuck!
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
All right, so first up is Dorian.
Dorian, you see a slumped over Opal limply moving into the night.
What do you want to do about it?
-ROBBIE-
I take off after her at full speed.
And I don't have-- Okay, how far away am I from floating Opal? Once I go the full 30 feet, is she far away?
-AABRIA-
I mean, this person was moving their full speed, too, so right now you've maintained the 20 feet apart.
-ROBBIE-
We maintain that 20 feet apart.
Okay, I am going to use my handaxe, throwable, that has a 20-foot range.
And I'm going to wing that thing at the center mass of whatever I think has got Opal.
-AABRIA-
Okay, make an attack roll with disadvantage.
-MATT-
Add a d4.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're blessed!
-ANJALI-
Bless!
-ROBBIE-
Okay, with disadvantage.
Hey! And then a d4, one, two, three, four.
17 plus four, and four is 21.
-AABRIA-
21 absolutely hits.
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-ROBBIE-
Cool.
And that is 1d6 plus two.
Five, seven.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-MATT-
Nice.
-AIMEE-
Way to go, baby.
-ROBBIE-
I whip that thing out, it's my flute axe.
I've never thrown it before.
But I imagine that when I wing it, it makes a beautiful-- It almost plays a melody as it soars through the air.
-MATT-
That's cool.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ROBBIE-
Smacks into whatever's got her.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
So you hit into its-- You don't know what part of this thing's body, but it's stuck there, floating in the air--
-AIMEE-
Oh shit.
-AABRIA-
-- as it keeps going, as it takes the damage and keeps moving.
-ROBBIE-
Opal, my flute!
-AIMEE-
Don't forget the flute!
-MATT-
Do you have a name for your axe?
-ROBBIE-
How dare you ask me something like that. I do not.
-MATT-
Dariax has a name for your axe when this is done.
-AABRIA-
I'm sure it's just Dari.
-ROBBIE-
Nice. No name, I'm excited.
-AABRIA-
Okay, I need you to roll a d20 for me.
-ROBBIE-
Oh yes.
You said this complicates things for the person behind me?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ROBBIE-
So is a lower d20 or higher better?
-AABRIA-
Guess we'll find out.
-ROBBIE-
Fuck! No, we won't, 10.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
We've learned nothing!
-AIMEE-
All right! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
So you take off behind the person.
The next one up is actually our mysterious figure, so you've complicated it for bad guy.
-AIMEE-
Nice.
-ANJALI-
Yay!
-AABRIA-
Who you actually see, because you're tracking both Opal's body and your axe floating in the air, as you see it try to suddenly turn and head down an alley.
And it's going to skid out and slam against the wall.
I need you-- no, you're--
-AIMEE-
She's passed out.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're going to take two points of bludgeoning damage as your body rocks into a building as they turn a corner and continue to run.
So this person has now wrapped around a corner, and they're moving their full speed.
And what you see them do, because you are the closest in this line, you actually see them flash into being, a flurry of purple robes as they pull off a ring and slide it back on again to recast Invisibility, Greater Invisibility, as your axe and Opal disappear from sight.
-AIMEE-
Oh, goddamn it.
-ANJALI-
So they're around the corner?
-AABRIA-
Yep. But you can hear footsteps, by the way.
This is not a silent chase.
Okay, next up is Fy'ra.
And Fearne, you're on deck.
-ANJALI-
I am hauling ass because I can't-- They are not within my line of sight.
I need to get them in my line of sight.
So I have 40 movement.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ANJALI-
So I am hauling ass.
How far around the corner do I get and what do I see?
-AABRIA-
You get around the corner, and you turn and you can hear footsteps splashing through what you imagine is this fog that's congealing into puddles.
-ANJALI-
But I can't see the axe, I can't see Opal?
-AABRIA-
You don't see the axe or Opal.
-ANJALI-
Right, I...
blast my hands together, I slam them on the floor, and I cast Thundewave and see if that does a damn thing.
-AABRIA-
I want to add one bit of information that I did unfortunately forget to mention.
So you also have the option as an action to take a dash action, which is your speed again.
-ANJALI-
Without using my--
-AABRIA-
But that counts as your action.
-ANJALI-
So Step of the Wind would count as my action? That's normally a bonus action.
That's why I was like--
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you get one thing to do.
You can take the dash action up to three times plus your constitution modifier.
After that, I'm going to have you start rolling for exhaustion.
After a certain level of exhaustion, you drop out.
-ANJALI-
But I don't really have a sense of how far ahead of me they are.
-AABRIA-
Correct.
-ANJALI-
Fuck, all right.
In that case, screw Thunderwave.
-AABRIA-
So do you double your move?
-ANJALI-
I'm going to double my movement and I'm just going to catch up and keep up.
-AABRIA-
Catch up with what?
-ANJALI-
I'm going in the direction that I'm hearing.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so you're able to close the distance and you hear footsteps, but you can't quite see what's around you to locate it.
But you hear footsteps right in front of you.
-ANJALI-
This way, everyone, this way! I just start calling back to everyone, so they have a sense of where we are in the fog.
-AABRIA-
Perfect, roll a d20.
-ANJALI-
11. This one goes to 11.
-AABRIA-
Yep, you're good.
Nothing happens. Fearne, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so--
-AABRIA-
High is good.
-ASHLEY-
We can't see them.
We can't see her at all.
Okay, so what I'm going--
-ANJALI-
But I'm calling. Run towards me because I'm closer to them.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I am going to start running and--
-AABRIA-
What's your movement speed?
-ASHLEY-
35 feet.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-ASHLEY-
Obviously.
I'm just very stressed right now.
-AABRIA-
You're good, you're good.
-ASHLEY-
I am going to jump into Wild Shape and into a dire wolf, which gives me a little bit more speed.
-AABRIA-
Amazing. Love it.
-ROBBIE-
Thought you'd choose a hippopotamus for sure.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Maybe one day.
So then if that's my action, then I just--
-AABRIA-
So you move and your action was to transform.
-ASHLEY-
Got it, okay.
And then I'm just booking it.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-ASHLEY-
And because of hopping into a dire wolf, I have keen hearing and smell, so I'm hoping that I can--
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
Oh yeah, the moment you transform-- What does your dire wolf look like? Paint me a word picture.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so the dire wolf is sort of silvery and the face is just this beautiful just black fur and with a silver stripe on their back, my back, I guess.
And the eyes are greenish and little mossy bits on the end of the tail.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ANJALI-
Those mossy bits.
-ASHLEY-
So I'm just nose ready and eyes ready and just trying to smell for Opal and trying to--
-AABRIA-
I'll have you roll it now.
Go ahead and make a perception check with your keen senses.
You tell me, is this primarily hearing or smell? There's no real difference between it. That's for flavor.
-ASHLEY-
Smell.
-AABRIA-
Cool.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
17.
-AABRIA-
Nice.
Hey, Opal, what perfume are you wearing today?
-AIMEE-
Oh, she's wearing I would imagine like a cedar, no, a sandalwood something, yeah.
-AABRIA-
This smell of really fake, terrible cedarwood just hits you right in the nose and you snap your head, probably just a little bit to the right and a little bit past where you see Fy'ra standing.
-ASHLEY-
Just keep on booking it.
-AABRIA-
Yep, perfect. All right.
-ANJALI-
So does she get past me?
-AABRIA-
No, 35 feet of movement does not beat 40 feet of movement.
-ANJALI-
Oh, I thought she changed into the dire wolf and ran.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, but the dire wolf doesn't also then move.
The transformation was the action.
-ASHLEY-
I think probably next turn, their-- their-- my speed.
-AABRIA-
Yo, here's the thing.
Sexual dimorphism in animals is such an important thing that you can turn into a male animal if it's cooler.
If you want to turn into a peacock, you don't have to turn into a peahen because you're feminine.
Those birds suck.
Be the cool one that's pretty.
-ASHLEY-
Every animal is a sweet boy.
-AABRIA-
(laughing) Exactly, sweet boy.
-MATT-
There are a lot of dude animals that suck in the animal kingdom.
-AABRIA-
True. I would rather be a lioness than a lion.
-ANJALI-
I would choose a female praying mantis.
-MATT-
Not even in the animal kingdoms.
-AIMEE-
You eat the head. (biting noise)
-AABRIA-
So anyway, we can talk about gender and what Wild Shape is at literally any other time.
But the rest of you that are just beginning to take off, you're still in this central plaza.
And then all of a sudden, you hear a low rumble and a creak.
And you look over, and the remnants of a magical spell being cast glimmer purple as they wash over those two massive porphyry statues of the three headed meat beast, call it a Bandersnatch, as they slowly begin to come to life under an Animate Object spell, as someone else in this fight who defies being seen right now has taken their action.
And there are now two more combatants in the fray.
But that was their turn.
Next up is Orym. Opal, you're after, and then Dariax at the end.
-LIAM-
So, logical to think, then, that there's two statues come to life here in the square with us, and perhaps a caster in the area as well.
-AABRIA-
Correct.
-LIAM-
Well, I'm still invisible.
So, Orym will grip the shield tight and try to hear anything in addition to the statues he can in the area.
-AABRIA-
So your attention is primarily back with the statues and the caster?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm saying as soon as that happened, like he was ready to start screaming around the corner.
But as soon as he hears that, he just hunkers down and listens as acutely as he can.
And the shield, newly-dubbed Sentinel Shield, attunes his senses.
So can I attempt to hear--
-AABRIA-
Yes, please make a perception check with advantage because that's how your shield works.
-LIAM-
That's how the shield works.
That is a 22.
-AABRIA-
With a 22, you get quiet and listen.
And it takes a little extra time to tune out all of the commotion, and Fy'ra's sort of screaming, and what sounds like the snarl of a large beast around the corner.
And when you hear it, footfalls not speeding up in pursuit and headed in your direction, but slinking back through puddles, ducking into the alley next to that large building.
-LIAM-
And I'll immediately start running at that sound.
-AABRIA-
Love it.
-LIAM-
I don't know if I can get there.
If I can, I'm going to try to stab at the air.
-AABRIA-
All right, take a swing at the dark.
-LIAM-
And I'm going use a superiority die to do a feinting attack, which will give me advantage on the attack, which I'm guessing would just make it a straight roll because they're invisible.
-AABRIA-
Straight roll.
-LIAM-
Come on, come on, come on.
Balls.
That is a 10 to hit.
-AABRIA-
Unfortunately, you swing out and miss.
-LIAM-
Action surge, going again.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, baby!
-AABRIA-
Let's go!
-LIAM-
Re-rolling my halfling natural one for a 20.
-AIMEE-
Woo, yeah!
-MATT-
Get it!
-ANJALI-
♪ Halfling on fire! ♪
-AABRIA-
You swing out with that first swing and you feel yourself catch a little bit of fabric and the little tug as you missed a body, but now you have a sense of what it is.
You've pulled this thing just a little bit off of its feet, and you swing out again and you catch something.
-LIAM-
I would say because I'm using a feinting attack to mess with them, after the first attack which whiffs, I hear where they are and then go (grunts) and then swing around because I'm trying to make them dodge out of the way.
So here's the fake, and then I swing around to catch them on this side.
And that is a six, six damage.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, beautiful.
-AIMEE-
Nice.
-AABRIA-
I didn't think my friend was going to get hit that fast.
-ANJALI-
Well played.
-AABRIA-
Tight, tight, tight.
-ROBBIE-
And because he took an action, did he just reveal himself?
-LIAM-
My invisibility's gone.
-ROBBIE-
It's gone, okay.
-LIAM-
As soon as you do a thing.
-AABRIA-
And you pull it back and you see blood on your blade, and you hear a, "(yelps) You little mongrel."
-ANJALI-
Oh shit.
-AIMEE-
I don't like that.
-AABRIA-
♪ Stagger back into the darkness. ♪ Opal, you're up.
-AIMEE-
Okay, question, do I see the person that's carrying me since we're both invisible now?
-AABRIA-
That's a very good question.
Shoot. Make an arcana check for me.
♪ Things I didn't consider before. ♪
-AIMEE-
17.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you know what? You absolutely do.
-AIMEE-
Oh man, I'm going to take a fucking risk and I hope it's worth it.
-AABRIA-
Oh, you're falling unconscious.
-AIMEE-
What? Can I not do it? Can I not cast a spell?
-ANJALI-
You're unconscious.
-AIMEE-
So what the fuck do I do? What's my turn for?
-AABRIA-
I need you to make a constitution saving throw to shake off this--
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was about to fight the rules.
-AABRIA-
I know, it's okay, it's okay.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Attack the rules.
-AIMEE-
17.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, boo. Yeah!
-AABRIA-
All right, with a 17, I'll say that you feel that wave of sleep.
And then you feel something in you pushing your consciousness away from that fog.
Pushing you clear and trying to interpose itself within you.
-AIMEE-
Oh, god. Okay.
-AABRIA-
(as Ted) "You're welcome!"
-AIMEE-
Oh, I couldn't see you.
I'm going to cast Word of Radiance.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
But before I cast that, above table top, does that damage the person if they're holding me?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Okay, great, so I'm going to do that.
I'm going to cast Word of Radiance, and I'm assuming, do I have to roll for that?
-AABRIA-
I'm going to make you roll with disadvantage because you're awake, but the source of your magic is now trying to body the effect that's putting you to sleep.
So your magic's not as effective right now as other things.
-AIMEE-
Oh, so what did you--? That was a 13, was the lowest one.
15's the highest, so 13.
-AABRIA-
So you go to cast.
What does Word of Radiance look like as you begin to cast it?
-AIMEE-
I think in this case, she wants to, A, call attention to herself because she's invisible.
So I'm assuming that that breaks the invisibility, if it's just a radiant source of light.
-AABRIA-
Technically, you're a thing being carried.
The rules for this I have bullshitted in a direction.
-AIMEE-
I know.
-AABRIA-
Yes, if this spell goes off, you can be seen.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
So yeah, it would just look like a big, loud, neon pink burst of light that would hopefully singe the person that is also holding me into letting me go.
-AABRIA-
Now I'm going to give you a choice.
Because this would have missed.
But it's a point blank attack.
So what's more important to you in this moment? The damage or the visibility?
-AIMEE-
Oh.
But the damage is not guaranteed to let me go, right?
-AABRIA-
You don't know.
-AIMEE-
You don't know.
I think, then, fuck it, the damage.
-AABRIA-
Okay, go ahead and roll the damage.
But no one sees anything.
-AIMEE-
The damage is five.
-AABRIA-
All right.
You hear a really gruff, low voice.
"(grunts) Why aren't you asleep?" And keeps moving forward.
-AIMEE-
Oh fuck.
-AABRIA-
All right, Dariax, you're up.
-MATT-
Oh, hi, yeah.
-AABRIA-
That's what you get for a natural one, son.
-MATT-
I know.
And I see everyone and I'm like: What's going on? Where's Opal? And I see that you turned into a wolf and go around the corner. (yells) I go running.
With my nice, trunk-like, squat dwarven legs that only carry me 25 feet, do I get around the corner at least, or do I not make it?
-AABRIA-
I'm going to let you get around the corner so you can see down.
You do the (screeching), and you can like-- Yeah, stare down the barrel of this alleyway.
-MATT-
Oh god.
-LIAM-
Little "Risky Business."
-AABRIA-
Yeah! Your pants are gone for some reason, but you're wearing a button down.
-MATT-
Weirdly on brand for him.
-AABRIA-
Kind of. Kind of.
-MATT-
All right, well, in looking at this view, I see a wolf.
I see you, you.
You're down a different alley or the same alley?
-LIAM-
I'm where you ran away from.
Well, mind palace.
I'm behind you, probably, at this point.
-MATT-
I'm not paying attention to you.
And do I see a flash of light?
-AABRIA-
Nope.
-ANJALI-
You see my hair on fire, so you know where I am.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, but no idea where Opal is.
-MATT-
Shit! I am going to go ahead and use my Hat of Disguise to turn myself to look like Opal.
-AIMEE-
Woo!
-ANJALI-
Yeah!
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
And go running in a different direction.
Just going like, (high-pitched scream).
-ANJALI-
Oh my god!
-MATT-
(high-pitched) They're trying to get me!
-ANJALI-
Oh my god, I love you so much.
-AABRIA-
If you don't have inspiration, please take it.
My god.
-MATT-
That's my turn.
-ANJALI-
You dumb dwarf!
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-MATT-
Do I roll a 20 to see the next complication?
-ANJALI-
Oh yes, please.
Oh yeah, I didn't have you roll complication.
That's fine, I'll let it go.
Because I forgot to do it, that's on me.
-MATT-
That's an eight.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, yes, a thing.
Hold on.
As you go tearing down in a different direction from where this chase is happening, you're looking over your shoulder like, "Oh no, where am I?" And you completely bash into just a random person.
Who's just like, "Ow, my god!" And just begins cussing and swearing and you get entangled with them.
Please make a strength saving throw.
-MATT-
You got it!
-AABRIA-
Actually, no, it's going to be athletics or acrobatics check.
-MATT-
Oh, I got it.
That would be an 11.
-AABRIA-
With an 11, this person, he's grabbing onto you to try to like, "What did you do?" And trying to pull themselves up, and you're able to extricate yourself as Opal.
-MATT-
(as Opal) Don't touch me, stranger! Ew!
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-AIMEE-
Really good.
-ANJALI-
You do a great Opal.
-AABRIA-
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, we're back up to the top. Dorian, you're up.
And the reason I gave that to you and not the next person is because it doesn't make sense because you're not running in the same direction.
-MATT-
Fair enough.
-ROBBIE-
You broke the rules.
-AABRIA-
No, I broke them because I keep forgetting what they are.
I don't know how to play D&amp;D.
-ROBBIE-
You broke the rules! So, from what I can see, have the ladies surpassed me or are they closer to Opal at this point with their movement speed?
-AABRIA-
They both have movement speeds a little bit faster than you, so they're a little bit ahead of you.
-ROBBIE-
So they're gaining on me.
-AABRIA-
They are past you.
-ROBBIE-
Right, and Orym's engagement back behind us?
-AABRIA-
You have no idea what Orym's doing.
He never came around the corner.
-ROBBIE-
Oh okay, so he's still back there.
-AABRIA-
Do you want to go look? Do you want to look as an action?
-ROBBIE-
If I could see him, I would have a reason to, but if I can't see him, I'm going to keep up with the chase.
-AABRIA-
You can look as an action.
-AIMEE-
No, don't do it.
-AABRIA-
Aren't you worried?
-ROBBIE-
I am worried, that's where my instincts are.
But all right, yeah, okay.
I'm going to stop.
I have ultimate faith in the ladies.
So I'm going to stop.
-ANJALI-
There's your first problem.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
I don't know, I got a dire wolf, you guys are sprinting, and you've got fire hair.
-ANJALI-
That's true, we're speedy.
-ROBBIE-
All right, so I'm thinking maybe they'll have this handled.
-AIMEE-
But Aabria wants it so bad.
-AABRIA-
Oh, no, it's okay, I've got stuff for all of you.
My puppos are coming up, it's good.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, yeah, I'm going to wonder-- But he was invisible, so I wouldn't, fuck, I'm overthinking this.
He's invisible, so I would naturally be thinking Orym is on the chase with us, like being a bad-ass, doing his thing.
-AABRIA-
I'll give you a freebie. Make a perception check.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
You get what I'm getting at?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, for sure, I get you.
-ROBBIE-
My gut says I want to go, but I don't have a reason to.
-AABRIA-
I got you, baby boy.
-ROBBIE-
Perception is 14.
-AABRIA-
You have heard everyone else coming up.
You can hear their footfalls before they show up.
And you've counted it out.
First Fy'ra ran up, and then you heard Fearne, and you even heard Dariax as he came around the corner and then muppetted out in a different direction, and you never heard Orym's footsteps.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, thanks for giving me a reason.
-AABRIA-
You're welcome, I got you.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, I'm going to let the ladies-- Save Opal and get my axe back! And I'm going to run back around the corner, full movement speed, 30 feet.
Does that put me enough to peek around the corner and see what's going down?
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah, you come back down.
And before you even use your full movement, you see my beautiful surprise for you.
Two massive, 10-foot tall, three-headed meat beasts.
-ROBBIE-
And do I see Orym fighting nothingness? Fighting the air as well?
-AABRIA-
There's a little-- There's something happening in the alley.
You hear it, you don't see it necessarily.
-ROBBIE-
Aw, shit, all right.
Do I have enough movement speed to get to the meat beast?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, but he's ducked into it.
-LIAM-
Meat beasts.
-ROBBIE-
Do I have enough movement speed to get to the meat beasts?
-AABRIA-
(low voice) Yeah, I want you to have that.
-ROBBIE-
Aw, fuck (chuckles).
Are they clearly bad? (laughter)
-ANJALI-
I mean, technically speaking, are meat beasts good?
-ROBBIE-
No, all right.
-AABRIA-
Do you think Orym cast Big Cool Meat Beasts?
-ROBBIE-
No, I don't.
And he's otherwise engaged.
Everything is fucked! I'm going to run in between the two meat beasts.
I'm going to run right smack in the middle of them, and I'm going to cast-- I'm going to cast-- Fuck, level two Thunderwave.
-AABRIA-
Good call.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-ROBBIE-
And that's a, yeah, 12 con save.
-AABRIA-
Only the one on the right makes it.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, okay.
3d8.
<i>Ocho</i>, I never roll the eights.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, get in here.
-AIMEE-
-- fucking dice.
-ROBBIE-
Mm! (sharp inhale) Mm.
Five, six, seven, eight.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
Okay, and the one that makes it takes half?
-ROBBIE-
That is correct.
And the one that didn't save gets pushed 10 feet-- wait, no, yes, 10 feet away from me.
-AABRIA-
Sweet, you ran in between them before they had fully moved out and away from the frame of this big building.
So the one that you pushed actually slams into the side of the building just a little bit.
And you see this nub tail that's carved onto its butt, And you see this nub tail that's carved onto its butt, hits it, and chips and shatters and it falls off.
So it's missing 12% of its donk off of that.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Of its what?
-MATT-
Donk.
-AIMEE-
Dong?
-AABRIA-
Donk.
-ROBBIE-
Thunderclap that booty?
-AABRIA-
Ew, you nasty.
-ROBBIE-
That's all I'm going to say.
-MATT-
There it is!
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (exclaiming)
Inspiration for a little nonsense.
All right, roll a d20.
-ROBBIE-
Mm-mm.
-ANJALI-
Oh, fuck.
-ROBBIE-
Who did I make this hard for?
-ANJALI-
But he's in the other direction.
-ROBBIE-
19.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Nothing happens for my sweet invisible friend who is going to take off and then use the dash action to go even farther.
-MATT-
Shit.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-AIMEE-
That's the one that's holding me?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, next up is Fy'ra Rai.
-ANJALI-
All right, so here's what I want to do.
-AABRIA-
Uh-huh.
-AIMEE-
Tell us.
-ANJALI-
I don't know how we feel.
And then you're going to tell me what is possible.
Since she's so close to me, now she's so close, I actually want to see if I-- I mean, you're huge, right?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, large.
-ANJALI-
I want to see if I can jump on her back, and we can--
-AABRIA-
That's a consent thing.
That has nothing to do with me.
-ANJALI-
What's your speed as a wolf?
-ASHLEY-
50 feet.
-ANJALI-
Your speed is 50? Her speed is 50, so I want to see if that would take a full action or--
-AABRIA-
To mount a dire? Yeah, mm-hmm.
-AIMEE-
(chuckles) Good idea, though.
-ROBBIE-
You better ride that wolf.
-ANJALI-
Is that worth it? Because I only have an action and movement.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ROBBIE-
Think of the imagery (laughs).
-ANJALI-
I am thinking of the imagery, and I'm trying to decide what's fucking sexier.
Let me ask you this.
If I hop on the dire wolf's back.
-AABRIA-
You do not get to use your movement in her stat.
That's not how that works, if that's what your about to ask.
Good try, though. Love it.
-LIAM-
You could fart your movement into her.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you could do a little toot, boop.
-ANJALI-
If I move-- okay, math.
If I move my normal amount, she will still catch up to me so I can jump on her then.
If I run and hold--
-AABRIA-
You're going to run and hold your action?
-ANJALI-
I can probably jump on her.
Because I don't know if we're going to catch up to the dude or not.
-AABRIA-
Once again, this is a consent thing.
And you don't speak dire wolf.
So this will be fun to see how it works out.
Is that what your plan is?
-ANJALI-
Yeah, so I'm going to bust a move forward.
-AABRIA-
Cool, you move your full speed?
-ANJALI-
And as I bust a move-- my full speed, which is 40 feet, I am going to again, perception, seeing.
Can I see anything? Opal, the thingy?
-AABRIA-
Are you using your action to look? Or are you holding your action to jump on?
-ANJALI-
Ah, fuck me.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Welcome to my fucking chase.
Oh, and on top of that--
-AIMEE-
This chase is rowdy.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I'm trying to be.
As you run down, you actually see that there are barrels and things.
So I actually need you to make a dexterity-- no, we'll call it an acrobatics check to navigate around it as you're continuing down.
-ANJALI-
(laughs) That's a 24, we're okay.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're fine.
-AIMEE-
Yay!
-ANJALI-
She's parkouring off things.
She's climbing over the barrels, jumping off things.
-AABRIA-
Some guy's like, "My cabbages!" As you parkour over a big cabbage thing.
-ANJALI-
But I hear this galloping behind me, and I just know, I just know it's my girl Fearne.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
So I'm going to hold, and look back behind her, and say: May I? And that's all.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful, okay, well.
Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
-ANJALI-
18, plus yeah, 18.
-AABRIA-
No, there's nothing to add.
Fearne, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-AABRIA-
You hear a "May I?" (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Mother, may I?
-ASHLEY-
I-- I-- I look up at (laughs) Fy'ra Rai-- (barks) You know, try to-- (laughter)
-AABRIA-
A woof of consent.
-ASHLEY-
I try to just make my path a little bit over to her to sort of--
-AABRIA-
Yeah, for sure.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Swinging out a step to make sure that you're like--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, getting a little closer.
-AABRIA-
Totally fine.
-ASHLEY-
Like, yeah, you got to jump on.
Let's go.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, good to go on?
-AABRIA-
Let's do a dumb roll anyway.
Give me another acrobatics check, which I'm sure you're terrible at because you're a goddamn monk.
-ANJALI-
I'm a 23.
-AABRIA-
Okay, it's really pretty.
It's very cool. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Great, great.
-AABRIA-
What does it look like? You tell me.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I say, "May I?" And as she runs by me, I run just two steps to catch up with her, I run just two steps to catch up with her, swing one leg over, just grab a little bit of tuft of her fur, and I pat her on the side, and I go: Ride!
-AIMEE-
Whoa!
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
It's like not-great CG Legolas in Lord of the Rings where he just grabs the edge of the horse and swings it over.
-AABRIA-
No! (laughs) You made it uncool!
-ANJALI-
I didn't have to use cables, and I'm wearing high-heeled boots! I'm wearing these, goddamn it.
That's sexy.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-LIAM-
In my imagination, it's way better than that.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, right?
-ASHLEY-
Me too, me too.
It was way better.
-MATT-
I'm just being a dick.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my gosh.
Okay, I do have a question.
-AABRIA-
Yes?
-ASHLEY-
So my wildfire spirit.
Where'd it go, where'd it go, where'd it go? Would that be considered-- to command the wildfire spirit, is that an action on my turn right now?
-AABRIA-
Technically, your wildfire spirit go just after-- Oh, to command Mister into being a wildfire spirit will take your action.
-ASHLEY-
Will take my action, okay.
(grunts) I have an idea, but I need two moves on a turn.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to keep running towards the Palo Santo sandalwood smell that I can to my girl.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah?
-ASHLEY-
And just keep trying to book it.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so using a dash for your action? What's your action going to be?
-ASHLEY-
It's 50 feet-- my action is if I'm somewhat close, I do want to try to take a bite attack.
-AABRIA-
You're not going to get close enough, because this person used their dash to get even farther away.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, dash, dash, dash.
-AABRIA-
They moved more than, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay, I'll dash.
(wide "A" sound) Dash.
-AABRIA-
You dash.
-ASHLEY-
My Michigander's coming out.
-ANJALI-
Come on, Dasher, Dasher.
Instead of saying ride, I said: Dash!
-ASHLEY-
Dash! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Okay, that's enough Avatar for one day.
Yeah, go ahead.
-ASHLEY-
I'll dash.
-AABRIA-
All right, so you dash.
Go ahead and give me a perception check as you get closer.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. (sighs)
-AABRIA-
I'm not going to count this as part of it because you are just breathing in through your nose, and you can catch a good whiff of that.
-ASHLEY-
That's a natural one.
-AABRIA-
(gasping)
Amazing.
So in the heat of this.
I mean, you know that you've gone so far.
Like, what couldn't you catch? But you don't have a strong sense, especially now that this alley is more full of boxes, and maybe they climbed up on something.
You don't have a strong bead on where they are, but you know you have to be in proximity just by how much you can move in a round.
-ASHLEY-
Okay. (sighs)
-AABRIA-
But that's your action.
-ASHLEY-
That's my action.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, roll a d20.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
(like Legolas) They're taking the warlock to Isengard.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh no, that's a one.
-AABRIA-
Oh, beautiful.
-AIMEE-
Buddy.
-AABRIA-
Thank you.
-ASHLEY-
Who's after me, I'm sorry.
-AABRIA-
Oh, no, those are my buddies around the corner.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's a good thing!
-MATT-
Yes, yes, yes!
-AIMEE-
You did a good!
-ANJALI-
Hercules, Hercules, Fearne-ules, Fearne-ules.
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-AABRIA-
So my big boys.
-ANJALI-
Trip and die.
-AABRIA-
It is difficult terrain.
However, they're in melee with a thing to bite.
So, it's not really going to affect them, as they turn.
And you ran to <i>them</i>.
And they're both going to take big old attacks at you.
-ROBBIE-
But isn't one of them out of melee range now if he got knocked back?
-AABRIA-
Okay, it's going to walk the 10 feet--
-ROBBIE-
Fuck!
-AABRIA-
-- back over.
(laughter)
Even with difficult terrain, it had more than 20 feet of movement.
It scootches back over.
All right.
The lowest one is an 18.
-ROBBIE-
(blows raspberry) Both.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, sweet.
Oh god.
-ROBBIE-
Uh-oh.
-LIAM-
Oh boy.
-ROBBIE-
I'm a-feared.
-AABRIA-
You're going to take 16 points-- (gasping)
-- of piercing damage.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
As these heads descend on you, three on each.
Snap, snap, snap.
-ROBBIE-
Fuck!
-AABRIA-
And they just absolutely cover you.
You hear the crunch and movement.
I don't know if you're too cool to make an ouch sound.
-ROBBIE-
No.
-AABRIA-
Shit got real around the corner.
-LIAM-
Was that from one meat beast?
-AABRIA-
No, it was both.
-LIAM-
Both meat beasts.
-AABRIA-
It was combined.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
I am super fucked up.
-AABRIA-
You're fine, this is fine.
-ROBBIE-
This was a bad idea.
-AABRIA-
My boys' go, and they roll.
You're fine.
Next up is Orym.
Opal, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
I do hear the sound of my friend, so I curse at the darkness and wheel around and come running back.
If I can get to one, if I see one engaged with him-- No, yeah, if either of them that are engaged, whichever one I can get to--
-AABRIA-
Are you leaving melee range?
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's fine, I'll risk it.
-AABRIA-
Okay, cool.
Does a 21 hit you?
-LIAM-
It does, indeed.
-AIMEE-
Fuck.
-MATT-
You got this.
-AIMEE-
Meanwhile, you just hit a wall somewhere.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
(thunk)
-AABRIA-
You turn and run away, and you feel a hand grab around the meat of your tricep.
And a sudden burst of blinding pain as an Inflict Wounds catches you--
-LIAM-
Great, that's great.
-AABRIA-
-- for 11 points of necrotic damage.
-LIAM-
Great.
-AABRIA-
I rolled very low.
-ROBBIE-
Oh boy.
-ANJALI-
Stop hurting my babies.
-LIAM-
I run into the fray.
And run up to one of the beasts with its fangs into my friend, and I'm going to use another superiority die and do a goading attack.
I'm going to try to stab it in the eye and draw its ire on me.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, make an attack.
-LIAM-
I didn't roll-- Whoever, that invisible person should've taken more damage.
I didn't roll--
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah, roll the extra damage.
-LIAM-
-- superiority die.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
-LIAM-
Just one. Just one.
-AABRIA-
That's not nothing, they're a caster.
They're probably not made of hit points.
-LIAM-
Okay, so for that attack to the beast, I rolled a 19.
-AABRIA-
Hits.
-LIAM-
Okay, and that's--
-AABRIA-
It's kind of hard to miss.
-LIAM-
Six plus-- 12 points of damage, and it is at disadvantage if it tries to attack Dorian.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-LIAM-
Because it is now pissed at me.
-AABRIA-
Okay, do you want to describe what that attack is?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I run up and kick off of Dorian's knee, and then just go (stabbing), and stick it in the eye, and land.
-AABRIA-
You crush and punch in this thing's eyes that are unblinking, but it makes this gravely howl as something that knows that its roughly beast shape reacts in the way that you would expect it to.
And it shakes its head, one of its heads violently, and snaps.
And you drop back down to the ground.
As that head follows you down, it looks at you.
And then the next head turns to you, and the third, and that low grumble that's more like construction than like an animal's snarl fills your chest and makes you vibrate as this thing has turned its entire attention onto you.
-LIAM-
Here, boy. (sighs)
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-LIAM-
End of the turn.
-AABRIA-
Okay, roll a d20 for me.
-LIAM-
Nine.
-AABRIA-
All right.
A gift for Opal.
-AIMEE-
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
Oh no, no, no. It's--
-AIMEE-
I know, I know! Goddamn it, I know.
-LIAM-
Feel bad, Robbie. Feel bad.
-ROBBIE-
I know.
I came in to help, and I feel like I fucked it all up.
-LIAM-
No, not at all.
They would've come after me on my [inaudible].
-MATT-
We're not down and out yet!
-AIMEE-
What can I see without looking?
-AABRIA-
What do you mean?
-AIMEE-
Without taking an action of looking, what can I see?
-MATT-
"What can I see without looking?" (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
What can I see without rolling?
-MATT-
I just love that sentence.
-AABRIA-
It was so metaphysical.
You are just--
-AIMEE-
Which way am I laid, I suppose?
-AABRIA-
You're up over the booty meat.
You're looking back, and you can actually see, probably eight feet away from you, you see a massive dire wolf.
-AIMEE-
Cool.
-AABRIA-
With Fy'ra.
-AIMEE-
I would love to cast Misty Step.
So I can teleport to the back of the dire wolf.
-AABRIA-
You can certainly try.
Once again, you feel--
-LIAM-
That's cool.
-AABRIA-
Actually, no, this is the complication.
I need you to make an arcana check.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
Natural 20, baby.
(cheering)
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
Not that that's helpful now.
-AABRIA-
No, it absolutely is, because I was going to put your magic to sleep.
-AIMEE-
Oh, thank god.
-AABRIA-
You feel Ted deep within you.
She's interposed herself between this magical effect and you so you can stay awake.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
And she is struggling.
You feel inside you as she takes a knee.
So close to falling to whatever this magical effect is.
And she holds onto it a little longer, reaching down into the ground into that connection between the two of you and preserving it so you can cast Misty Step.
-AIMEE-
Yes, okay, do I have to roll for that? Or is it just automatic?
-AABRIA-
It just happens.
-AIMEE-
Yes! Okay, so I have misty stepped onto the back of the dire wolf, which I'm assuming is large enough to handle both me and Fy'ra Rai.
-ASHLEY-
You're a tid bit.
-AABRIA-
You're great.
You are, in fact, a tid bit.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AIMEE-
And now, am I not invisible anymore, because I've lost contact with this?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-AIMEE-
Okay! Now who's chasing whom? (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Yes, yes!
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
Okay, all right, go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
-MATT-
Fuck me up!
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
No.
-MATT-
Fuck me up.
-AIMEE-
That's a 10.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
That's a 10.
Nobody? Okay.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so Dorian, you're continuing in a direction?
-MATT-
At this point, after I hit the person, pushed off, I look back and gauge what's going on.
What do I see?
-AABRIA-
You're down a different corridor.
So you see boxes and barrels.
You can hear the sounds of crushing and colliding and monstrous things happening around the corner from you, where you can hear Fearne growling and bigger, snarlier, more terrifying rumbles in the ground back in the plaza from whence you came.
-MATT-
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and run back towards, I guess, the more dangerous sound at the plaza, while shouting, in my best Opal impression-- (laughter)
Great, guys, they took the decoy! (laughter)
The plan's working! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Honestly, kind of brilliant.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
It is.
-MATT-
And using my movement to run back into the plaza.
-AABRIA-
Did you copy her entire outfit?
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
Down to the heels that I'm assuming you're wearing?
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
Cool, okay.
So it's that same stupid 10 where you're coming around a corner and I need to you to make a dexterity save to avoid clipping the side as you move back in the direction.
-MATT-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
So as you run back--
-MATT-
That is a 16.
-AABRIA-
You are actually legitimately incredible in heels.
You're good.
-AIMEE-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
All that time as Tharla Starr.
-AIMEE-
It's that Tharla Starr practice.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
You learned a thing or two.
-AABRIA-
And you come back through--
-MATT-
It wasn't a crush that I was keeping an eye on her.
I just liked her skill.
-AABRIA-
-- and announce, "They took the decoy." Go ahead and make a deception check.
-MATT-
All right.
-AABRIA-
And I'm not going to make this part of your turn.
Just how someone else is going to take it.
Like my other spellcaster, who went, "What?"
-MATT-
That is a... deception, 21.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
-AIMEE-
Whoop, whoop.
-AABRIA-
Noted.
Okay, so you ran back and yelled.
What do you want to do for your action?
-MATT-
Am I back towards the plaza? Do I see anything?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're at the edge of the plaza.
-MATT-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You can see-- You know what? I wouldn't call it a fight, because that would assume that it was kind of fair.
You see two giant beasts and then Orym and Dorian standing between them, interacting with them.
I guess it looks like Orym's fighting.
It looks like Dorian's getting his full ass handed to him.
-MATT-
Oh shit, how far from me is Dorian?
-AABRIA-
Oh, you have to cross the plaza.
It would take your full movement.
-MATT-
Can't help you now.
Then I'm going to use the rest of my action to dash and get up close.
Can I get within-- See if I can interpose myself between Dorian and whatever the nearest creature is, and be like: (like Opal) No, I'm your target.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
I love it, amazing.
Roll a d20 for me.
-MATT-
Okay.
12.
-AABRIA-
All right.
No bad effect.
Dorian, you're up.
-ROBBIE-
(groans)
-AABRIA-
This is going great for you.
-ROBBIE-
(groans) Not going according to plan.
-AABRIA-
What are you talking about? My plan was to attack you with big old puppos.
-ROBBIE-
That's true.
How big are these stone guys? How tall?
-AABRIA-
10 feet.
-ROBBIE-
10 feet.
-ASHLEY-
They're big boys.
-AABRIA-
They're big boys.
-LIAM-
I am 30% of their size.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Oh, buddy!
-ASHLEY-
Hey!
-ANJALI-
We need him.
-ROBBIE-
And is disengaging my action?
-AABRIA-
Yes, it is.
-ROBBIE-
And it affords them an opportunity strike?
-AABRIA-
No, a disengage prevents an opportunity attack.
-AIMEE-
Oh, nice.
-AABRIA-
That's the whole point of it.
-LIAM-
But it's your action.
-ROBBIE-
Aww.
-AABRIA-
But you'll still have your movement.
-ROBBIE-
Right, yeah.
-MATT-
Don't worry. You got a healer in heels next to you.
A heeler.
-AABRIA-
A healer in heels.
-ROBBIE-
I'm so fucked, I can't do anything.
-LIAM-
Do what you got to do.
-ROBBIE-
I got to help myself.
I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.
-AABRIA-
So do you disengage or do you cast Cure Wounds?
-ROBBIE-
(groans) Oh my god.
What did they hit me for last time? 17?
-ROBBIE-
Fuck you, I am going to disengage.
-AABRIA-
Good call.
-ASHLEY-
GTFO, yes.
-ROBBIE-
And I am going to use my movement speed to get as far away from the encounter as I can.
Maybe make my way to Dariax.
Is he close enough?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I'm going to say that you have an opportunity to cross Dariax as you're running.
-ROBBIE-
Then I'm not going to go as far away as I can.
I'm just going to get to Dariax.
And I'm going to give Orym a wistful look as I leave, because I feel fucking bad about bailing.
And that ends my turn.
-AABRIA-
Okay, roll a d20.
-ROBBIE-
16.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
High, it's fine.
-MATT-
Just pointing out, once again, you're running towards Opal.
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Fuck!
-AABRIA-
That's right, you're running towards Opal.
Good call, good call.
-ROBBIE-
How did you get away?
-MATT-
What?
-ROBBIE-
How did you get away from being kidnapped?
-MATT-
I wasn't kidnapped, Opal was kidnapped.
-ROBBIE-
You are Op-- what?
-MATT-
What?
-ROBBIE-
What?!
-MATT-
Oh!
-ROBBIE-
Oh!
-MATT-
All right, there we go.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Brilliant!
-ROBBIE-
Thank you for reminding me.
-AABRIA-
So good.
So our main invisible baddie, now one Opal lighter, is going to turn around and looks and sees you.
-AIMEE-
Hi, bitch.
-AABRIA-
And you hear a little (spits).
-AIMEE-
Oh fuck.
-AABRIA-
"Stay down this time."
-AIMEE-
Wait, can I cast Shield?
-AABRIA-
No, you do not have reactions.
-AIMEE-
Why not?
-AABRIA-
Because I said at the beginning--
-ROBBIE-
It's a chase!
-AABRIA-
-- it's a chase.
-ASHLEY-
Dang it!
-AIMEE-
Fuck.
Okay, what do I do?
-AABRIA-
Make a dexterity saving throw.
-ANJALI-
Come on, girl.
-AABRIA-
With disadvantage because you don't see it.
-AIMEE-
Oh, well, thank god.
-AABRIA-
I don't know what that means (laughs).
-AIMEE-
It was a 20.
-AABRIA-
Oh no.
-AIMEE-
18.
-AABRIA-
Nice.
-AIMEE-
(relieved sigh) I shouldn't have celebrated so quickly.
-AABRIA-
Why?
-AIMEE-
I feel good now.
No, I was saying, that could've been real bad.
That could've been real bad.
-AABRIA-
You hear that little dart sound.
I'm going to assume you just duck behind Fy'ra.
-AIMEE-
Oh god.
-ANJALI-
Oh, it--
-AABRIA-
No, it doesn't hit you instead.
That thing doesn't bend. It's not Wanted.
-ANJALI-
Because I was also going to say I have Deflect Missiles for a friend thing.
-AABRIA-
That's right, which is a reaction, which you can't use.
-AIMEE-
Damn it.
-ANJALI-
It doesn't matter, because you rolled an 18! You killed it!
-AABRIA-
And you hear footsteps as this person continues to run away.
-ANJALI-
Away?
-AABRIA-
Away.
-AIMEE-
Away from us?
-AABRIA-
Ooh, and a one.
Yeah, away from y'all.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-ANJALI-
Great.
So--
-AABRIA-
Hold on.
Fy'ra, you're up, one second.
Where is my tab? There it is.
-ASHLEY-
Do we let her go? Do we fight?
-ANJALI-
She's about to say something happens.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so the footsteps carry away.
Now you're at the end of the alleyway.
And even though it's late, it's not the dead of night.
It spills out into a street where you see people are walking back and forth, and wagons are being pulled.
So there's now cross traffic is your complication.
-ANJALI-
I mean, we've heard everything.
We've got Opal.
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ANJALI-
I'm going to say: Let him go. Go back to the others.
Instead of pursuing him through the people, because I don't want to fuck with the people.
-AABRIA-
Okay, works for me.
-ANJALI-
So can I hold everything? And just speak for now and not use my movement and not use-- Because I'm on the back of a dire wolf.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, for sure.
-ANJALI-
She's going to move faster than I am.
-AABRIA-
And I will allow if you want to use a reaction or something later.
You've held your potential in reserve to do something.
-ANJALI-
I'm going to hold onto my potential.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, good job.
(laughs) Roll a d20.
-ANJALI-
14, although it's on top of other dice.
-AABRIA-
Totally fine. Fearne, you're up.
No complication.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so-- Yes, I listen.
Sort of huffing and growling and (snorts).
Bloodthirsty.
Turn around and start booking it back--
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
-- to our people, because-- (sighs) We got to-- (groans) This is tough.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
Um, um, um, um.
-AABRIA-
So my question is: Do you officially give up the chase?
-ASHLEY-
Oh! Ooh, I don't want to, you guys.
I don't want to.
-AABRIA-
Give me a perception check.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
19.
-AABRIA-
You still smell him.
You could catch him.
He's not that far.
And you can pick his scent out of the dozens of people in the street.
If you run away now, you'll never know why she was targeted.
-ASHLEY-
Booking it towards him.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Going towards the smell.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, baby.
-AABRIA-
Chase rules still up, let's go!
-ASHLEY-
Yep, yep, yep.
-ROBBIE-
Continue.
-ASHLEY-
Going, going, going.
-AABRIA-
With a 19, yeah, you can catch up entirely.
You slide out into the street, dire wolf drift, and even though there are people around, you know exactly where this person is.
You can smell the sweat and anxiety on him.
You can attack.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Who wants it, who wants it? Okay.
(relieved exhale)
-MATT-
You are blessed, you get to add a d4 to that.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I mean, that was pretty high.
Okay, okay.
That would be-- Let me pull up my wolf.
25.
-AABRIA-
Absolutely hits.
What do you think this is? It's a guy, he's a guy.
He's a guy made of flesh.
-ASHLEY-
He's a guy, he's a guy.
Okay, so.
What I would like to do--
-AABRIA-
So what are you hitting with? Is this a chomp? Is this a swipe?
-ASHLEY-
I'm trying to just grab and knock him prone, and just get at his throat above him.
-AABRIA-
So this is more of a grapple than an attack.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to attack.
I want to kill this-- No, no, no, I want to!
-AABRIA-
What do you want?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, it's a grapple.
-AABRIA-
I'm not telling you what to pick.
I'm just saying--
-ASHLEY-
It's a grapple, it's a grapple.
-AABRIA-
Are you sure? You don't want to do a chomp? You wants do a chomp?
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to do a chomp.
I'm going to do a chomp.
(cheering)
Sorry, sorry.
-ROBBIE-
That was a rollercoaster.
-AABRIA-
Why are you apologizing? (laughter)
-LIAM-
(car screeching)
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay.
-AABRIA-
This pleases me to no end.
-ASHLEY-
(growls)
-AABRIA-
Make it count.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
That is-- math in the moment.
Holy moly.
10 points of damage.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Describe what the attack looks like.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so with my ladies on my back, I want to take a leap in the air to where I think he is and grab him at the back of his head with my mouth and my teeth, and pull him down.
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah.
-ASHLEY-
And just face maul, on the face.
-AABRIA-
I like that a lot.
And I want to reward you letting me goad you into doing a chomp.
And you leap out for that, where you can hear the ragged breathing as this person's out of breath and was just carrying another person so you know exactly where his head is, and you grab it.
And in your spin to grab and tackle and slam him down, you hear a crunch.
And I know you only said you did 10 points of damage, but you heard a neck snap.
-ANJALI-
Oh no.
-AIMEE-
(squeals)
-ASHLEY-
I'm just going to stay over him.
And just drooling, above his face.
Like (snarling).
Just waiting.
-AABRIA-
The other two of you don't see anything yet.
Because the magical artifact is still doing its job.
But you can see in that point of interaction, looking down over dire Fearne's shoulders, blood as it pools up and away from the invisible source and runs and drips free.
And you hear sounds: a whimper of pain and gurgling.
And then nothing at all.
-AIMEE-
Uh-huh.
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Um.
I'm going to take my actions now because--
-AABRIA-
Yeah, what do you want to do? Go ahead.
-ANJALI-
I leap off her back and I just smack her on the back to let her know it's okay, I get it, whatever.
Don't worry about it. Well done.
I tell you all of these things with two slaps on the back.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! Vibes.
-ANJALI-
I got you, girl.
-AABRIA-
Non-verbal communication is important.
-ANJALI-
And I dash back.
I use all my everything to dash back to the direction of the other battle.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Sweet.
Yeah, you have a ton movement and with a full dash, you're able to get right up in the mix.
-ANJALI-
Right up in the mix. So where-- How-- Am I around the corner? Am I--
-AABRIA-
No. If you want to, you can get all the way back to where the fight proper is happening with Orym, with one of the bandersnatches.
-ANJALI-
I would like to be out of melee.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you can get as far as you want.
So you can see that maybe 15 or 20 feet away from that are Opal, actually.
-ANJALI-
Right.
-AABRIA-
Opal and Dorian.
And then Orym is in melee.
-AIMEE-
(silly voice) How'd you get here?
-ANJALI-
And I would like to get somewhere close enough that at least those meat--
-AIMEE-
Spider-Man.
-ANJALI-
-- puppets can see me.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, they can see you.
-ANJALI-
Statues? what are they? Meat guys? Meat things?
-AABRIA-
They're not meat.
They are porphyry stones, like extra hard.
-ANJALI-
But we've been calling them--
-AIMEE-
Meat beasts.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, meat beasts.
The musculature of them would suggest that.
-ANJALI-
The porphyry must meat beats. Whatever.
Yeah, sweet.
It's a good album.
So I just want to be close enough that they see me too as a potential target to pull focus.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
I'm going to say that at this point, the chase is over.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
-AABRIA-
And we're in normal initiative now.
-AIMEE-
Cool.
-ANJALI-
Wait, so did I need to use my-- Okay, never mind.
-AABRIA-
I mean, you still would've had to dash to get all the way over there.
-ANJALI-
Right, but that's an action and that's everything.
That's a movement. Is that my movement, my action, and my bonus action if the chase is over?
-AABRIA-
Since the chase is over from here--
-ANJALI-
From here. Okay.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
So I will allow it, you're in normal initiative rules now.
So you used your movement.
Are you using Step of the Wind to give yourself extra movement?
-ANJALI-
Oh yeah. I see this.
Okay, so that is using-- Hey, how does this work? Why won't it show me?
-AABRIA-
Who's ever played a monk before? Who could know?
-ANJALI-
Bonus action.
Okay, great, great, great.
-ASHLEY-
Marisha!
-ANJALI-
So, yes, I'm going to spend one ki point to use dash as my bonus action.
-AABRIA-
There you go, and now you still have your action left.
-ANJALI-
Still have my action yet.
Can I hit him? Yeah.
I am going to--
-AABRIA-
You slide past Dorian and other Opal.
-ANJALI-
Okay, and how much space do I have between-- Where is he in between the meat things, beasts?
-AABRIA-
Directly in melee with the one on the left, and the one on the right is about 10 feet away.
-ANJALI-
And I am, how close? How much--
-AABRIA-
Where do you want to be? You can't be in melee with both of them.
You have to pick left or right.
-ANJALI-
Right.
I will pick--
-AABRIA-
Orym's on the left guy.
-ANJALI-
Sorry?
-AABRIA-
Orym's on the left.
-ANJALI-
I will pick the one that is engaging with Orym and I will-- I'm going to go into three-point hero stance and I'm going to punch the ground.
And as the ground happens, sort of you see this eruption of lava come from the stones in the ground and snake up as I cast Lava Whip.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
To fucking--
-AIMEE-
Whoa!
Lava Whip?
-AABRIA-
Whip.
-AIMEE-
Lava Whip, whip.
-AABRIA-
It's not a Cool Whip.
-AIMEE-
No. It's a Lava Whip.
-ANJALI-
There's nothing cool about a Lava Whip.
So creature that I can see within 30 feet, it must make a dexterity saving throw.
-AABRIA-
Oh, good. These are not dextrous.
It got a natural one.
-ANJALI-
Boom!
-ASHLEY-
Ooh!
-ANJALI-
The creature takes--
-AABRIA-
It's like, "(confused noise)."
-ANJALI-
-- 3d10 bludgeoning damage.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
And I am going to attempt to knock it prone as well.
And I am going to attempt to knock it prone as well.
I shouldn't say attempt it.
It gets knocked prone.
-AABRIA-
Okay!
-ANJALI-
3d10. 10.
-AABRIA-
No one knows what a 10 is shaped like. You're good.
-ANJALI-
Five, 10.
Four. So 19.
And it basically wraps up around it and yanks it off its feet.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
It is prone.
-AIMEE-
Yankity yank.
-ANJALI-
Don't talk back.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Don't talk back.
-AABRIA-
That got me because it was like: How do I explain? I can't talk back.
(laughter) So yeah, this whip of lava comes up and slashes through.
You actually shear off half of its right side and its back legs.
So it doesn't just damage it, it cleaves it.
So now the left guy's a tripod.
And from that, it snakes around that back leg and pulls it out from under, and this thing and clatters down into the ground.
It breaks the stone under your feet, but it's down and a much more manageable height for you, too.
Love it. Beautiful.
This thing is hurt.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
-AABRIA-
It is having a bad time.
-ANJALI-
I am angry.
-MATT-
You, Laura Bailey, and B. Dave all have the same action economy bargaining spirit in you and I respect it so much.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!
-ANJALI-
Can I buy an E?
-ASHLEY-
But, but, but, but!
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-MATT-
I love it so much.
-ANJALI-
What can I do with my action?
-AABRIA-
Vibes. All right.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
So my left most guy is going to spend half of-- He's prone, so he's going to spend half of his movement getting up, and he would love, love, love to do a chomp at the one that absolutely wrecked his entire life.
However, that goading strike.
-LIAM-
Well, it can, but it would be a disadvantage.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
It can also eat me.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
It's gonna.
With a natural 19.
-LIAM-
Yeah, that hits.
-AABRIA-
It does a chomp right down into you.
It can barely stand on both of its legs, as it just sort of-- All three faces descend on you.
It's going to do nine points of piercing damage.
-LIAM-
Got it.
Please make a strength saving throw.
Ope, that's not a d20.
That is a five.
-ANJALI-
Aren't you blessed?
-LIAM-
Nope.
-ASHLEY-
Didn't you get an inspiration or something?
-ANJALI-
Didn't you get blessed or something, or inspiration or anything?
-ASHLEY-
Sorry, we're trying to bargain.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
I love bargaining.
This is fine for me because you're going to want to as two different heads get you in a grapple, and you are lifted up off of the ground and you're now between two dogs' teeth and they're going to play tug-of-war next round.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-MATT-
That's fine.
-AABRIA-
It's fine.
Okay. The one on the right that has-- It's missing a little bit of its donk, but is otherwise unaffected, is going to run forward, and yeah, it's going to attack-- Ooh, Opal? Which one? Where are you right now, by the way? Did you get in the melee range with the left guy?
-ANJALI-
I don't think I did, because I was using my ranged 30-foot.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so you're still back with the homies over here?
-ANJALI-
I would say I'm at least 25 feet away.
-AABRIA-
Okay. You're the biggest threat, so it's going to come for you, then.
Does a 19 hit?
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Three angry, angry mouths descend on you and they do seven points of piercing damage.
I need you to make--
-ANJALI-
'Tis but a flesh wound!
-AABRIA-
I need you to make a strength saving throw.
-AIMEE-
But a flesh wound!
-ANJALI-
23.
-AABRIA-
It tries to grab you and worry into you, but you're able to slip your body out.
Okay. That's it.
Next up is Orym.
-LIAM-
All right, well, I use a bonus action to do-- what's it? Second Wind, and regain 12 points.
-MATT-
Slick.
-ROBBIE-
Whoa.
-AABRIA-
Nice.
-AIMEE-
Wow.
-AABRIA-
Good call. Good call.
-AIMEE-
That's nifty.
-LIAM-
And then I'm just going to take a swing at the one that I did the most damage to that she just beat the shit out of, because I'm grappled, but I can still swing, right? I just can't move.
-AABRIA-
Yes, absolutely.
-LIAM-
I would have two grapples to beat.
I'm not going to mess with that.
That hits. That is a 23.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god, absolutely.
-AIMEE-
Ey-oh!
-ANJALI-
Boom!
-LIAM-
And that is nine points of damage.
Just dragged across the face of one of the two faces.
-AABRIA-
Don't describe it now.
How do you want to do this? (cheering)
-LIAM-
So I reach out and just drag the blade across the eyes of one of them, and see it reel back in pain, and see both of them reel in pain a bit, and swing the blade around in my hand, and just try to jam as hard as I can into the face of the other one, even though it's stone, even though it's holding me.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
And then hopefully get lower to the ground.
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow!
-AABRIA-
As this thing, the thing that you knock out of it, you don't hit a brain.
You've just sort of destroyed the magic holding it together.
And the amount of damage that you've done, you push in and then you feel it give way as it crumbles.
And you just slide to the ground on this pile of gravel as this thing, just sort of-- It unmakes itself around you and under you.
And you just scoot down and scooch.
I'll say you slide 10 feet towards your friends.
Just a little, wee!
-LIAM-
I will use my movement to walk it off.
Walk it off. Walk it off.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vibes.
-LIAM-
And put Fy'ra Rai and I between myself and the remaining creature.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
Love it.
-LIAM-
For the moment.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Before Opal's up, the real Opal-- Fake Opal, Dariax.
-MATT-
Yeah?
-AABRIA-
Please make a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage.
-MATT-
Totally. All right, let's do this.
That's not good.
That's a little better, but it's disadvantage. It's not good.
I'm going to go ahead and use my Favored by the Gods sorcerer ability to go ahead and add...
15.
-AABRIA-
You're hit by this.
However, however-- (laughter)
That weird sateen jacket that she wears, it's a little open on the sleeve as you see a tiny dart with purple fletching buries itself into the sleeve, but actually misses the flesh of your arm by just millimeters.
-AIMEE-
Noice.
-MATT-
(like Opal) Ah! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
What a nightmare.
Sweet. All right.
Opal, you're up.
-AIMEE-
Okay, so I really want to help, but I also want to know why he's chasing me, why he wanted to kidnap me.
So I'm going to step off of the dire wolf, and because I can see-- What? Oh.
Because I can see the trickle of blood on the whatever, I can sort of guesstimate where--
-AABRIA-
Oh, you have a very strong sense of the fact that dire Fearne's teeth aren't all the way shut.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
That whatever she's biting, she's got right in the center of her mouth.
-AIMEE-
Okay, great.
So I'm just going to guesstimate that it's his chest and I'm going to just straddle him.
Not sit on him, but straddle and pull out my two daggers and go right up to its throat, and hopefully, or maybe ask, because I don't know if it can talk, he can talk, but ask: Why are you chasing me? Can he talk?
-AABRIA-
Make an intimidation check.
-AIMEE-
I mean, I can be intimidating.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. I believe that.
-AIMEE-
That's a plus five.
Okay. So that is a 14.
-AABRIA-
You lean in and your voice drips with anger and rage and confusion, and the emotions of all of your weeks of travel and all of your weird conversations that you're having today and everything that's inside you right now--
-AIMEE-
Just not having control over what happens to me.
-AABRIA-
And you lean in and get really close with that dagger and realize you don't hear anything.
-AIMEE-
Fuck!
-AABRIA-
And the blood flow in that mouth, in Fearne's mouth right now, it's not flowing.
It was a puncture and it stopped.
-AIMEE-
So, it's dead?
-AABRIA-
He's dead.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
I apologize.
-AIMEE-
No, no.
-AABRIA-
No, it was great.
-ROBBIE-
You killed our only witness!
-LIAM-
That's not true.
That's not true.
-AABRIA-
It's not true.
-ANJALI-
You're good.
-AABRIA-
You did great.
-ANJALI-
You did good.
-ASHLEY-
I did what I wanted.
-AIMEE-
I did what I said I was going to do.
-LIAM-
It's D&D; I can do what I want.
-ROBBIE-
Do what I want.
-ANJALI-
I do what I want, whatever. Whatever.
-AIMEE-
But I feel like Opal is still so fucking full of rage that she's going to take one of her daggers and fucking pierce it into that person's chest and just slide down just because she's so angry.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
And can I try to do a thing that may not be possible? Whatever ring he was wearing that made him invisible, can I steal it?
-AABRIA-
You know what? You didn't see a ring.
-AIMEE-
I didn't see him pull it on and off?
-AABRIA-
That would be in the front of him and you were over his shoulder.
So you actually don't know why.
-AIMEE-
Okay, but do I have any movement? I guess I do have some movement.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you still have your full movement.
Did you do the stab?
-AIMEE-
I did do the stab.
-AABRIA-
Gross. I love it.
-AIMEE-
I just fucking-- It just feels so good.
And I mean, I think she's just blind with rage, actually.
I don't think it feels good.
I think she's just blind with rage.
And then I guess what I'll do is get back on Fearne and hope, because I can't get to them faster than-- right? Then I can-- How far away--?
-AABRIA-
No, you're pretty far away.
-AIMEE-
Pretty far.
So I can't get to them faster than she can.
So I'll just hop back on her and hope that we can make it.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
As far as possible.
-AABRIA-
Love that.
-MATT-
Filet by Opal.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It just feels so good.
(laughter)
Black and white commercial.
-AABRIA-
She nasty.
-ANJALI-
That perfume actually smells like sandalwood.
-AIMEE-
Yes, it does.
-MATT-
Perfect.
-AIMEE-
Sandalwood with a little blood.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, just a little.
Just notes.
-LIAM-
I like the visual of Opal with her pink outfit and your iridescent hair and just dark blood's going (spurts).
-AIMEE-
Yeah, oh, for sure.
It's like-- Maybe it was a two-hander.
-AABRIA-
Here's the problem, is spray implies pressure.
There is no longer blood pressure.
So what you get instead is as you rip through, you just feel globs of congealing blood, much thicker and more viscous than you'd ever expect.
Just wells up in your hand as you pull through.
-LIAM-
Now you got to do this.
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah, just a--
-LIAM-
Or not.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
I'm more and more concerned with every description.
-AABRIA-
You know what, this is so gross.
I'm sorry, make--
-AIMEE-
Just pulls it out. What?
-AABRIA-
Now I want you to roll to find the ring because you're freaking me out.
I like this.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
I'm picking up everything you're putting out now.
-AIMEE-
She pulls it out. There's all this blood.
-AABRIA-
Give me an investigation check.
-AIMEE-
Oh, 19! Plus? You said investigation?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it's going to be a disadvantage because he's invisible.
Oh, well, I mean, I rolled the 19 plus three.
So that's 22.
Did you roll with disadvantage?
-AIMEE-
No.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
I said that, right?
-AIMEE-
You added that at the end.
-AABRIA-
Okay, assume that stuff--
-AIMEE-
17.
-AABRIA-
-- interacting with the body requires-- Yeah, a 17's still good.
-AIMEE-
It's still good.
-AABRIA-
So you pull through and realizing that there has to be some sort of thing that was making him invisible.
Once you cut the body, you had a really good sense of the anatomy and you're able to trace back up across the torso, down the arms, and I'll let you get that ring.
You pull it free and there is just a corpse of a man with his head just lost.
-AIMEE-
What does he look like and what is he wearing? Can I ask?
-AABRIA-
You don't know what his head looks like because it's inside Fearne's fucking mouth.
-AIMEE-
That's fine.
-AABRIA-
And he's wearing all purple robes.
-AIMEE-
Do I recognize that from the elf encounter?
-AABRIA-
Yes, you do.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
Those bitches.
-AABRIA-
Sweet.
-AIMEE-
Now I got the ring.
And then I jump, I hop back back on her and hope that we'll make it back fast--
-AABRIA-
Vibes.
Dariax!
-MATT-
Oh, right. Okay.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) So Dorian's right in front of me looking--
-ROBBIE-
Fucked.
-MATT-
Fucked, okay.
-AABRIA-
Fine. You're fine.
-MATT-
And I watch one of these living multi-headed statues crumble, but the other one's still standing and ravaging around.
I'm going to be like: All right.
(high-pitched) Okay, I'll get you.
(laughter)
Help me, Ted? (laughter)
-AIMEE-
You're wrong for that.
-MATT-
I'm going to go ahead and use--
-AABRIA-
It's uncanny. It's like a mirror.
-MATT-
Yeah, isn't it?
-ANJALI-
It's so good.
-MATT-
I'm going to use two sorcery points to use Quickened Spell metamagic, to turn his Cure Wounds into a bonus action.
So he's going to cast Cure Wounds at level two to you.
Go out and touch your shoulder and heal you for-- nice.
14 points.
-ANJALI-
Back! Back in the game.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
Oh, poor guy.
-MATT-
Don't mention it.
And then with my action be like: And also fuck this guy! And I'm going to cast Sacred Flame as my action.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
So he has to make a dexterity saving throw.
-AABRIA-
I got a five.
-MATT-
That's a fail and he takes one whole radiant damage.
-ALL-
No! (laughter)
-AIMEE-
Pew, pew, pew.
-MATT-
Wait.
Why not? I'm going to use my third sorcery point, to use Empowered Spell, where I can spend the sorcery point to reroll up to three damage dice.
-AABRIA-
Please, yes.
-AIMEE-
Please kill this--
-MATT-
Eight points of radiant damage.
-ALL-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
That is a much better number.
-AABRIA-
Nice.
Call your shot. Where'd you hit it?
-MATT-
All right, so after healing him, I look over and see it and really focused on it for the first time, I went (screams) and just release the bolt.
I'm going to say, ah--
-AABRIA-
It's got several heads.
-MATT-
Not even going to go for a head.
Is there anything in the genital area?
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
I cannot imagine a enlightened civilized culture that doesn't add--
-ANJALI-
Anatomically correct.
Some situation down at the bottom, yeah.
-MATT-
That situation is now in radiant flame.
And he giggles to himself.
(giggles) Burned its junk.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
All right, back up to the top.
Dorian.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, wow, I feel better.
Thank you.
I think I'm going to avoid a fistfight with the giant flaming cock rock man from now on.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
I am going to keep my distance and I'm going to cast Dissonant Whispers at level one.
-AABRIA-
At?
-ROBBIE-
At the remaining rock guy with the flaming penis.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
And that is a 12 wisdom saving.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Surprising literally no one, it's not very wise, in that it's rocks that move.
(laughter)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do I be mean? This is not technically a creature.
-ROBBIE-
Oh! Oh, good point.
-AABRIA-
This is a construct.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
Nah, I'm going to let you have it.
Go ahead. It can understand a language.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-AABRIA-
Get it.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, eight, 13.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-ROBBIE-
For psychic damage.
And it must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far away as speed allows from me.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Its back is up against the wall of this building.
And what visions did you put in its head? Why is it so scared of you right now?
-ROBBIE-
I think that was the strange part, is that all of the mean and nasty things that I tried to put in his mind, I felt like there was nothing there, but it was like a receiver and it was going somewhere else.
So its reactions weren't-- It didn't feel like a creature.
It felt like it was just an amplifier or something bouncing that reception somewhere else.
So I don't know why it's scared.
Its fear seems to be coming from somewhere else.
-AIMEE-
Interesting.
-AABRIA-
Make an arcana check for me.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just give me a roll with your spell attack.
-ROBBIE-
Like the one I just did?
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Act like you're casting a spell right now.
So what's your spell attack modifier?
-ROBBIE-
I don't have a single non-saving--
-AABRIA-
No, it's okay.
-ROBBIE-
The modifier?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Plus two is the modifier.
-AABRIA-
It's with your proficiency though, also.
So there should be a little number over your spell.
There's save DC.
-LIAM-
Yeah, tap "Magic."
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I only have save, so it's 12.
I don't have any--
-MATT-
The spell attack modifier doesn't include the proficiency bonus, I don't think.
-AABRIA-
Okay. All right.
Go ahead and roll add plus two.
-ROBBIE-
What do I roll? I'm sorry.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
Just give me a d20 roll plus two.
-ROBBIE-
Plus two. Okay.
19 plus two, 21.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, there we go.
We got there anyway, it didn't matter.
-MATT-
Didn't matter.
-AABRIA-
And you push through and you notice this weird feedback.
The fact that it's bouncing off of the inside where a mind would be, but is not.
But Dissonant Whispers has to go somewhere.
It has to reach something, you cause something fear.
And you feel that the source of that fear, you feel it bounce off and away and not reflected back at you, but into the alley beside you at something retreating, and you get a little glimpse of the fear that you caused.
You didn't put new fear there, but you get a reflection back of what she fears.
And you feel that she's panicked that all might be lost if she can't get her hands on the girl.
And now you have a mental bead on the other assailant as she's retreating.
-ROBBIE-
All right.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Anything with your bonus action and movement?
-ROBBIE-
I haven't moved.
-AABRIA-
You haven't.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I feel better.
Do I have to pass by our surviving guy to get to her or to whatever that--
-AABRIA-
No, it's moving back and away from you, so it's not in melee range.
-ROBBIE-
Let the chase continue.
-AIMEE-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to go after, yeah, yeah.
Full movement speed straight at her.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Okay.
-AIMEE-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
You head out into the darkness and take off behind her.
-AIMEE-
Dorian's getting a kiss later from Opal.
(laughing)
-MATT-
Which one?
-AIMEE-
Maybe that Opal!
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Put them in a lineup.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ANJALI-
Six of one, half dozen of the other.
-MATT-
Could be Lucky Pierre if the day goes well.
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra, you're up.
-ANJALI-
Okay. So remaining duder is up against the wall?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, he's backed up, scrunched against it and trying to push back and you actually see the building is splintering and giving away as this thing is trying to push itself back into the civic center.
-ANJALI-
And I see Dorian run down the corridor as well.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you see him turn and he moves off to the side and starts running around the building.
-ANJALI-
I should save the building, but I want to chase the baddie.
-AABRIA-
You know what building this is, right? And you know who's on the roof.
-ANJALI-
Fuck me. Yeah, I'm going after it.
So I am going to-- Fuck, and he's made of stone.
So fire probably doesn't do anything.
-AABRIA-
Are you saying fire doesn't do anything?
-ANJALI-
Yeah, to stone.
-AABRIA-
You absolutely shit-wrecked the other one with the lava whip.
What are you talking about?
-ANJALI-
That was lava-- Lava Whip is bludgeoning damage, remember? We discussed.
-AABRIA-
It's a hot boy, though.
-ANJALI-
All right.
-AABRIA-
Fire works.
-ANJALI-
Let's do it. Great.
Then in that case, I'm going to bust a move up to this dude, hands straight out and blast them with Burning Hands.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
(scoffs)
-ANJALI-
Which is dexterity.
-AABRIA-
Once again, not dexterous.
Does a 10 make it?
-ANJALI-
Nope-rah!
-AABRIA-
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
-ANJALI-
I get to do, because I'm the level I am, a lot more damage than I did before.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, baby.
-ANJALI-
Which is really not that much.
(laughter) That's okay.
It's still 13.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
That's not nothing.
This thing is shattering apart, splitting at the seams.
You can see the fire of your Burning Hands moving into the crevices of it, filling it up.
Porphyry is a stone that looks like you can see other rocks inside it.
So it's already this interesting mix and collage of a thing.
And now there's bits of bright flame within it, too.
It's still up, but barely.
It is hurting.
-ANJALI-
Okay. So that was my action.
-AABRIA-
Uh-huh.
-ANJALI-
Let us see what I can do as a bonus action.
I actually have an unarmed strike as a bonus action.
-AABRIA-
You're going to punch a rock?
-ANJALI-
Huh?
-AABRIA-
You're going to punch a rock?
-ANJALI-
I'm going to fucking grab my staff.
-AABRIA-
That's not unarmed.
-ANJALI-
According to my monkness, using the martial--
-AABRIA-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're good. I forgot.
-ANJALI-
My monkness.
It's not highness, it's monkness.
My holy monkness.
-AABRIA-
Get it.
-ANJALI-
Um.
-AABRIA-
Woo!
-MATT-
♪ You get caught up in the ♪
-ANJALI-
So that's 17 plus four plus six. I'm pretty sure--
-AABRIA-
It's a million to hit. Yes, good.
-ANJALI-
And let's do the d6.
Five.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
This thing is up, but oh god, barely.
-ANJALI-
Now I'm pissed.
Die!
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
And the middle head leans down to your eye level and snaps at you.
And as its mouth opens, it reminds you for half a heartbeat of Mister with that flame burning inside of it.
But you know that fire that you put there is tearing it apart.
It's not fueling it.
These are the death snarls of a construct about to return to oblivion.
-ANJALI-
Can I yell? Can I yell any more at my friends, since I haven't talked to them?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're good, you can talk.
-ANJALI-
I'm going to be like: Follow Dorian.
I have this.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Fearne, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You got guy in your mouth, bleh.
-ASHLEY-
So.
-AIMEE-
And a bloodied Opal.
-AABRIA-
And Opal is a full nightmare on your back.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I feel like, you know, my maw on the face, a corner of my eye just watching Opal.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Knife, blood, yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Trying to see where everything is.
So Opal and I, are we in an alleyway?
-AABRIA-
You've actually appeared, you've popped back out to another side of the street.
You moved through the alley.
-ASHLEY-
That's right.
Because we were with people, so people can see us now.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you know what, alley's pretty clear.
They're like, "Uh-- ♪ Do, do, do, do-do, do-do ♪" Turn around.
Fuck right back off into the fog.
-AIMEE-
You see nothing.
-AABRIA-
No snitch energy in this city.
-AIMEE-
No.
-ANJALI-
Nothing to see here.
-AABRIA-
Not me, couldn't be me.
-ASHLEY-
Maybe hearing Fy'ra?
-AABRIA-
Oh, 100%.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Not even going to make you roll for it.
-ASHLEY-
Do we spot Dorian anywhere?
-AABRIA-
I'm going to say you're going to have to use movement to get back into the plaza.
-ASHLEY-
Humdinger.
Okay.
I-- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Okay, so what I would like to do, I think, in dire wolf mode--
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
I want to, like a proud boy with his new toy that he killed, I want to drag the body.
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-ASHLEY-
Still keep his head, lift him up, and then drag him into the alley, and go towards Fy'ra, because, here's the thing about Wild Shape that I don't quite understand yet.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, for sure.
-ASHLEY-
Intelligence-wise, do you take on whatever creature you--
-AABRIA-
It's really nice, you actually get to pick whatever's higher, so, if you're not very smart, yeah, you can use the better stats between the two.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so, mine is a little bit--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so I'll still--
-LIAM-
I recall that confusion in Campaign Two, because we're all like, "Great, I'm smart," Nope, no, you're not.
You're not a druid.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I remember, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, that's the thing about druid.
-AABRIA-
Polymorph makes you stupes.
Yeah, druids get to retain their intelligence.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Very cool.
-ASHLEY-
I'll take us into the alleyway just to get the body out of the--
-AABRIA-
Very kind of you.
-ASHLEY-
Leave it in the alleyway, and then, how close are we to--
-AABRIA-
What's your dire wolf movement?
-ASHLEY-
50 feet.
-AABRIA-
You can get all the way back through the alley, and halfway through the plaza.
-ASHLEY-
How close are we to Fy'ra?
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra would've had to move to get up in melee range, so I'm going to say you're probably another 40 feet away to get all the way up to her.
-ASHLEY-
In addition to--
-AABRIA-
Oh, hold on, rule of cool is my biggest one, and I don't care about tactical stuff because there's not a fucking map here.
Do you want to be there? Be there, just be there.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, let's be there.
-AIMEE-
Rule of cool.
-ASHLEY-
Let's be there.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Let's be there, let's be there.
-AABRIA-
You pick up speed, and you cross the plaza.
You get right next to Fy'ra, who's standing at the base of this massive beast that's a little bit bigger than you as it's shattering apart and snarling.
What do you want to do?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, finally dropping the head of the guy at Fy'ra's feet, like, "Look what I brought you."
-ROBBIE-
You're galloping full speed through the alleys with a body in your--
-AIMEE-
Fuck yes, baby!
-AABRIA-
See, and that's why rule of cool is important.
-ANJALI-
Rule of cool.
-AABRIA-
Oh god.
-ANJALI-
Come on, we rode a dire wolf, come on.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, man.
-ANJALI-
Let us have our gifts, let us have our toys.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay, and then take a bite attack on the creature.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, get that hot boy with your teefes.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, little teefie bite.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Okay, so pack tactics, if I'm within five feet, I have advantage on an attack roll.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you do.
-ASHLEY-
That's pretty good.
Come on.
Okay, so that would be 16.
-AABRIA-
Oh, yeah, absolutely hits.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, great.
-AABRIA-
It's a big stone thing.
Its armor class is so low.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Those baby teeth dice.
-ASHLEY-
I know, baby teeth.
-AABRIA-
I don't like that you called them that.
-LIAM-
Well, that's what they look like.
-AABRIA-
That makes me uncomfy.
-ASHLEY-
They're made out of human teeth.
-LIAM-
They are this big.
-AABRIA-
Wait, what?!
-ASHLEY-
No.
-AABRIA-
Oh god.
I was going to go home.
-AIMEE-
You were like, "Bye!"
-AABRIA-
We're hanging out late.
I'll leave in the middle.
-ANJALI-
What's this magic thing?
-ASHLEY-
That is 12 points of damage.
-AABRIA-
How do you want to do this?
-AIMEE-
(gasps) Yee!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so drop the head, and then-- or drop the body, rather.
-AABRIA-
Hold on, you get to specify how much.
You were running at full speed with meat.
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
Did you come back with the whole body?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
That was the plan.
-AABRIA-
Hold up, I'm going to make a constitution save for a corpse.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to let you decide.
-AIMEE-
Wait, I need a picture of this.
-MATT-
Few plans survive contact with a meat-flailing corpse in your mouth.
-AABRIA-
I rolled very low for the constitution save of the body, and with the run, I think it just hit, it hit, and then you felt it get 130 pounds lighter, and you-- (spits) and it's just a head.
-ASHLEY-
It's just the head.
-AIMEE-
Yes!
-AABRIA-
It's just the head.
-ASHLEY-
Okay then.
-AIMEE-
Ooh, I love it.
-ASHLEY-
So slinking, shoulder blades out.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Getting up to this creature, and then just taking a running leap, and into the throat, another throat bite at whatever this, you know.
-AIMEE-
She's going to taste.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, tasty.
-AABRIA-
You staying on for this?
-AIMEE-
I think I've hopped off for this.
I've hopped off.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, probably a good call.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Because what you feel as, all of a sudden, all of the muscles under her fur tense up in this predatory moment, and you're like, "This isn't where I parked."
-AIMEE-
It's time to go.
-AABRIA-
Yep, you just--
-ANJALI-
The power of suggestion is so strong, and you're so gory right now that I looked over at you, and the flowers on your dress, I looked at them, and I was like, "She's got blood." (laughter)
She's going for blood.
-ASHLEY-
(poofing) Ah!
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra, you see the shadow come over you
Fy'ra, you see the shadow come over you as this massive dire wolf eclipses you from the bits of that weird gray-gold light as it leaves around you, as you sink down and pounce up on it, your entire body flings onto this thing that's only a little bit bigger than you, but paws wrap around with that human memory of what grabbing, and tackling, and holding is, and you're clawing at it with your back paws, and ripping it apart under your feet.
And as you scrabble up, you're ripping the other heads away, just locked in on the throat of the main head, and then your body suddenly, you feel a snap, your second one for the night, as you drop back down onto the rubble with Fy'ra behind you, so you didn't fall and hit her.
-ASHLEY-
I turn around look at her, and (pants).
-AABRIA-
And you drop this large, burning, molten, nearly-molten rock out of your mouth as you had ripped the throat out of this beast, and it returns back into a pile of gravel.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Heck yeah.
-AIMEE-
You did that.
-ANJALI-
Well done.
-ASHLEY-
(barks) (laughter)
-AIMEE-
Woof!
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
So.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
I feel like that's it.
-AABRIA-
Orym, you're up.
-LIAM-
That thing's dead, I start booking after Dorian.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Who has chased after an invisible person.
I will use my movement to get probably around the corner.
What do I see as far as Dorian?
-AABRIA-
You see Dorian sprinting into the fog, but you don't necessarily-- you see wisps of fog where a person has moved through, but you don't see a person.
-LIAM-
All right, fuck it, I'm just going to streamline this move.
I'm going to use my action to dash, and then get up to pace with Dorian, and run with him after whoever this person is, and that's the end of my turn.
-AABRIA-
Okay, all right.
Opal, what do you do?
-AIMEE-
How far am I from them? If I'm standing next to the dire wolf, how far am I from these two?
-AABRIA-
You have to go out, around the building, around the corner.
-AIMEE-
I'm saying, I guess, the distance, will I make it? Will I catch up to them?
-AABRIA-
What's your movement speed?
-LIAM-
30.
-AABRIA-
And you did a full Dash?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I went 60 feet.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're going to have to use your full movement to catch up, and that'll be your--
-AIMEE-
Not even halfway there?
-AABRIA-
No, if you sprint, and if you use your movement and the dash action, you can catch up to them.
-AIMEE-
How about this? What if I-- Okay, so here's what I want to do.
I'm going to grab the fucking head, because I'm so angry.
So I'm going to grab it by the hair--
-AABRIA-
You have to walk up to go grab the head.
-AIMEE-
Sure. I'm going to grab the head, and then I'm going to use my full movement, and then Misty Step again, and that's 60 feet, right?
-AABRIA-
I'm going to say you're going to have to use your movement to get-- Because you're going to-- What you're proposing--
-AIMEE-
I thought I was next to the head.
-AABRIA-
Well, what you're proposing is a blind Misty Step into an alley you haven't seen.
-AIMEE-
Oh, okay, okay.
Okay, so then, what I'll do then is that-- I'll use the dash action.
-AABRIA-
No, no, no, I'm just saying, use your movement to get eyes down the alleyway, and then you can Misty Step to catch up.
Does that makes sense?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, but if I hold my Misty Step, can I do a cantrip as a bonus action? If I do the dash?
-AABRIA-
If you hold, you're holding everything.
-AIMEE-
No, no, sorry.
So let's say that I don't do the Misty Step, and I use my full movement plus a dash, could I still use a cantrip as my bonus action?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, only if the cantrip is a bonus action spell.
-AIMEE-
Let me check.
-ROBBIE-
Are we in chase rules now again?
-AABRIA-
I was going to resolve something at the end of this round.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
So the answer is not quite yet, but maybe.
-AIMEE-
Oh, fuck, well, Misty Step is a bonus action.
Here's what I want to do, and you'll tell me if it's possible.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-AIMEE-
Okay? I'm going to tell you what I want to do.
I'm going to pull one-- I want to pull a Fy'ra Rai.
-AABRIA-
I mean, you got to do it.
-AIMEE-
Here's what I want to do.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
I want to get close enough to this invisible creature where I could cast Druidcraft on it, so that maybe there's something that will make out its shape, like maybe a small cloud with rain, or, you know, something that we can make out what its shape is.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, the bending you're doing.
-AIMEE-
That's what I would like to do.
-AABRIA-
The juice you are extracting.
-AIMEE-
That's what I would like to do!
-AABRIA-
Hilarious.
Now, rule as written, this is not an offensive cantrip.
It does little dumb shit.
-AIMEE-
No, that's fine, yeah.
-AABRIA-
However, if you are going to spend the entirety of your turn to try to get in and line up a shot of Druidcraft that doesn't do damage on someone you can't see.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
I will allow you to make that attempt.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I'm going to make the attempt.
-AABRIA-
I love stuff.
-AIMEE-
I'm going to make the attempt, and I have the head in my hand.
-AABRIA-
You've grabbed the head.
-AIMEE-
I want this person to see me with this fucking head in my hand.
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Vibes.
So you run.
-ASHLEY-
Witness me!
-AABRIA-
Run.
-MATT-
Straight up.
-AABRIA-
So movement, dash, you're now--
-AIMEE-
Yeah, movement, dash.
-AABRIA-
-- caught with Orym and Dorian.
-AIMEE-
Yep.
-AABRIA-
And now, you're going to try to line up a-- What do you want it to look like if you can cast something that will outline?
-AIMEE-
Would outline? I mean, what's something that could outline? Because the fog's not really doing it, right?
-AABRIA-
I mean, the fog, you're just seeing like (whoosh).
Good, that's a fucking description.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
You're seeing fog move.
As a person moves through it, but it's not really giving you a clear outline.
-AIMEE-
Would rain do it? Or would-- I can't think of another weather event that could do that.
-AABRIA-
Uh-huh.
-AIMEE-
A sandstorm?
-AABRIA-
It's a cantrip!
-AIMEE-
Okay, fine.
Just a small cloud.
Small cloud, but it's rain.
-AABRIA-
You can make a little flower or something, like a little mushroom just, boop, up on her head.
-AIMEE-
Oh, well, let's do that.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, that's a stupid thing.
I'll allow that.
-AIMEE-
Oh, all right, let's do that.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, yes!
-AIMEE-
A flower.
Sorry, this is taking so fucking long.
-AABRIA-
No, you do not apologize!
-ASHLEY-
Do not, do not.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
This takes as long as it needs to take.
-AIMEE-
You know what? I want it to look like a dart, even though it doesn't cause damage, I want it to look like one of their fucking darts.
-AABRIA-
I like that. A little enoki mushroom dart.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
Hey!
-AABRIA-
All right, I need you to make a spell attack roll with disadvantage.
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
Aw, two.
-ASHLEY-
(groans) Aw, dang it.
-ANJALI-
It would have been beautiful.
-MATT-
It was a worthy endeavor.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good try.
-AIMEE-
I mean, come on, cool-- What is it? Cool's rules?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ALL-
Cool's rules.
-AABRIA-
It's like the shitty reboot of Blue's Clues, yeah.
-ANJALI-
Got cool's rules.
-AIMEE-
Cool's rules!
-AABRIA-
So you attempt to throw-- You know what? Cool's rules.
-AIMEE-
And she's so mad, you know, it helps.
-AABRIA-
She's so mad, and I don't care about a stupid mushroom.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
So yeah, do you yell anything to get her attention?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I go: Hey! in, like, the most intimidating voice I could muster.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I guess that'll do.
She's not going to turn for "Hey." Do better.
-AIMEE-
Oh, how about this? Oh, I mean, if I really want to insult someone--
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-AIMEE-
I use the C word, but I won't do that on this family show.
-AABRIA-
See you next Thursday, let's go.
-AIMEE-
I'll be like: Hey, see you next Thursday, but I've actually said the whole thing, the real thing.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
Perfect.
-AIMEE-
But I say it in Elvish, because I speak Elvish.
-AABRIA-
There you go.
-AIMEE-
Bye.
-ALL-
Yeah!
-AABRIA-
And with that, yeah.
You see that little, stupid enoki mushroom in her right shoulder.
You see it turn.
-AIMEE-
It sounds better in Elvish.
And I'm just dripping with blood, and then there's also blood coming off the thing, and I'm like (growls).
What do you want?
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
That's it.
-AABRIA-
All right, I liked that a lot.
-ANJALI-
Yay!
-AABRIA-
Dariax!
-ROBBIE-
That was a lot.
-AABRIA-
Cool, it's weird.
What do you want to do, Other Opal?
-AIMEE-
Other Opal watches original Opal run by, covered in blood, holding a severed head.
(laughs) And takes a moment to process.
-ASHLEY-
I love the (panting) "What?"
-MATT-
Yeah.
As I'm trying to catch up, following after Dorian runs off, and, I mean, you know, following his lead, and, you know, Orym just darts by, too, on his little dwarvish legs, trying to keep up.
Opal rushes by.
He's like: Uh! Other not-real Opal went crazy! (laughter)
Just tries to catch up around the corner to see what's even happening.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you see Orym, Dorian, and a Kill Bill nightmare holding a severed head shouting into the darkness, and because she's turned around, you can see just the very tip of a little purple enoki mushroom.
That's it.
-MATT-
I would say that my passive perception, I probably don't even see the mushroom.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, that's fair.
I was going to give that to you, but--
-MATT-
No, I appreciate that. With the mist?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Nah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, they are just shouting and staring into darkness.
-MATT-
Not that there's anything I can do about it.
I go: (pants) Everyone okay? Glance around and look at the three of them, see how they're all looking.
-AABRIA-
Do you use your dash to catch all the way up to them? Or are you farther back in the alley?
-MATT-
No, I'd be further back.
Mm, I'll use my dash to catch up to them.
That's my whole turn.
-ROBBIE-
Group chase.
-MATT-
Yep.
-ROBBIE-
Group chase.
-MATT-
(pants)
-AABRIA-
You're right, a group chase would begin.
However, I held off on this last person's action to go at the very, very end.
And you hear a voice, loud, and if you speak Elvish, you understand it.
If you don't, she says, "I will take away everything you hold dear.
You don't deserve it." And then she casts Dimension Door and disappears.
-AIMEE-
Aw, man.
-LIAM-
Counterspell!
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
Woo!
-LIAM-
Oh, shit.
-AABRIA-
You pull out a piece of thread.
-LIAM-
Wrong guy.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Wrap it around your fingers.
-LIAM-
I just kick the ground.
-ROBBIE-
Our quarry did that?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Ah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mostly because it's, like, I don't know, 2:00 in the morning, and you guys can go home.
I'm not going to let you fight her.
Not yet.
-AIMEE-
I want to fight her.
-ANJALI-
Come on, I don't have anywhere to be until 8:00am, come on.
-AABRIA-
Oh, we've got time, then.
-ANJALI-
We have time.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) But yes, you are out of initiative, and you're standing, staring down this street.
You feel this pressure, and you can hear the vacuum as air rushes to fill a space where a person, though you couldn't see them, once was.
-LIAM-
Wow.
Great.
What the hell was that about?
-MATT-
Are they all gone?
-LIAM-
I think so.
What? What are you hold-- Oh.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
I think she's like, you know when you're shaking, and all of the adrenaline is coursing through your body, and I don't think she understands what just happened.
-LIAM-
Opal, Opal. Opal?
-AIMEE-
Yeah?
-LIAM-
Bring the head, come on, let's find the others.
-AIMEE-
What head?
-LIAM-
Come on. And I put my hand up, she's higher than me, so on her forearm, and guide her shellshocked self along down the alley.
-AIMEE-
And then I go: What head, Nancy?
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Oh my god.
-LIAM-
I just push her forearm higher, and raise the head up--
-AABRIA-
I'm going to make a wisdom save on that.
-LIAM-
-- into her field of vision.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
Ugh! (gasps)
-LIAM-
Let's go figure this out.
-AIMEE-
Drop the head.
-LIAM-
Oh, okay.
-AIMEE-
Oh, then you grab it.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
And you carry the head back into this plaza that's now beginning to fill with people that have responded to the clashes, and bangs, and people that were still in the civic center late into the night are now fleeing around the sides, and gathering, and looking at these massive piles of rubble where two large, beautiful statues once stood.
-ANJALI-
Is the building-- The building's structural integrity, it's not-- I know it was--
-AABRIA-
It's not amazing, but there's no threat of imminent collapse.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Once it broke down, the pressure subsided.
-MATT-
I'm going to go ahead and drop the disguise of Opal, but walk up to Opal.
-AABRIA-
I liked two Opals.
And seeing her through all this, put my hand on her shoulder, like: You okay? You okay, Opal?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
-MATT-
Yeah, let me get you some water.
-AABRIA-
Opal, something within you, as the adrenaline begins to leave, you feel Ted finally relax and slump down.
For the sake of now until we discuss it next, you no longer have access to your magic, as Ted has been put to sleep.
-AIMEE-
Gotcha.
Does she realize that, or she just feels the relaxation?
-AABRIA-
You can feel it.
Especially now that you've lived through a world in which you felt her holding that back from you intentionally.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, for sure.
-AABRIA-
You can feel the negative space, the lack of it.
You feel so ordinary now.
And you're alone, finally.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
And it's on that note, in that quiet, lonely moment, that we're going to wrap for tonight.
-AIMEE-
(squeals)
-AABRIA-
You did it, you survived.
I was trying to steal you, and you resisted.
I'm very proud of you.
-AIMEE-
Thanks, guys.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-ANJALI-
Whew.
Because we have a very fast, bloodthirsty dire wolf on our side.
-AIMEE-
Yes, woo! Fearne for the win, baby.
-MATT-
Do I have a blanket and some hot cocoa I can put around her?
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Like she'd run in that marathon. (shudders)
-AABRIA-
It's the little deer.
-AIMEE-
Yep.
-MATT-
Man.
What do we want to do? Time is funny, and we're telling the story, so things can exist out of order, if we need them to, and I don't want to take this away from you, or elide it to a note that you leave to the group that I read in a poor imitation of your excellent voice.
So when did you leave the group?
-ANJALI-
So after I make sure that everyone is calm and okay, I feel, somehow, in me, another pull.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
Another pull in this space.
Now I can feel her, and I feel the throbbing in my arm, and it is clearer than ever that, no matter how much I want to stay with you all, I have to go.
I have to go to her, because she needs me more than you do, because you have proven yourselves so incredibly worthy.
So we say a quick goodbye, but I know that it's urgent.
And, as I am leaving, I go to leave, and I look up, and I turn to Dorian, and I walk directly up to your face, and I take your head in my hands, and I pull it so that your forehead is to mine.
I know you know, little brother.
I know you remember.
You made a choice once.
You thought you were unrecognized, unloved.
<i>Something</i> drove you to a terrible choice, and you were willing to risk anything because you thought it was better to be alone.
I am here to tell you, it is never better to be alone.
Stay with your family.
Not all family is blood.
Much family is chosen.
I cannot protect you again.
Only you can do it this time.
Stay in the light.
Yes?
-AABRIA-
You can have this conversation.
I'm not stopping this, keep going.
-AIMEE-
Mm.
-ROBBIE-
Thank you, and don't worry.
I would do anything for my friends.
-ANJALI-
I believe you.
Keep them safe.
Especially that very confused, but gifted dwarf.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
I did not expect the Observer to speak to him, but now, I know there is something extremely special about him.
-ROBBIE-
I hope you find your sister.
-ANJALI-
I know I will.
And if you all need me more than I am needed somewhere else, I suspect The Gift will bring me to you again.
But I will not hope that you are in that much danger, ever.
I think you should call yourselves the Chosen Ones, because I choose you in my heart.
Goodbye.
And she turns around, and stalks off.
-AABRIA-
Make a wisdom saving throw for me.
-ANJALI-
16 plus two, 18.
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra, you were brought so far into their orbit the first time, and then back again, and you've led them for weeks, and across countless miles, through danger and discomfort, to get back here.
And though you feel the pull, that thrill of duty, and dread, and excitement, and fear, and wonder at the truth that your sister is alive and out there, you know in your heart that this isn't the end.
You were brought to them.
They were chosen, but so were you, and this isn't the end of your time with them.
And you know, more than anything else, with the wisdom that is dawning on you, that gives you a sense of perspective, almost like you're looking down from the skies, that this next part, they must do alone.
And then, when the time is right again, you'll return, come back together for some great and terrible purpose, and in that knowledge, you slink back through the fog, and are quickly lost to darkness, out of Niirdal-Poc, through the jungles, and towards her, your sister, alive and waiting.
And that's where we'll end for tonight.
-MATT-
(chuckles)
-AIMEE-
Woo!
-AABRIA-
Thank you so much for joining us.
-ANJALI-
Thank you so much.
(cheering)
-AABRIA-
Yay.
-ANJALI-
You guy are amazing.
-AABRIA-
You're amazing!
-ANJALI-
You flipped a crocodile on its back.
You beheaded people with dire wolf teeth.
You played two different beautiful women.
(laughter)
Come on.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Too much.
-AABRIA-
Oh man.
You're phenomenal, and I don't have words to say how much of a pleasure it's been to get to run a game for you, and tell a story with you.
I'm not going to cry, because I'm a bad bitch.
-ANJALI-
I'm already crying, it's fine.
-AABRIA-
No, it's fine, it's fine.
-ASHLEY-
Bad bitches can cry!
-AABRIA-
I'm just-- What?
-ASHLEY-
Bad bitches can cry.
-AABRIA-
Okay, well, I just got some splatter from that guy in my eye.
I'm fine.
-AIMEE-
Head juice.
-MATT-
No.
-AABRIA-
Head juice.
-ASHLEY-
Head juice.
-ANJALI-
Now I'm going to cry because that sounds so gross.
-AABRIA-
It's so gross.
Okay, all right, well, that's it for tonight, and, until we meet again, stay safe, be good, and is it Thursday yet?
-ASHLEY-
See you next Thursday! (laughter, cheering)
-AABRIA-
A liminal darkness.
A place between places where she has been alone for so long, waiting for that little bit of glimmering light that is her sister.
And yet she hears the echo's footfalls, impossibly loud, And yet she hears the echo's footfalls, impossibly loud, slow, methodical, approach her and swirling into her field of vision, a woman wreathed with purple energy, smiling, grinning, bearing her teeth at her.
"I've been looking for you for so long.
And I'm so close, and I will burn the world apart to have you." And Ted screams.

Critical Role Campaign 2 Episode 12 "Midnight Espionage"
-MATT-
Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
(cheering)
Before we get into tonight's story, welcome.
We have some quick announcements to do. First off, we have two fantastic sponsors for the evening.
Returning for the second week for the newly released game, Far Cry 5.
(cheering)
-TRAVIS-
So good.
-MATT-
It's out for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The latest installment of Far Cry, if you guys aren't familiar with it, is set in the fictional Hope County, Montana, where a fanatical doomsday cult known as the Project at Eden's Gate has taken control. If you are playing it or plan to play it, you'll probably hear me and Marisha somewhere in that cult, I'm sure, or scattered in the game at some point.
-TRAVIS-
You're cultists?
-LAURA-
I've always known that about you.
-MARISHA-
It's my true destiny, yeah.
-MATT-
I got to work on my Montana for that one. It was fun. It strangely is. Sorry, Montana. Grab your sidekick, train your dog, and fight against Eden's Gate in the most Far Cry way possible, which is with extreme force, so pick up a copy today. Hope you enjoy.
-TRAVIS-
The prologue is so good it is currently encompassing Brian Wayne Foster's life.
-MATT-
This game is a lot of people's lives. I've watched people vanish over the past couple days.
-LIAM-
Raving about it. It's only been out for five seconds, and everyone's gaga.
-MATT-
Yeah. Jess Black in the game is voiced by our friend of the show Julie Nathanson. She is amazing and you should enjoy her work in there as well. That's our first sponsor for the night. Our second sponsor and our continuous sponsor for this new campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.
(cheering)
-SAM-
Here to talk to you about D&amp;D Beyond is a returning friend of the show.
(laughter)
-MATT-
No! No, why?
-SAM-
Bonzai, wave hogs and hog-ettes, it's Brody Slater, king of the kick-flip, jamming about the froobs at D&amp;D Beyond. You all know I love letting my leash out on maxed shore breaks at Steamer Lane. Real bang! When I'm not flashing the shaka at some quimby on a softboard, I'm chillaxing with my buds with some gnarly roleplaying games. Now, I'm partial to Dead Earth, Empire of Satanis, and F.A.T.A.L.-- slotted!-- but my broheims are hooked on fifth edition, which means I get stoked for D&amp;D Beyond. If there's one thing Brody Slater loves more than shacked eskimo rolls, it's diligent organization. Right now, you can go to D&amp;D Beyond's Facebook page and leave a comment on their top (stammers) pinned post, telling them your favorite moment for episode 11 of Critical Role to be entered to win a legendary bundle. Far out! So don't be a Benny Poser, head on over to D&amp;D Beyond and enter now. Hang 11! (cheering and clapping)
-LAURA-
Wait, leave it on, because you kind of look like Estelle Getty.
(laughter)
-MATT-
If Shakäste comes back later on, you can play his spiritual weapon.
-LIAM-
That made me uncomfortable so fast.
-MATT-
The character didn't click until he said he played F.A.T.A.L., and then I was, oh, I know who this is now.
-SAM-
I don't even know what that is, I looked it up.
-MATT-
Don't. It's awful. It's the worst.
-TRAVIS-
Is that the third time we've had him? In our lifetime?
-SAM-
Fan favorite. And by fan, I mean me.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Thank you, Sam.
-SAM-
I'm a fan of my own character.
-TRAVIS-
Like Halley's Comet, you always come around.
-MATT-
Thank you, Sam, and thank you to D&amp;D Beyond for being awesome supporters of the show. A couple quick things after that. First off, reminding you guys about Twitch Prime. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you can connect it to your Twitch account, and every month you can subscribe for free to a channel of your choice. Whether that'd be us or anybody else you'd want to show some love to, costs you nothing and it's pretty awesome, so do it if you haven't. If you need a recap for campaign two, we're doing our Critical Recap episodes now with our fantastic Dani Carr, who is doing succinct updates and reminders for things that have happened in the campaign, or if you've missed something and don't have the time and want to watch live, you can watch Critical Recap and be right ready to go when you’re here on Thursday.
-LAURA-
Right ready to go.
-TALIESIN-
Right ready.
-MATT-
Talks Machina, of course, is every Tuesday evening. We just had our WonderCon panel that we did this past Sunday on Tuesday night for Talks, and it's online. You can go watch it on Youtube now. Again, Geek and Sundry Youtube, should be up there to watch it. But the episode of Talks for tonight's episode will be next Tuesday at 7pm Pacific with our fantastic host Brian W. Foster.
Please come join those of us who will be here, and enjoy.
-LAURA-
My mom called me today, and she's like, “I'm watching you in the WonderCon panel.” I was like, oh no. What did I say? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I think your language was actually pretty good.
-LAURA-
Was it?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
We kind of had to. Yeah, on the back of the name cards, it says, “Please don't ever say bad words."
-TRAVIS-
We still dropped a few.
-MATT-
Yeah. I mean, we're only human.
-MARISHA-
We do our best.
-MATT-
True. Most of us. Except for Taliesin.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-MATT-
The podcast of last week's episode, episode 11, is available for download, so if you listen to the show audibly or have friends who do, they can download it now, where finest podcasts can be downloaded. C2E2 is coming up! Not this weekend, but the weekend after, in Chicago. We're all going to be there. We have panels, signings, all of the information is up on the website now. You can find it on the Geek and Sundry Twitter or the Critical Role Twitter if you're wondering what is happening and where to go. We'd love to see you. Please come and be a part of the crazy convention. It's probably going to be pretty crazy.
-SAM-
Is it?
-MATT-
It's pretty big and there’s a lot of people going.
-TRAVIS-
Chicago is a tiny town, though. There's not really a lot that's there. It's a couple trains or little puddle-jumper flights to get there.
-LIAM-
Are you pre-rolling your goddamn dice now?
-TRAVIS-
It was one roll!
-LAURA-
It's true love, baby.
-MARISHA-
There was definitely more than one. It was at least two or three.
-MATT-
We're watching you like a hawk now, man.
-TRAVIS-
Never again.
-MATT-
Also, our fantastic friends at 826 and 826LA; they're a great charity. They do wonderful stuff for children in creative writing. Please go ahead and check out what they do, see if you can help support it or actually be a volunteer if a chapter is near you, so check it out. We love them and you should do so too. I don't think we have any new merch per se other than just the reminder, you have that wonderful shirt.
-LAURA-
Oh, this shirt?!
-MATT-
It looks good on you even when you're preggers.
-LAURA-
Thank you.
-SAM-
Even better.
-LAURA-
This is our first maternity shirt.
-MATT-
Officially. Unless we have anything else to say, I believe that gets us caught up and ready to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.
[click, TV static] [groovy Critical Role theme]
Hello and welcome back. Last we left off, the Mighty Nein had gotten in bed with a rebel group who had been meeting in the interior of Zadash. Unhappy with some members of the local government of this city, they had been trying to discover a way they could discredit some of the corrupt individuals that have been causing some strife in this city to some of the locals. You had met some of these individuals a few times to discover that there is an End of Harvest Gala that was arriving fairly soon. That was going to be a distraction period to allow them to infiltrate the abodes of two individuals in particular: Lord Sutan and the High-Richter Prucine. You discussed with them last time a plot, fixing their not-very-well-put-together plot into a better direction, thankfully.
-TRAVIS-
We're all fucked.
-MATT-
--to acquire a wax seal within the home of Lord Sutan to create a letter that you feel would be incriminating, then to infiltrate the High-Richter's home, do the same, and then report them to the lawmaster, or whoever else you'd think would be of higher estate. This is transpiring tomorrow evening. Where we last left off, it was later in the afternoon after your final discussion. You guys have a day to prepare however you wish to.
-SAM-
A whole day?
-LAURA-
Well, half a day, and then a whole other day.
-MATT-
Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?
-TRAVIS-
What's the lawmaster's name?
-MATT-
Orentha.
-MARISHA-
Dayana Prucine
-MATT-
That's the High-Richter.
-MARISHA-
Oh, Orentha.
-LAURA-
Where are we right now?
-MATT-
Right now, you guys have just finished meeting with the other members of the Knights of Requital in--
-TRAVIS-
At the Song and Supper Inn
-MATT-
Song and Supper, yes.
-TALIESIN-
Previously known as the Knights of Requital.
-EVERYBODY-
Right, yes.
-MATT-
No longer.
-TRAVIS-
We’ve got to figure out where fucking Lord Sutan is, right? We don't have any eyes on that location.
-MARISHA-
I think it might also be smart to see if we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for possibly both the Lord Sutan and the High-Richter, so we can more convincingly forge documents.
-TALIESIN-
We have Book Boy, too, he could probably tell if they're the same or not with his--
-MARISHA-
With his brain.
-TALIESIN-
With his brain.
-MARISHA-
With his head.
-TALIESIN-
Yes. Well, the eyes in it, yes.
-LAURA-
Wait, what did you say? I wasn't listening.
-SAM-
(groans)
-LAURA-
There was a spiderweb in the corner of the room and it's really pretty.
-MARISHA-
You're good at forging, right?
-LAURA-
Yes, I am! Why do you ask?
-MARISHA-
We have to get some handwriting samples, right? Of the Lord and the High-Richter, that way we can write letters, make it seem like they're--
-LAURA-
Yes, I’m very good at writing letters.
-TRAVIS-
Where would we find something that's handwritten?
-SAM-
Maybe on the job board at that place.
-TRAVIS-
Would that come from them, you think?
-SAM-
I don't know!
-LIAM-
They might have some sort of edict written by Prucine.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we didn't really check to see if they had signed any of them, did they?
-TALIESIN-
We had them, would we have noticed if they were hand-signed or if they’d been printed?
-MATT-
At the job postings you had seen on the task board outside of the King's Hall, they were handwritten, but they all had been written by the Herald of the Hall. He was the one who was handling most of the jobs that were being distributed. Whatever information comes to him, he's the one who posts them, it seems.
-LAURA-
Well, I guess we we’ll just have to find a letter within their house, and then I can forge it right away.
-SAM-
On the spot? How fast a forger are you?
-LAURA-
I'm a really quick thinker and I'm also a pretty fast writer.
-SAM-
Here, let's test you. I'm going to write down, (stammering) "Oh, what a goose I am." Copy my handwriting.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
(laughing)
-SAM-
It's pretty good.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I was going to make you roll for it, but no, you got this.
-MARISHA-
Nott, I think we’re going to need you to both break in the house and also maybe into some safe that they have in there.
-SAM-
Me?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you're good at lockpicking.
-SAM-
Okay. Will I be in there alone?
-MARISHA-
No, we’ll be with you.
-LIAM-
We will decide who goes in. I also want to discuss what exactly we are going to forge before we go in, because the plan that they laid out for us was not good.
-MARISHA-
You can say it.
-LIAM-
<i>Scheisse</i> is a word for it, but they talked about making it look like Sutan had broken into Prucine's home and rolled it. I don't know what effect that would have on her, so I think maybe we hatch some sort of conspiracy between the two of them to assassinate Orentha, so we will go to Sutan's house and we will leave--
-SAM-
I’m drinking.
-MARISHA-
Nott, what was the last thing Caleb said?
-SAM-
I always listen to Caleb, he's my right-hand man.
-MARISHA-
What did he say?
-SAM-
Poutine.
-MARISHA-
That’s not what he said, but that is delicious and now I want some.
-LIAM-
Follow me please, for a moment. We have to do our homework first, but after we do homework, we go to Sutan's, we find this seal, we hold onto it. We leave fake communication that you will write that is from the High-Richter, calling for a hit.
-LAURA-
But how will we leave something from the High-Richter if I don't know actually what her handwriting looks like yet?
-TRAVIS-
I was thinking, do they have post here in this city? Someone that comes and picks up mail? Could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail?
-LIAM-
You have stolen mail.
-MARISHA-
I have.
-LIAM-
You can do it again.
-SAM-
You're proficient in mail fraud.
-MARISHA-
I am definitely proficient in mail fraud.
-TRAVIS-
What time is it?
-MATT-
It's later afternoon.
-TRAVIS-
What's the exact time? No, I'm just kidding.
-MATT-
Don't pull a Liam.
-MARISHA-
There would be a public record somewhere, right?
-LAURA-
A public record of her handwriting?
-SAM-
Well, if she’s issued any sort of royal, official things, yeah, there should be some sort of record.
-LAURA-
She is a judge after all, right?
-MARISHA-
And generally those public records tend to need to be open for--
-TALIESIN-
These are the most intense public officials I've ever attempted to swindle, so I'm not entirely sure what we do at this level.
-MARISHA-
Well, I will say, worst case scenario, we don't necessarily need to match her handwriting, but some type of coding, potentially linked back to her. We can almost mimic it. People who are doing sneaky things never use their real handwriting.
-TALIESIN-
Leave a mark on a tree, etcetera. if you agree to these terms, and then we leave a mark on a tree, similar sort of thing.
-MARISHA-
Sure. Maybe some accounts of the Myriad.
-TALIESIN-
A bag of gold in a trash receptacle.
-TRAVIS-
What the fuck are you talking about?
-SAM-
We're leaving a bag of gold in a trash receptacle?
-TALIESIN-
I'm saying that there's nothing to commit proof other than money actually exchanging hands. We used money for these things all the time back in my day. So if that letter asks for some sort of assurance or some sort of money to be placed: "Please hire a couple people, you can leave some money in this location for them," and if they find that money, then they know they actually consented and agreed to this whole argument.
-LAURA-
This is very complicated.
-SAM-
Extremely.
-TALIESIN-
It isn't that complicated.
-TRAVIS-
What if we divide our forces for now and try to find that handwriting sample? One of us goes and looks for the post, the other one tries to find those public records.
-LAURA-
What if I go find the High-Richter and ask for her autograph?
-SAM-
Like you'd be a fan?
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-TALIESIN-
I don't know if Richters have fans.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, she was kind of unpleasant.
-LAURA-
Really?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, she wasn't really about that fan life.
-LIAM-
Did not care about your buttons.
-LAURA-
That’s right. She was vain.
-LIAM-
The goal to be that we leave something in Sutan's house that would make it seem that the High-Richter has ordered a hit on Orentha and we leave something behind in Sutan's house: fake communications with the Myriad. So we tie Sutan to the Myriad, we tie Sutan to Richter, and then at Richter's house, we leave forged documents, we have a letter from Sutan with the seal, and also we leave communication with the Knights, whatsit--
-MARISHA-
--of Requital. Where I thought you were going, Molly, which isn't a bad idea to leave some sort of money trail, is leave a certain amount of money with any type of paperwork that might also be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house.
So paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich people, right? So they always have these safes filled with documents.
-LAURA-
Oh yes, we had one of those at our house.
-MARISHA-
Were you guys paranoid?
-LAURA-
Well, no, we just had a lot of secrets.
(silence)
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'm baffled by the notion of building a box inside of a larger box inside of a larger box to hold papers, but fine.
-SAM-
Step one is: find documents. This is the most exciting thing we’ve ever done.
-MARISHA-
We also need to find where Lord Sutan lives.
-SAM-
Oh! So find addresses <i>and</i> documents!
-MARISHA-
Correct.
-SAM-
Ooh! Cue the music.
-LAURA-
I bet that the people in the Knights-- previously Knights-- they would know where Lord Sutan lives.
-MARISHA-
They might even have some sort of documentation or record. Remember Dolan was saying that they got ousted from their practice because of this Lord Sutan. Maybe they already have a paper trail.
-LAURA-
Don't we know where Dolan lives?
-MARISHA-
We do. Nott tracked them.
-SAM-
I do. I saw their home? He lived--
-LAURA-
Oh, yes. Harold? Horris.
-LIAM-
Also, they will put out of businesses, if possible, they have some sort of paperwork that would come from the desk of the High-Richter.
-TRAVIS-
Possibly, but if we go by there, we can't be seen.
-LAURA-
We can't be seen. We'd have to be in disguise, or one of us.
-TRAVIS-
Or knock on the back door, if such a thing exists.
-TALIESIN-
Let's start by talking to our friends before we start investigating our allies.
-LAURA-
Yes. Let's go that way.
-MARISHA-
Do we have any--
-LAURA-
Go get him, monk.
-MARISHA-
That's going to be really cool when I can do that. Really cool. Catch a fly. Anyway, moving on, that was me.
-LAURA-
Should we go to Dolan's house?
-SAM-
All of us?
-TRAVIS-
Is that how we want to find Lord Sutan's address?
-LAURA-
Maybe the Richter's handwriting, too.
-MARISHA-
I wonder if we can track down Ulog.
-TRAVIS-
That seems like a good idea.
-SAM-
One thing at a time.
-LIAM-
That's another thing-- and we can table this-- but there is also the possibility that this is all just a honey trap, and that we’re being drawn in for as big a fish than the Knights are themselves.
-MARISHA-
You think we're big fish?
-LIAM-
Well, I think that they think they are looking for potentially big fish. I'm not saying that we are big fish. But we might be walking into a trap, so eyes on a swivel, is all I’m saying.
-TRAVIS-
So you're saying Ulog probably is in trouble and is going to roll over on us in order to get something taken off of him.
-LIAM-
Potentially, or any of them. Ulog seems the shiftiest, but that doesn't mean that he would necessarily be--
-LAURA-
Ulog’s probably listening to us right now.
-TRAVIS-
To Dolan's, then.
-SAM-
All of us? All right, let's go.
-MATT-
All right. You guys make your way, following Nott, who had previously trailed Dolan to the home, and you eventually find your way to the outskirts of a very simple-- it’s a hovel, but only because it's been in disuse for a while.
There is a single front door, it looks to be a two-chamber home, with one large central main living space and one bedroom in the back. The roof itself is made of heavily pressed-together thatch and stick. As soon as you approach, you can see that the front door is closed, and you see a little bit of movement through the window, someone walking around.
-SAM-
Who wants to go knocky-knocky?
-LAURA-
We shouldn't be seen with them.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you said there's no back door, right? Side windows, anything like that?
-SAM-
No, I just saw a window and a door. Right?
-MATT-
From what you saw, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Well, it should be one of the three of us, because that's who they'll know.
-LIAM-
You two have been speaking to them the longest.
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Go do it, Fjord.
-LIAM-
You are a good talker, Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-SAM-
In disguise or as is?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'm going to fucking change it up.
Is there a little alley that I can pop into before I head over to his place of residence?
-MATT-
Yeah, two buildings over, you look off to the side and there's a small alcove of shade where you could probably pop in quickly and dispense a spell without it causing any ruckus.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I cast Disguise Self and I turn back into that-- black cloak with gold trim, the long black hair--
-MATT-
The same figure you brought to the High-Richter's?
-TRAVIS-
That's right.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
I tie my robe.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
It's all I've got.
-MATT-
Doesn't take a spell slot.
-LAURA-
You're not going up there with him, right? Because he's in disguise now. You look the same, Beau.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, if you look like you--
-MARISHA-
No, I got that. Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
We don't want to have them see us going over there.
-MARISHA-
Okay, well then you go.
-TRAVIS-
Cool. All right.
-MARISHA-
Feel free to give me like a--
-TRAVIS-
Oh, what's the sign?
-LAURA-
(screeching bird call)
-LIAM-
No, that's not it.
-TRAVIS-
A peacock?
-LAURA-
I thought that was a hawk.
-SAM-
(pigeon cooing)
-TRAVIS-
Was that supposed to be a hawk? A pigeon? (pigeon cooing)
-SAM-
(pigeon cooing)
-TRAVIS-
Fair enough, it's a pigeon. A feral pigeon.
-MARISHA-
I'll listen for the pigeon.
-LIAM-
A peacock is a fancy pet.
-SAM-
What are we signaling for?
-TRAVIS-
If there's trouble.
-TRAVIS-
All right.
-MARISHA-
There's a signal, we have one.
-TRAVIS-
I walk over to Dolan's house.
-MATT-
All right. Knock on the door?
-LIAM-
What happens if a pigeon goes by? (laughter)
-SAM-
A flock of pigeons come down.
-LIAM-
(spell noises)
-MATT-
All right. As you knock on the door, there's a pause, and you see out of the corner of the window, the edge of a face peek out there, and then disappear behind, and a voice goes, "Who is it?"
-TRAVIS-
Yes, it is-- I bring word from the Mighty Nein. May I come in, please?
-MATT-
You hear some rustling, some unlocking process, and the door opens up and you can see Horris opens the door and Dolan's behind. "Yes, please, come in." Looks just past you as you enter the building and they close the door behind you.
-TRAVIS-
Is there anyone in the room that I don't see besides Horris and Dolan?
-MATT-
It's just the two of them at the moment.
-MARISHA-
Do I see-- sorry.
-TRAVIS-
I'll drop the disguise.
-MATT-
Okay. They both pause for a second. "Oh, wow, all right, you are as skilled as they say, it seems. That's pretty useful."
-TRAVIS-
I apologize. We realize that after you-- (drawl) I apologize.
(laughter)
After we finished speaking, we realized we weren't aware of where Lord Sutan resided.
-MATT-
"Oh, right. His abode-- he lives in the Gilded Willows in the Tri-Spires."
-MARISHA-
Knew that much.
-MATT-
"He's, I would say, not too terribly far from the Skyscape Park and where the Constellation Bridge tower stands. It's a three-story house, dark wood, gold leaf carving. It's a bit gaudy, hard to miss amongst some of the other ones there, although all of them are gaudy in their own right.
Look for the three-story, iron-gated, dark greenwood building in that vicinity."
-TRAVIS-
Great. Will do. Another thing that we realized-- in our efforts to frame and forge, which are vast, you don't happen to have any handwriting from Lord Sutan, do you?
-MATT-
"Unfortunately, no, most lords are very careful with documentation transfer back and forth, they usually go through direct parcel services."
-TRAVIS-
There was nothing that ousted you from your business, any sort of receipt, or--
-MATT-
"Oh, no. (chuckles) Nothing that was directly from his hand, at least. They usually go through intermediaries for that purpose."
-TRAVIS-
Is there anyone else in the area that we should know that he does business with, that he might communicate with regularly?
-MATT-
"I mean, that would be the one that replaced us--" And he nudges over to Horris on the side.
"That would be--" I had that written down.
Somewhere in here. Oh, shit, it's my older notes.
-TRAVIS-
There's a pen pal. And finding out who the pen pal is--
-MATT-
Exactly.
-SAM-
(pigeon cooing)
-MARISHA-
This is really good all to know. Now we're getting all this information.
-TRAVIS-
No, there's no fucking pigeons.
-LAURA-
(as pigeon) High-Richter's handwriting!
-MATT-
"I believe it's Ren Sutan."
-TRAVIS-
Ren Sutan.
-MATT-
"Yes." If not, the Internet will correct me.
-SAM-
Ren Sutan is his name?
-TRAVIS-
That's who he wrote to, though.
-LAURA-
Oh, I thought Sutan was a title, like Lord Lord Lord.
-MATT-
"Oh, no, Lord Diedric Sutan is his name, Ren--"
-TRAVIS-
It's who he wrote to.
-MATT-
"Ren is his son who he placed to destroy and take over our practice."
-TRAVIS-
Well, he sounds like a real son of a bitch.
-MATT-
You hear Horris, off to the side, arms crossed now, hearing all this, goes, "Yeah, you could say that."
-TRAVIS-
This Ren Sutan, any idea where we might be able to find him?
-MATT-
They both look at each other, and you watch as Dolan glances out the window. "Not that far outside of the Apple Tree Tutorship vicinity, you will find a white and peach building, with a few banners in the front, and that's Ren's new practice."
-TRAVIS-
A physician also.
-MATT-
"Yes."
-TRAVIS-
A dark physician, most likely, hmm?
-MATT-
"I mean, sure." He looks confused.
(laughter)
"Dark physicianry I guess is an issue in some parts of the world, I suppose?"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, rampant where I'm from. Just real fucking dark.
-MATT-
He looks back at Horris. Horris is like, "Right. Well, if you come across any dark physicianry, please do your best to quell it where it... seeds." (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Indeed I will. Indeed.
-MATT-
"Thank you."
-TRAVIS-
You probably will not be hearing from us again before the task is done.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-LAURA-
(as pigeon) We need it more! High-Richter! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I keep trying to make a sound, it's just nothing's working.
-TRAVIS-
Was I supposed to say stuff about the High-Richter?
-MARISHA-
I don't know, I'd say take the foot-in-mouth signal.
-LAURA-
We need the handwriting of the High-Richter more than Lord Sutan's handwriting.
-MATT-
You're not there.
-LAURA-
(exasperated sound) (laughter)
-SAM-
We blew it.
-LAURA-
Fuck! (as pigeon) High-Richter!
-SAM-
(as pigeon) High-Richter!
-TRAVIS-
Thank you. We won't trouble you any longer.
-MATT-
"No worries. I suppose since-- Tomorrow evening, when everything's set to go, me and Horris, Kara, we're not going to be present when all of this goes down, so we have deniability when we turn our information in for this whole endeavor, but I think Ulog and you guys should meet on the outside of the tavern that we met at earlier today to kick this off."
-TRAVIS-
Song and Supper Inn.
-MATT-
"You got it."
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
"Well good luck, and--"
-MARISHA-
(drawl) Mustard. Biscuits.
-LIAM-
(drawl) You're just a little feller, you oughtn’t talk like that.
-TRAVIS-
Lock that door behind me, and I leave.
-MATT-
All right. Locks the door.
-SAM-
How did it go?
-LAURA-
Did you get the handwriting?
-TRAVIS-
Stupid pigeons.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but I'm not sharing it. Yep. Got it.
Got it, no problem. Read it, looked at it, I understand what it looks like. Let's go.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Fjord, we need it. Really bad.
-TRAVIS-
Nope, sorry, not going to help you.
-LAURA-
Did you not get it?
-MARISHA-
What did they say, though?
-TRAVIS-
A whole bunch of stuff, but I can't say it around them, I just won’t, out of principle.
-MARISHA-
Okay. All right. Yep.
-LIAM-
Yeah, but actually do you think you could go back and say that you forgot to ask a question?
-LAURA-
Just say, hey, the whole point of this was to find the High-Richter's handwriting as well, and maybe--
-LIAM-
I understand that these two are really busting your balls, and I commiserate with that, but we do need in fact to ask.
-TRAVIS-
Now, see, if you ask nicely, yeah, things will ha-- I walk back up to the door.
(laughter)
Knock-knock-knock.
-MATT-
The eye peeks through the window once again.
-TRAVIS-
One more thing.
-MATT-
(door opening)
-MARISHA-
I'm keeping an eye out for anyone watching.
-TRAVIS-
Totally forgot to ask, you don't happen to have any handwriting from the High-Richter do you?
-MATT-
"No, that would make this a lot easier."
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I know.
(laughter)
Great.
-MATT-
"Sorry."
-TRAVIS-
Have a good day.
-MATT-
"You too." (door closing)
-TRAVIS-
No. None.
-LIAM-
Okay, well, we checked that box off, so now we have to get to work.
-SAM-
We got some good information, we got Sutan's address and Ren's address.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. Blah blah blah, Ren's address and the address. Now you got it.
-SAM-
Oh my god!
-MARISHA-
Oh, and it's super interesting--
-LAURA-
Whoa, that is really good, Fjord, you did a really good job in there.
-MARISHA-
Also super interesting that they mentioned having other people do their work for them. (pause) Okay, let's go!
-TRAVIS-
Was that mentioned?
-MARISHA-
He said they have other people do parcel service and stuff for him.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, okay, yeah, that. Blah.
-MARISHA-
See?
-SAM-
So you're saying that we could use other handwriting as well, and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary, as long as it beared the signature and seal of said place?
-MARISHA-
Well maybe not even a signature. Most people trying to be smart about not getting caught aren't probably like my name and social security number.
-LAURA-
What if we get some parchment that says from the home office of Lord Sutan?
-SAM-
Ooh, a letterhead.
-MARISHA-
You want stationery, sure.
-TALIESIN-
Beyond actual, personal stationery. I think the notion would be is that you would actually send your actual handwriting in something like this because that way they would know that it was you. You would be very careful how and who you would send that through. You wouldn't want a second person taking dictation as you plotted to overthrow the government.
-MARISHA-
Okay well how about this, I think the seal is going to be good; I think any type of money amount mentioned in any of the letters and then we cross that and leave that type of amount of gold in the-- like there's been a money hand off.
-TRAVIS-
We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's stay on task. Let's head to the Gilded Willows where in the Tri-Spire, where the fucking Scottsdale party-- What do these notes say, Skyskate Park and Constellation Boulevard.
-LIAM-
Knotts Berry Farm.
-SAM-
Constellation Bridge.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah that thing.
-SAM-
Constellation Bridge.
-MATT-
Constellation Bridge tower and Skyscape Park.
-MARISHA-
In between Adventureland and Frontierland.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I was writing real fast.
-TALIESIN-
It's good there's a bathroom on the way to that. That works out well.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
So we're going there with the express purpose of--?
-TRAVIS-
Just recon. We're trying to see what this place looks like, if we can see Lord Sutan. Then we'll make a decision if we go after his son or not. Who maybe has some of his handwriting.
-SAM-
That's in the Tri-Spire. So we need to go through the sewers to get there.
-TALIESIN-
Maybe a birthday card.
-LAURA-
Or we can go up, a few of us, through the actual front gates and then meet up with everyone.
-MARISHA-
Okay, well how about half of us go to Lord Sutan's and half of us go check out Ren's.
-TRAVIS-
Sure.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
What are we looking for at Ren's?
-TRAVIS-
Handwriting.
-SAM-
Okay, from his papa.
-TRAVIS-
And see if Ren's a son of a bitch. Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
I'll go to check out Ren.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah me too, because I can't make it through the gates.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-SAM-
I don't think anyone can make it through the gates, except for you.
-TRAVIS-
That's what I was wondering what you were talking about.
-TALIESIN-
I thought we were going to take the sewer to get in there.
-LAURA-
I thought Beau might be able to get through the gates, actually.
-MARISHA-
I could get through the gate.
-LAURA-
Huh?
-TRAVIS-
Because she's got a cloak now.
-LAURA-
Yeah and it's not a magical disguise.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Cool.
-MARISHA-
I'll go check out-- yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Caleb, where you want to go buddy?
-LIAM-
I will go to Sutan's.
-TRAVIS-
Wait, they're both Sutan.
-LIAM-
No, the elder, I'm sorry.
-SAM-
Will you be able to get in?
-LIAM-
Not without you. You'll come with me?
-SAM-
We'll sneak on in through the sewers?
-LIAM-
Well how do you want to do it?
-SAM-
They're talking about going straight in through the gate because they're, you know, respectable.
-LAURA-
(distraught) Well it's such a thing to get into the sewers. We have to make a distraction and everything, every time.
-TALIESIN-
Perhaps we should just have a two person reconnaissance for now.
-LAURA-
Right.
-MARISHA-
We can manage ourselves.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
We're good.
-LAURA-
Yes, we won't get into any trouble.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you won't bring back Clarota or nothing, it'll be great.
-LAURA-
We know our way around.
-TALIESIN-
Too soon.
-TRAVIS-
Can't be.
-MARISHA-
We got this, let's go.
-TRAVIS-
Should we meet back at the Song &amp; Supper Inn at what, sunset?
-MARISHA-
What time is it?
-LAURA-
Or just at the Leaky Tap.
-MATT-
You got maybe an hour and half to two hours before sunset.
-LAURA-
Let's just meet back at the Leaky Tap.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, fair enough.
-SAM-
At the Leaky--
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
The Leaky or the Song &amp; Supper? We're talking about two different-- Leaky Tap.
-TRAVIS-
Leaky Tap.
-MARISHA-
Hour and a half, all right.
-LAURA-
Let's go.
-MARISHA-
Break.
-LAURA-
Woo!
-MATT-
You both make your way toward the Tri-Spire.
As you make your way towards the front entry gates there, one of the guards posted there is familiar with you and begins to let you through. As you approach--
-MARISHA-
I flip it to the blue side, cobalt.
-MATT-
As you pass through, a few steps behind Jester, the guard approaches, “Halt. I don't believe I've seen you through here before."
-MARISHA-
Oh I'm--
-LAURA-
She came through earlier. She's with me.
-MARISHA-
Literally like 24 hours ago.
-MATT-
"Very well."
-MARISHA-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Steps back. You guys make your way, following the directions to the Gilded Willows.
You see the massive tree-tops that fill out the skyline from your perspective. Every home seems to have a row of greenery between. It's a very, very beautiful neighborhood. You can follow where the Constellation Bridge Tower as a beacon and as it guides you towards its area it doesn't take long for you to see the large, gaudy, three-story complex that is Lord Sutan's home. You can see the gold leaf carving along the edges of each of the various stories in between. The dark green slats that are there, are coated in some sort of a lacquer material that almost glistens in the sunlight as it passes. The sunset colors now starting to make their way into the cloud-covered sky. You do see marble pillars at the corner of the estate's grounds. With iron gates that link each of them, with about maybe five foot bit of simple lawn-hill that separates the gap between the gate and the building itself.
-MARISHA-
Are the gates chained shut or does it look like there's a lever?
-MATT-
Well the gates on all them are solid except for in the very front and the very back. Both of them appear to be closed and locked. You do see, posted at the front of the front door, there are two crownsguard that are there keeping watch. On the back end as you case around to the rear side of the home, there is a singular crownsguard and a dog that is on a chain.
-MARISHA-
Two in front. Does it look like there's any blind spots, any trees that go up and cusp over the walls?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
Hashtag NBC Blindspot.
-MARISHA-
Not good. Eleven.
-MATT-
It's hard to see where any perspective would be a blind spot. For entry, other than above or from the sides because the front and back seem pretty well covered by these guards, as they're currently posted and standing there. So the only things that really make sense would be either flanking the building or something that guides you over top. That's all you can think of.
-LAURA-
How high are the buildings next to the house?
-MATT-
The one that is immediately to the left of it is two-story, it's a shorter building. There is a tree to the immediate right of it that rises up to about the height, if not a little taller, than the actual home itself. The building next to it is another two stories. This one lords over the other buildings, but there is one large tree that is about five feet from the edge of the wall.
-LAURA-
Okay. That seems usable.
-MARISHA-
It's a big jump but we can do it. It's not too big.
-LAURA-
Like a five feet jump?
-MARISHA-
That's doable, yeah.
-LAURA-
From, like a swinging branch?
-MARISHA-
From rooftop to wall.
-MATT-
It's five feet to the wall, and then about five feet from the wall to the actual building. So it's a ten foot from the tree to the roof.
-TALIESIN-
Could you parkour the wall?
-MATT-
You could certainly try.
-MARISHA-
That was what I was thinking, wall to wall.
-SAM-
Monk shit.
-TALIESIN-
I knew you were already there.
-MARISHA-
Do they look like one of the--
-MATT-
The gate's about eight feet tall and the building is three stories. So I mean there are some roof-edge perches the stories kinda taper with each additional floor. So there is a small space, maybe a foot, a foot and a half wide that you could shoot for. If there was something you wanted to try but--
-LAURA-
Are there windows on that side of the house?
-MATT-
There are no windows on the base floor, or at least none that you can see. The second floor you do see one set of double windows that open.
Though they are currently closed. Those are on the two side edges of the building.
-LAURA-
Is there a balcony connected to them?
-MATT-
No. There's no balcony.
-MARISHA-
No balcony. So there appear to be--
-MATT-
The only balcony you saw was in the large balcony at the front of the High-Richter's home, but not on this one.
-MARISHA-
No balcony, okay.
-LAURA-
So a few guards.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-LAURA-
A dog.
-MARISHA-
A dog, I like dogs.
-LAURA-
I love dogs.
-MATT-
As you glance at the back of the building, the doors that you see immediately, there is one set of doors that is the front with the two guards are. The back where the other gate entrance is, there isn't another door that leads into the home.
There is a double-cellar door that descends beneath. That is what is currently being guarded with a man and the dog.
-LAURA-
Okay. I wonder if anything would lure the guards away from the house.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, maybe a drunk. A drunkard trying to break in somewhere else?
-LAURA-
Maybe.
-MARISHA-
You know, a public disturbance.
-LAURA-
Maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the front of the house or something.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Or in the back.
-MARISHA-
I mean our group is pretty good at causing distractions.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
They can do that. That's totally-
-LAURA-
Some people jump up and over?
-MARISHA-
Yeah. It's going to have to go fast.
-LAURA-
Yeah. Oh man. Maybe we could get some rope and a grapple.
-MARISHA-
Yeah we could do that.
-LAURA-
We could throw a grapple for ten feet, I know that.
-MARISHA-
Do I have a climber's kit?
-MATT-
Do you have a climber's kit?
-MARISHA-
I don't have a climber's kit, but we can go buy a climber's kit.
-LAURA-
We can go get a climber's kit.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I just got a shit-load of ball bearings.
-TALIESIN-
I got ball bearings, man.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Guys, let's challenge ourselves. We have to break in, only using ball bearings.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MARISHA-
How do we do it?
-MATT-
The new D&amp;D nightmare mode.
-LIAM-
(shiftily) You need some some ball bearings man?
-MATT-
You're all level one bards with nothing but ball bearings, go.
-TALIESIN-
Call me pinball wizard.
-LAURA-
We did a good job scouting this place out and stuff.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Do there seem to be any weak points, any loose bricks in the walls?
-MATT-
Unfortunately--
-MARISHA-
As we walk by, I'm playing with the wall, but I'm testing for weak spots.
-MATT-
Well the wall is an iron gate. They're all long, iron fencing gate. There are the marble pillars at the corner of each one. So it's open, it's a series of bars.
-LAURA-
Are they pointy-top iron bars?
-MATT-
They are. They are poodle impalers.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah that changes things, the landscape.
-MARISHA-
I understand now.
-TRAVIS-
You can see if it hurts your hand if you touch it.
-LAURA-
I bet it does.
-MARISHA-
Oh there's no--
-LAURA-
Can you stick your fingers through the bar?
-MATT-
Do you want to try it?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
You die.
-MATT-
Okay as you place your hand through the bar--
-TRAVIS-
No fucking way.
-MATT-
Nothing happens.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Ah, you son of a bitch.
-MATT-
No, it's fine.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
(vaporized noise)
-LAURA-
Disintegrate.
-MATT-
Game over.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, new character.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
You know, when I used to hop fences back where I came from--
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm?
-SAM-
Where was that?
-MATT-
You're not there.
-SAM-
Oh I'm not there.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
If you're ever trying to get over barbed-wire or any pointy fences, you take a rug or a bedroll, and you throw it over there, and you hop over and you--
-LAURA-
That's personal Marisha experience isn't it?
-MARISHA-
Yeah I mean--
-TRAVIS-
That's some Fight Club shit.
-MARISHA-
I'm just throwing that out there. It works.
-TALIESIN-
A plank of wood will work too.
-LAURA-
I feel like that would be a really good idea. I feel like it might be a little noticeable to carry around a rug.
-MARISHA-
A bedroll is not too bad.
-LAURA-
Most people in the Tri-Spire don't carry around bedrolls.
-LIAM-
(coo) Haversack (coo).
-LAURA-
Yes but it's little.
-MATT-
Shh.
-LAURA-
You're not there.
-SAM-
It's not him, it's a pigeon.
-MATT-
That's true, you're right Sam.
-SAM-
There's a metagaming pigeon in this.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(coo) Remember (coo).
-MATT-
(coo) Bonus action (coo).
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(coo) Hunter's Mark.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Can we please make the metagaming pigeon a thing now? I've played with a few in my time.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Turn Undead (coo).
-MATT-
All right. Anything else you guys want to do while you're there?
-LAURA-
I think-- are we good?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
-MATT-
Okay. Do you guys want and try for a climber's kit on your way back?
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-MATT-
Okay. It takes a little bit of time to find a place because some of the shops are starting to close past sunset. The time it took you guys to get there, do a full casing and come back the sun has set and the sky is getting darker. However, thankfully a climber's kit is not all that expensive. With a full cost on that-- come on.
Climber's kit-- ha, I was wrong, 25 gold.
-MARISHA-
(groans)
-LAURA-
What if we don't want the whole kit, just the grapple part of it and the rope?
-MATT-
Just the grappling hook?
-TALIESIN-
We have rope.
-MATT-
Two gold.
-LAURA-
And the rope?
-MARISHA-
We're just trying out the gym. We're not fully committed to it yet.
-MATT-
(laughs) Right, can I get a consultation first?
-LAURA-
What is fully included in the climber's kit?
-MATT-
(funny voice) Ah, climber's kit includes a lot of things.
(normal voice) Includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. That's for mountain climbing.
-LIAM-
CrossFit T-shirt.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I have pitons, and a hammer, and rope.
-MATT-
Some nice core balls you can sit on. Yeah, so you want a grappling hook and rope? You can get those. Those are cheaper.
-LAURA-
Yes that would probably be a good idea.
-MATT-
Grappling hook is two gold and the rope-- you want silk or hempen?
-LAURA-
(whispering) The cheaper one.
-MATT-
That would be hempen, so that's one gold.
-SAM-
You're probably more familiar with silk bindings.
-MATT-
So three gold for a single grappling rope and rope.
-LAURA-
That I use for different things.
-SAM-
Got it.
-LAURA-
I don't use them at all.
-MATT-
So mark down that you have a grappling hook and 50 feet of hempen rope.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right. As you guys are accomplishing that, the rest of you--
-LAURA-
I'll get rid of-- I'll pay for it.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-MATT-
The rest of you, what are you doing?
-LIAM-
I don't think we want the group to be too big. Let these two handle this Ren and you and I will wait at the Leaky Tap and lay low.
-SAM-
You want to let them go off on their own?
-LIAM-
We don't want to create-- why do we want a group--
-TRAVIS-
You've never heard of safety in numbers and all that shit?
-SAM-
They have to break in somewhere, they're going to be--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah man. I just figured you'd be a part of this.
-SAM-
I mean, I'm with you Caleb. If you don't want to go then let's go back to the Leaky Tap.
-LIAM-
No, we're going to break into houses together. Of course I'm willing to do this. I just feel like for this-- what are you planning to do?
-TRAVIS-
Just some simple reconnaissance. See if we can see Ren, maybe have a conversation with him.
If he's not a total prick, I don't know, maybe he's got some of his dad's handwriting.
-LIAM-
Yeah, okay.
-SAM-
We don't have to go, I don't care.
-LIAM-
No it's fine.
-SAM-
It sounds scary to me.
-LIAM-
No I-- my head is not in the game. We'll go along.
-TRAVIS-
Great, we're going to head towards the Apple Tree Tuneship? What did I write here?
-MATT-
(laughs) The Tutoring Village.
-TRAVIS-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-TRAVIS-
Oh god. Nine, twelve.
-MATT-
Twelve, okay. It takes you a little while to get there. You haven't actually been to the Tutor Village before.
-TRAVIS-
13.
-MATT-
Okay, same difference. So you manage, through asking questions and finding your way around, you manage to get to the Tutor Village right around sunset. You do see, about one block over, the large, white-peach building that you had previously been told by Dolan. You see the sign up; it's called the Guided Hand Infirmary. It's one story, but it stretches wide towards the back.
It's like a large shotgun building.
-TRAVIS-
Guided Hand Infirmary?
-MATT-
The Guided Hand Infirmary. You can see light from the interior. There are two windows at the front, and a row of windows as it continues down the back of the alley. The alley, you can see, actually lights up, because the bright interior warm light reflecting off of the buildings on the opposite side, down the alley on each parallel end of it. The building itself seems fairly well made, there's elements of a plaster material put against the wood to make it seem a little less cracked and broken on the vicinity around it. It looks like a little more money went into this complex than a lot of the surrounding buildings.
-TRAVIS-
Right. He's a physician. Well, before we put a personal touch on it, do you people with sneaky abilities want to see what you can see in the windows?
-LIAM-
Yeah, well, we could send Frumpkin to have a look around.
-SAM-
That's a good idea.
-LIAM-
I send Frumpkin. He will run around the entire building, if he's able. He's also able to climb things, so I will get him up on top of window sills, if he can, to take a look inside.
-MATT-
As Frumpkin curls up and jumps onto the windowsill, and you glance through the vision of your familiar. The first window you come across, inside, it's a simple room, it’s painted a similar white, peach color. There's a single bed, maybe twin size, with a single sheet. You see an individual who is currently lying on it, with not quite Caleb dirty clothes, but not an upperclassman by any means. Upperclassman? Not what I was going for, that's fine.
-TRAVIS-
Seniors '99! (laughter)
-MATT-
Wooo! Sydney football rules. Weird. But, you do see this individual is currently has a full arm bandaged, with blood soaked and dried on parts of it, and they are currently asleep, and the door is closed. There is a lantern inside that is set to keep the room warm.
-LIAM-
Is there the ability for Frumpkin to move around to the exact opposite side of this building?
-MATT-
Yeah, have him move around, go around the front.
-LIAM-
Yeah, he will jump up to any windowsill on the back of the house as well.
-MATT-
As Frumpkin keeps watch on each of these, each chamber seems to either be empty or there's somebody in some state of either rest, or waiting.
You see one person, a younger girl maybe fifteen or sixteen years old, who is waiting on the edge of a bed, sitting quietly in a room by herself.
Glancing around, she looks over and sees Frumpkin, and goes, "Kitty!" and makes the hand motion to try and pet-- You go around the back door and you can see one room has two beds that currently have two individuals that are coughing heavily. They're sick with something pretty bad, and there is a person inside that is dressed in a white robe that is in the process of bringing them both broth, but they have a mask over their face, a piece of cloth tied behind, and it looks like they're treating some diseased patients. This is, for all intents and purposes, an infirmary.
-LIAM-
Yeah, did you say this was a one story building?
-MATT-
It's a one story building, but it's quite long. It goes back quite a bit. Other buildings are spotty and build the space around the outside of this block, whereas this infirmary stretches the entire length of the block.
-LIAM-
Five to ten minutes of hopping from ground to window a bunch of times, all I find are patient rooms. No sort of office or anything else?
-MATT-
Correct, it looks like all-- It looks like it's built so that all the rooms that have sunlight are the rooms where the patients would stay. Anything important would be kept in the interior of the building.
-LIAM-
One last thing, how high is the roof?
-MATT-
The roof is about, I'd say, 12 feet up.
-LIAM-
Fjord, come here. Scooch down for a second, and I jump up onto-- I've taken my vision back-- I jump up onto his back. Now, stand up!
-TRAVIS-
11 strength. Okay… Oof!
-LIAM-
Okay. I snap at Frumpkin, and he vanishes, and I reach out, and Frumpkin appears. I am now within ten feet, I would assume, of the top of the building, so Frumpkin is on the roof.
(teleportation noise) I want to send him to look-- Then I hop down off of Ford and put my hand and steady myself on Fjord and have Frumpkin look for any holes in the roof, or if there's a skylight, or anything. Probably not, but it's worth a try.
-MATT-
As you're focusing, Fjord, you notice a small child, maybe five or six years old, this scruffy reddish hair and a dirty smashed face, walks up and goes, "What happened to the kitty?"
-TRAVIS-
Oh, you know, it ran up on the roof. We were trying to chase her down. You want to see if maybe she ran around the corner?
-MATT-
"I was going up to pet it, and it went away!"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. They're tricksy like that.
-MARISHA-
Second time your cat just vanished.
-TRAVIS-
Tell you what, if I see it, I'll call out.
What's your name?
-MATT-
"Oh, I'm Simon."
-TRAVIS-
Simon, okay.
-MARISHA-
Simon!
-SAM-
We found him.
-LAURA-
Simon became a real boy.
-MATT-
He's a real boy.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Simon, I'll call out if I see him. Why don't you see, if you run the other way, see if you can find him.
-MATT-
"Okay." He runs around the other side of the building. Frumpkin is on top. And, looking at the top, the front of it looks really nice. The top, which nobody sees, doesn't look that great. It's a pretty shoddy, wooden slats over wooden slats, across the entirety of the roof complex. You can see one small trap door, about the center of it, that is currently closed.
-LIAM-
Okay, I call him back.
-MATT-
(Meowing)
-LIAM-
Then I (snaps fingers). And then he's on my shoulder.
-MATT-
At which point, you hear a kid go, "Whoa!" Simon is now on the side, staring at this disappearing and reappearing cat.
-LIAM-
Yeah, cats are the best. I don't know, there's a trap door up there, but, I mean, we're not going in.
-SAM-
Go. Go away! Go. Go away! Shoo! Go away!
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Oh my god.
-SAM-
14.
-MATT-
14. (screaming) and he runs.
-SAM-
Oh, sorry.
-LIAM-
Well done there, yeah. What do we want to do? This place is full of sick people.
-TRAVIS-
Right. Unless Ren is actually on the inside. If they had an office, maybe we could rifle through some--
-LIAM-
Yeah. And if we're going in, what do we do? We could have one of us be ill perhaps.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. Or just ill on the front doorstep and keep them occupied.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. I could, you know, kick the shit out of Nott in the face, and then be like (yelling).
-SAM-
I mean, we've got Mollymauk with us. Why don't you just do the same thing to him?
-TRAVIS-
I could kick the shit out of Nott in the face, and then like--
-SAM-
I don't appreciate this. At all. I feel like I'm being singled out because I'm a woman.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
A better idea, perhaps, is for one of-- You're able to disguise yourself, right?
-TALIESIN-
To a point.
-LIAM-
There's three of us, that we can all disguise ourselves. I can make myself look like like a sick person.
-TRAVIS-
Although, he's a physician. So he might try to, you know, check. And I think, up to touch, it falls apart.
-LIAM-
Well, you can make yourself look like you, but with not green skin.
-TALIESIN-
It's standard carny practice to be able to fake boils and stuff with a disguise kit to leper up a bit?
-MATT-
It would take you about an hour or so to do so. To a studied physician, probably not going to hold up.
-TALIESIN-
Sure.
-MATT-
You can certainly try. Depending upon how high you roll.
-TALIESIN-
Could fake some sick on people.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I mean, I could mimic whatever you have, and try to stay at arm's length.
-TALIESIN-
You can just drag me in.
-TRAVIS-
I like it. Yep.
-TALIESIN-
I can make a scene.
-TRAVIS-
Yep. I like that. Then you two try to get into the office somehow?
-SAM-
If there is an office.
-TRAVIS-
I'm assuming there is. It's a doctor's office, right?
-LIAM-
There is some sort of trapdoor in the center of that building that I don't think is mirrored by any of the rooms that I was able to see on the outside of the building. So it's like a donut with a hole in the middle, is where, maybe, what you're looking for.
-TRAVIS-
I think that makes sense. We'll cause a ruckus, see what you can find.
-LIAM-
Yeah. Ruckus, you and I go in.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Have we talked about the other house yet? Because the distraction was obvious.
-TRAVIS-
Is it?
-TRAVIS-
Well, they're not here.
-TALIESIN-
Was it a guard dog?
They haven't gotten back yet. Nevermind, all right, I'm jumping ahead.
-TRAVIS-
It was a Chihuahua on a chain.
-TALIESIN-
We’re in!
-TRAVIS-
Fierce as shit. Spiked collar, tongue out--
-TALIESIN-
We're going to need a bigger boat.
-MARISHA-
Its name was Princess.
-CALEB-
We're going to walk right in. These two are going to create such a fuss.
-TRAVIS-
How long do you need to make your face all lepered up?
-TALIESIN-
About an hour?
-MATT-
About an hour.
-TALIESIN-
And who said I was going to do my face?
-LIAM-
Couldn't you maybe act like--
-TALIESIN-
We don't want them to look at it too closely.
-SAM-
Look like you're just-- Cough and stuff?
-LIAM-
Could you be a sick tiefling?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I'm going to do that, too. I've got a plan.
-MATT-
You’re going to spend time and apply.
-SAM-
Oh, I've got it, I've got it. Faster. What if Caleb burns all of your clothing and you go in as a burn victim?
-TALIESIN-
You're not going to touch my clothing.
-CALEB-
That's not, we’re not doing that.
-TALIESIN-
No, we're not setting fire to my clothing. I'm going to mess up my junk what fierce.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
Gross.
-MATT-
In the street?
-TALIESIN-
No, back at the-- do we have a place where I can work, or am I going back to the Leaky Tap? Or is that too far away?
-MATT-
That's up to you, you can try and duck into a shady corner. And spend an hour.
-LAURA-
Spend an hour painting your dick?
-TALIESIN-
An hour painting my dick? No, I'm going to need some privacy for that.
(laughter)
I'm also going to need to order some breakfast food. Something eggy.
-LAURA-
Ugh.
-TRAVIS-
For fuck's sake, Jesus. Really?
-TALIESIN-
Really.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. All right.
-TALIESIN-
I thought you wanted a distraction!
-TRAVIS-
I do! I'm all about this. Let's go find breakfast. Jesus.
-LIAM-
When we go in, we don't walk in just you and me. We do Mother's Love.
-SAM-
Yes. Yes. We do Mother's Love.
-LIAM-
Just in case.
-SAM-
Yes, good idea.
-TRAVIS-
Can we find a tavern?
-TALIESIN-
A Denny's, whatever. The worst pub ever.
-MATT-
You can get yourself some evening scrambled eggs for five copper.
-TRAVIS-
I think we need sunny-side up, don't we?
-TALIESIN-
No, I'm going to scramble everything.
I'm going to get some beer. I'm going to get some mayo. I'm going to get a little bit of everything, I'm going to put it in my--
-LAURA-
In your butt.
-MATT-
All right. If you're gathering all those materials from a scattered meal--
-TALIESIN-
A little bit of hot sauce.
-MATT-
We'll put it at about eight copper for the total.
-TRAVIS-
I'll pay for it. Don't. It's on me.
-TALIESIN-
No problem. We're going to put it in my-- I've got a little water sack. I'm going to mix it all up and put it in there and wait till we're ready to go.
-MATT-
Okay. I'm going to say for this, go ahead and roll a d20. Add your proficiency bonus and intelligence modifier.
-MARISHA-
Come on, stage makeup class!
-TALIESIN-
D20, proficiency bonus, intelligence modifier?
-MATT-
Yeah. Because this is about trying to come up with an accurate means of looking like you've been infected with something.
-TALIESIN-
That's 11.
-MATT-
11. Okay. You take an hour and you're pretty proud of it. You think it'll work fine.
-SAM-
Did you add your intelligence bonus?
-TALIESIN-
I have no intelligence bonus.
-SAM-
Oh, great.
-TRAVIS-
Do I dare ask what it looks like?
-TALIESIN-
You can see.
-LIAM-
Yeah, show us the goods. What did you do to yourself? Oh!
-TRAVIS-
Why would you even?
-TALIESIN-
That's the brilliance, is no one's going to look that closely.
-TRAVIS-
That's in your brain forever.
-TALIESIN-
Literally forever.
-MATT-
For a month.
-MARISHA-
This is going to be the weirdest fanart.
-TALIESIN-
Shit! I didn't even think about that! God damn it.
-LIAM-
I will have Jester sketch it out and we will have it forever.
-TRAVIS-
Are we ready to do this? Are you ready to make a damn fool of yourself?
-TALIESIN-
I'm always ready to make a damn fool of myself.
-TRAVIS-
All right. Let's go. We go up to the front door. Where are y’all going?
-LIAM-
We're going to hang back. Is there a nook or an alley within view of this?
-MATT-
There's alleys on each side, but they both have windows that are lit, so you would be in one of those vicinities.
-LIAM-
Can we go half a block away?
-MATT-
You could. You would be at a distance though.
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's fine for the moment. For the moment, yeah. Get ready, we're going to do Mother's Love.
-SAM-
How will we know when to go?
-LIAM-
We're going to watch them at the door.
-MATT-
All right. So the two of you enter. You go through the front door. It's a double door. It pushes open. It doesn't appear to have resistance, it's on a hinge. You push in, and at the front there's a clerk there, wearing the same white robe: a middle-aged man, receding hairline, short hair, big bulbous red nose, some pock-marking on his cheek. He looks up. "Can I help you?"
-TALIESIN-
No, I'm fine. I'm perfectly, perfectly fine. I don't need to do any of this.
-TRAVIS-
(coughing) No, you need help. It's real gross.
-TALIESIN-
I'm fine!
-MATT-
He reaches down and pulls a cloth up and puts it immediately over his face. "Okay, um-- "
-TALIESIN-
No, I don't -- I was born in a place like this. I don't want anything to -- I'm going to give myself a little (grunt). Sir, there's -- (vomit). I'm going to go for it right in his face.
-LIAM-
The ruckus is audible all the way down the block, so I turn myself into a half-orc woman and pick up Nott like my baby and put her head on my shoulder and start walking towards the building.
-MATT-
Okay. As you're doing that, I need you to roll a deception check with advantage because you're helping.
-TALIESIN-
Magnets, how the fuck do they work? That's nice. 21.
-MATT-
21! As soon as you spray in the face, he's like (sputtering). Takes the scarf off and (panting) "Sit down, please!" He points over to a bench on the side.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to start crawling along the floor and i'm going to cut myself a little bit on my neck. Since I'm used to it, I don't mind a little blood. I'm giving myself a good cut, maybe there'll be a little ice fleck. I don't know if I want to activate that, if it'll work on my fingernails, but what the fuck. I'm going to start crawling, leaving a trail of vomit into the next room, going, no! No!
-MATT-
Take a point of damage.
-TALIESIN-
Yup.
-TRAVIS-
I go the opposite direction he starts walking. (hacking cough)
-MATT-
The clerk at this point goes, "Please! Stay tight, I'm going to-- shit!" He leaves the room.
-SAM-
Go, go, go, go!
-LIAM-
We peer in the door. What is going on in this room at this point?
-MATT-
You walk in as you see there's a spray of stuff across the clerk's counter. You see both Mollymauk and Fjord crawling in opposite directions across the floor as you hear footsteps, and the clerk had just rushed out of the chamber down the hallway.
-LIAM-
We are going to go between them like Noah through the water. Oh, that's the wrong -- Moses, yeah.
-SAM-
Like Noah through the ark!
-LIAM-
There's vomit and eggs everywhere!
-MATT-
What you see now is there's two hallways.
There's one to each side as you enter. Where the clerk's desk was, it looks like there's all the rooms you saw on the right side, all the rooms you saw on the left side, and there are chambers in the center of the building with the two hallways that bisect the two areas. You can choose right or left, it's up to you. The clerk went down the right side.
-LIAM-
I will take the left one if the clerk went down the right side.
-MATT-
Okay. As you're rushing with Nott in your arms, you head into the hallway on the left side and you glance and can immediately see another person with a robe, who is holding a small satchel of some sort of greenish material. They walk and see you. "Excuse me, can I help you?"
-LIAM-
(crying)
-SAM-
(baby wails)
-MATT-
Make a deception check, please.
-SAM-
Oh, no, me? That's a negative one. (shriek)
-MATT-
"What seems to be the problem?" He looks, as opposed to being empathically interested in your well-being, is genuinely disturbed by the sound the child is making, Rosemary's Baby style.
-LIAM-
Frumpkin appears on the back of the guy's neck and starts tearing in.
-SAM-
Oh, God, you're using it to attack? You can do that?
-MATT-
Roll an attack for Frumpkin, please.
-TRAVIS-
My allergies are going to be shit in about five seconds. My worst nightmare.
-LIAM-
Oh, my gosh, for a cat? I mean, it's a 13 plus I don't know what.
-MATT-
That hits, he's wearing a robe. Go ahead and roll.
-LIAM-
Starts clawing. One?
-MATT-
We'll say it's one point of damage, is a cat's scratch. As it's clawing, he's (screaming).
He starts screaming and grabs Frumpkin on his back and tries to pull him and throw him off. Frumpkin full-on spins, scatters, all claws and legs out, lands on the ground. (Angry cat sound) Full puff-up, tail and everything. At this point you watch another doorway flip open, and you see a man come out with very short brown hair on the sides with a pompadour in the front and a similar white robe, but it looks like it's longer-sleeved with more detail. He goes, "What is all this ruckus happening?"
-MARISHA-
Ooh, I hate him. I hate him already.
-MATT-
"What is a cat doing here? Get the cat!" He watches as the clerk says, "I don't -- shoo! Shoo! Shoo!" He's trying to get Frumpkin to leave now.
-TALIESIN-
Off in the distance you hear, You have no legal authority over me! (vomit)
-TRAVIS-
(hacking cough)
-MATT-
There's now other workers of the infirmary coming out of the rooms that are all starting to gather. The one who saw you in the hallway is now coming towards you while shooing Frumpkin out. You watch the guy who had left the chamber head back into the office and close it. People are starting to scatter. You guys are waiting in the two rooms now, you said? You found two separate rooms?
-TALIESIN-
I'm just running the hall.
-MATT-
You're just running the hall?
-TALIESIN-
I'm crawling in the hall.
-MATT-
What are you doing?
-TRAVIS-
I'm standing there like (hacking cough). I think I shit my pants!
-MATT-
So you're coughing loud in the room. You're crawling in the hall. Behind them?
-LIAM-
Is there enough chaos for us to step into one of these open rooms and shut the door behind us?
-MATT-
We'll find out in a second. Now we have you spitting and freaking out. The two clerks that are trying to push Frumpkin out are trying to escort you. They see you. They're like, “Sir? Sir?” They start grabbing your arms and lifting you up.
-TALIESIN-
(vomit) I'm still bleeding from the neck.
-MATT-
They start dragging you into one of the rooms on the side. They open one room and there's somebody in there already who was sleeping but is starting to come to, going, "What's happening?" "Sorry!" They close the door, go to the next chamber, and start dragging you into an empty room.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to immediately -- I'm going to go limp.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Then the minute the door's open, I'm going to make a break for it.
-MATT-
All right. They open the door--
-TALIESIN-
I'm out!
-MATT-
You bolt?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to bolt. Full speed.
-MATT-
Make an athletics check.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Athletics or acrobatics? Athletics?
-MATT-
Actually, this would be your choice.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yay. That's nice. Nine?
-ALL-
Nine!
-MATT-
You try and pull away, but in the moment, they're genuinely worried about your well-being.
They've probably had patients try and make big physical actions while they're in their care, and they hold you back.
-TALIESIN-
It's magic! I'm possessed! I turn to one and go, (in a guttural voice) The power of Christ compels you! I'm going to use Devil's Tongue and I'm going to do a couple points of damage to him.
-MATT-
Devil's Tongue or Vicious Mockery?
-TALIESIN-
Vicious Mockery.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, lord. Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
It's only a couple points.
-MATT-
Okay. That's 11. What's your DC on it?
-TALIESIN-
On Vicious Mockery? Where's my -- I'm not used to magic. It's so weird.
-MARISHA-
I'd like to say, I feel pretty good about our casing mission.
-MATT-
What's your charisma modifier?
-TALIESIN-
Charisma modifier is zero.
-SAM-
Your modifier's right there.
-TALIESIN-
Is it? I'm blind. Where does it go?
-MATT-
It's fine. They succeed. You shout this and one of them (groan). They grab and throw you into the room. You (whoosh) into the chamber and they close the door, pushing you inside of it.
-TALIESIN-
It would've been a plus three modifier, sorry.
-MATT-
Well, what's the DC of the spell is what I'm asking?
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to find that. I'm not used to magic.
-MATT-
That's okay.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, never mind.
-MATT-
It's fine. They shove you into the chamber.
They close the door. You land on the ground and you hear it lock behind you.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
You are now a dangerous patient who needs other glancing. While that's happening and they're distracted by that, you guys--
-LIAM-
Look for an empty room. Or is every room in the house full?
-MATT-
I'd say about half of them are full. You see two chambers that are empty.
-LIAM-
I go in and shut the door behind us.
-MATT-
All right. You close the door. You guys both make stealth checks real fast.
-LIAM-
A one.
-SAM-
21.
-MATT-
All right. You enter the room and close it.
What are you doing?
-SAM-
What are we doing in here? We have to go back to the office!
-LIAM-
Yeah, but he's in the office.
-SAM-
We could -- You're right. Maybe we should just leave. Molly and Fjord will be fine, we'll just leave.
-LIAM-
We don't know. That's a no, we're working together. We're trying to work together with people. No, we have to get all of us out of here, which is more important than finding this asshole in the building. What do we do, what do we do?
-SAM-
We have some-- We could-- I'm looking. What do we got? We could do Enemy of My Enemy?
-LIAM-
That seems extreme at this moment.
-SAM-
(stammering) You could set the place on fire.
You could-- I don't know what to do!
-MATT-
(knocking) "Hello? Is there somebody in here?"
-SAM-
Shh!
-MATT-
The door opens and you see that there's a clerk who had apparently heard the door close behind you as you had entered the room and is now walking into this darkened chamber. As soon as the door opens, you guys are on the opposite side of the door. He walks over towards the lantern in the corner to light it, because the room is dark that you're in. There's nobody in there at the moment.
He walks over.
-LIAM-
Let's go. Out we go.
-SAM-
Okay, let's go! We're going to run out the door.
-MATT-
"Oh, wait! Wait!" You guys bolt past into the hallway. You guys dart out to the entrance and out into the night air.
-SAM-
Wait, out of the hospital or just out of the room?
-LIAM-
I wasn't saying that, but I don't mind.
-SAM-
Just out of the room.
-MATT-
Oh, just out of the room. You guys are out of the room and the person sees you.
-LIAM-
No, but we'll go down the hall towards the front of the building to look for, I would assume, Fjord and Molly at this point.
-MATT-
Well, you guys find Fjord there, coughing loudly, while you are currently locked in this room.
-TALIESIN-
I know. Is there a window?
-MATT-
There is.
-TALIESIN-
In the door?
-MATT-
Yeah. Well, no. There's a door, it's a closed solid door, and there's a window looking outside.
-TALIESIN-
(cackling) Are there bars on the window?
-MATT-
There's not. No. There is one cross bar that is maintained, it's more to support the four panes of glass, but that's it.
-TALIESIN-
All right. I'm going to peek out the door to see if anybody's coming for a minute.
-MATT-
Peek out the door?
-TALIESIN-
I mean the little door window.
-MATT-
Sorry, there's no window in the door.
-TALIESIN-
No window in the door and the door is locked. Okay. I'm going to start gently meditating on breaking the window, or opening the window if it'll open.
-MATT-
Okay. While you're meditating on that--
-LIAM-
Is Fjord alone in this room?
-MATT-
Fjord is alone in the room.
-LIAM-
I turn and show him Nott.
-SAM-
We got to go!
-TRAVIS-
Did you get anything?
-SAM-
No.
-TRAVIS-
Well don't give up! (cough) I walk out towards them. Do you have a privy? I think I shat myself.
-MATT-
There are two clerks now that were originally fleeing to get help and have come back now with the gentleman with the short brown hair, who's exited the opposite side of the chamber now.
"We've brought the doctor." He moves before the doctor, who approaches. "All right, so you appear to be sick."
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. (cough) I have a terrible cough and apparently my breakfast didn't agree with me and I coughed a little too much and felt a pack in my pants.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-SAM-
Is this the doctor that we saw before?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
15. 16.
-MATT-
16? He goes, "All right. Please have a seat in this chamber."
-TRAVIS-
I think I got shit in my pants. Can I visit the bathroom real quick? I don't want it running down my thighs and stuff.
-MATT-
"There's an outhouse about two blocks down outside. Come back -- "
-TRAVIS-
You don't have anything in the building?
-MATT-
"Get in the room. We'll get you a pan."
-TRAVIS-
All right. Yeah. I go in the room.
-MATT-
You go in the room, and one of them pulls out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side.
-TRAVIS-
Can I have a little privacy while I check my undercarriage?
-MATT-
They close the door immediately and then turn to you two: “We’ll get to him in a second.
What’s your problem?”
-LIAM-
(soft voice) Fever. She has a fever.
-MATT-
“Let me see her.” He comes forward and puts his hands out towards Nott.
-SAM-
(hisses)
-MATT-
Do you do that? Make an intimidation check with advantage.
-SAM-
Intimidation? Negative three?! How is that possible? 13.
-MATT-
13. The physician goes (screams), falls back. The other two clerks or physician helpers catch him: “Get it out! Get it out! Out! Shoo!”
-SAM-
I’m going to scamper towards the office if I can, as fast as I can.
-MATT-
Make an acrobatics check to try and dodge past their grasp as you begin to dart through their--
-SAM-
Oh god. Nine? They got me. They got me, guys.
-MATT-
As you run, all of a sudden there’s a tug on your cloak and the same younger physician who had told you to get out is clutching the back of your cloak and lifts you up off the ground. “Well then, someone’s going to play nice with the Crownsguard,” and turns and starts bringing you towards the exit. “You too, outside!”
-SAM-
Oh no. This couldn’t have gone better.
-TRAVIS-
Am I in the room by myself?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Can I cast Disguise Self and give myself the same sort of clerk/orderly outfit as…
-MATT-
Yeah, easily.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe not looking exactly like one of them, but like them in a uniform.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. Can I exit the room and come out into the hall?
-MATT-
You exit out and the two other ones are looking a bit confused. He’s currently dragging Nott who’s flailing on the edge of the cloak, dangling, out into the main area.
-TRAVIS-
Get him out of here. I walk past them, towards the office where the doctor is.
-MATT-
Okay. He goes and throws you out onto the street. Pushes you out, Caleb, and goes “Guard!” and begins pointing loudly over there, down in the direction of where you tumbled and landed on the ground.
-LIAM-
Wait, so who’s where outside?
-MATT-
You guys got shoved out into the front of the facility. Nott got tossed, landed, and stumbled a few feet, and they’re now shouting for the guard and pointing at Nott.
-LIAM-
Pointing at us? Okay.
-SAM-
Enemy of My Enemy now?
-LIAM-
(groans) That still seems extreme. We should just book it.
-SAM-
Are you fast? All right, fine. I’m not leaving you. I’m much faster than you.
-MATT-
You guys start bolting?
-SAM-
We’re going to start to run.
-MATT-
As you guys run, they don’t give chase because it’s not their job to do so, but they start shouting and shouting. I want you both to roll stealth checks to try and see if you can avoid the sight of the Crownsguard that are in the process of responding to the shout.
-SAM-
15 from me.
-LIAM-
Only a ten for me.
-MATT-
Okay. As you guys dart into the nearby shadows, plugging down a few alleyways, you hear some voices in the distance, some conversations, some shouting, and then some footfalls that get loud... and then get a little softer, and eventually a little softer and fade off. You just barely scraped by on that one.
-MATT-
You, however, darted off towards the open office and as soon as you glance in there, you can see there is a desk set up, there is a chair, there are a number of large books and stacks of parchment. It looks like there is a whole rack up top with various medicinal herbs and salves that are categorized into small makeshift cubbies. This is where a lot of the treatment seems to be mustered.
-TRAVIS-
Can I turn, and as I start to close the door behind me, can I look down the hallway and see if anybody is walking towards me in the hallway. Is it relatively clear?
-MATT-
Well, it’s clear for the moment, but the man who was just in this office just finished throwing Nott outside and is in the process of talking with the Crownsguard. You don’t know how long you have until he returns.
-TRAVIS-
Can I grab a handful of papers off the desk and put them under my shirt and start walking out?
-MATT-
You palm a bunch and throw it in there, all right. You exit, just as you see them returning to the hallway with the physician straightening his outfit, making his way in your direction. Doesn’t even make eye contact with you, just brushes by and shoulder-checks you, which is hilarious because the size of your visual is much smaller, so it’s like (impact) “Watch it!” and was two inches away, but doesn’t seem to notice in the moment that he actually did so. Makes his way into the office, you hear the door close behind you, and the two other clerks frustratingly start scattering and making their way to the other chambers. One of them is talking to the other about, “I don’t know what happened. He went crazy and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere,” and they’re both making their way to the door where Molly is in.
-TRAVIS-
That was very unruly; I need to excuse myself for a moment. I’ll head out of the infirmary.
-MATT-
Okay. You head back out onto the street. You are in that chamber for a while. Are you doing anything?
-TALIESIN-
How long has it been?
-TRAVIS-
I’m heading out of the infirmary and I’m going to start wrapping around the building towards the side of the building that he was in.
-TALIESIN-
I’m seeing how-- is it possible to open the window?
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-TALIESIN-
God, all these numbers I used to be good at, but I’m not good at anymore. Ten.
-MATT-
Ten. Nothing easily does so. You can try and pry one of the panes out, but there’s a decent chance it might break in the process if you’re not careful.
-TALIESIN-
That’s fine.
-MATT-
You’re going to try? You take one of your blades and you wedge it up underneath where the metal bar is, it’s holding the pane in place to see if you can wedge it out. Go ahead and make a straight dexterity check.
-TALIESIN-
Nope. One.
-MATT-
It shatters and breaks on both sides of the window. You watch as the window shatters outward--
-TALIESIN-
I’m going to jump out of it.
-MATT-
The pane itself is about that big, so you’re going to take more of the window with you to do it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that’s okay.
-MATT-
All right! You shoulder-roll-leap through, shattering the window out of the infirmary, rolling into the alley. You see this happen as Molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and purple skin.
-TRAVIS-
Run!
-MATT-
You guys bolt. At this point, as you head back, you’ve now seen the guards that have just run off to go after Nott hear the shatter and turn around to begin, some of them, to double back to where the sound of the glass breaking came from.
-TRAVIS-
Can I point off in a different direction than Molly’s running, since I look like a hospital clerk nurse?
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-TALIESIN-
Carry me. I’m going to jump into your arms while you do that.
-LAURA-
No, no, he’s pointing the other direction!
-MATT-
It’s too late!
-TALIESIN-
Wait, no, I’m trying to understand the scene here. I thought they were looking at him.
-MATT-
They are.
-LAURA-
They’re looking at him, but you were running away.
-TALIESIN-
Well, if I’m already-- because I didn’t know if I was just standing--
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-MATT-
15. The guards approach and they both look antsy, but they see you pointing away, and they both head in the direction that you were heading them off towards, as Molly’s about to leap into your arms.
-TALIESIN-
I was already-- towards…
-MATT-
You guys have managed to find yourselves back into the chaotic evening of the streets of Zadash.
-LIAM-
I think I was imagining a small mom-and-pop place with two physicians, but like 50 people in white coats came out--
-MATT-
It’s like six.
-LIAM-
I think it was more like 72, Matt, let’s be honest.
-MARISHA-
In the meantime, me and Jester are like: What’s taking them so long?
-LIAM-
Oh, that only took five minutes to go that bad.
-MARISHA-
He took an hour to cosplay his dick!
-MATT-
Which is still there, by the way!
-TALIESIN-
I know, I’m going to save that for later.
-TRAVIS-
As we’re walking back, can I start looking over the papers, looking for some sort of signature that says Richter or Prucine or anything?
-MATT-
Yeah. As you guys make your way back to the Leaky Tap to eventually meet up, going through the paperwork, unfortunately, none of them have anything that signifies the High-Richter. They all seem to be various quick notes on bones breaks and resets, on various illnesses that have come through and treatments that have been applied, keeping tabs on return visits. It’s all various notes of--
-SAM-
Anything from his dad?
-MATT-
Nothing from Lord Sutan, unfortunately.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it was just on top of the desk.
-MATT-
If you had possibly searched a little longer, you could have maybe found something, you think, but given the circumstances, it did not occur.
-TRAVIS-
I don’t really have anything to hold him.
Crown of Madness!
-MATT-
So you didn’t find anything you wanted to, and you probably definitely fucked up a few people’s recovery routine. But that’s fine. You guys eventually find your way back to The Leaky Tap. Your monk and your cleric are waiting for you, and you watch as these four individuals walk in looking a bit haggard.
-TRAVIS-
Great success. Went off without a hitch.
-MARISHA-
Why are you covered in mayonnaise and egg?
-LAURA-
Why do you smell like beer?
-MARISHA-
And hot sauce? Is that hot sauce?
-TALIESIN-
That is, in fact, hot sauce. I’m going to empty out my canteen into the fire.
-LAURA-
Gross.
-TALIESIN-
I was making a distraction.
-TRAVIS-
We found Ren. We--
-SAM-
He’s heavily guarded. There was no way to get close enough.
-LAURA-
Did you go in and say “Can I speak to Ren?” and then somebody else go in his office while somebody was in the front asking to talk to Ren?
-TRAVIS-
That’s actually exactly what happened, it just didn’t go as well as you thought it might go.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Great minds think alike, though, Jester.
-TALIESIN-
Fools seldom differ.
-MARISHA-
You guys look real defeated, over here.
You look <i>palpably</i> defeated.
-SAM-
We almost had to kill an orderly.
-MARISHA-
What?!
-SAM-
It’s very embarrassing.
-LIAM-
That’s true, it came very close.
-TRAVIS-
How’d it go for you two?
-LAURA-
Oh, well, we cased out his house. We found a big tree that we can hop the fence with. Oh, and we bought this rope and this grapple so that we can climb.
-LIAM-
So you looked at the house and then you went shopping?
-LAURA-
Well, so that we can break into the house, yes.
-LIAM-
Tight, that’s tight.
-TALIESIN-
I jumped through a window.
-MARISHA-
You what?!
-TALIESIN-
Full glass, it was great.
-LAURA-
Is that what all of these things are?
-TALIESIN-
Well, some of those are sequins, but yes, essentially.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-SAM-
It was a good dry run for our real heist that we’re going to be doing in a day. So we’re working out the kinks…
-TRAVIS-
Not promising.
-TALIESIN-
It’s not about the plan, it’s about the desire to improvise.
-LAURA-
I cast Cure Wounds on Molly.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yay. I had very little, so thank you for that.
-MARISHA-
You know this could lead back to make it look suspicious if we go after Lord Sutan if his son was just broken into, right?
-SAM-
Well, don’t worry about that because they definitely saw our real faces.
-LIAM-
Not my face.
-SAM-
Oh yes, you’re right. They only saw my real face, so maybe that’s okay.
-MARISHA-
He’s going to know his medical notes are missing, right?
-TRAVIS-
It’s an infirmary. They got to see terrible people in there all the time.
-LIAM-
Yeah, agreed. In hospitals, you see all nature of people.
-MARISHA-
All right, okay.
-LAURA-
Yeah, nobody mentioned anything about needing handwriting, right?
-SAM-
No, no.
-LIAM-
No, there was not a lot of--
-LAURA-
No talk of his father at all, right--
-LIAM-
There was not a lot of talking, in fact.
-TALIESIN-
It was probably just an attempt to steal medicinals.
-MARISHA-
Sure, sure. All right.
-LAURA-
Well, we have Ren’s handwriting. We could potentially put a note in somebody’s house with his stuff, but I don’t know if that’s what the plan is.
-MARISHA-
Well, I mean, that works because as Dolan said, these fancy people tend to get other people to write their mail and do their paperwork for them, so…
-LIAM-
Well, it could add credibility to the tapestry that we’re trying to weave here. The goal is still to get into Sutan elder’s home and get this seal.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that never changed.
-LIAM-
Within the writings that we forge we could include some by the junior Sutan, so that would add some credibility to what we’re doing.
-TRAVIS-
Might get us in past that outer wall, at least.
-LIAM-
We still have to figure out what we are going to-- if we are starting at Sutan’s house, then… We don’t have any writing of the High-Richter’s; we are either trying to focus on finding that somehow or, going on what you were discussing which is creating the appearance of an underling, or a for-hire of the High-Richter’s, or some kind of code saying that they are communicating with Sutan elder on behalf of the High-Richter, yeah?
-MARISHA-
Nott, over here, knows a little bit of Thieves’ Cant.
-SAM-
Do you need me to write something?
-MARISHA-
It would look shifty.
-SAM-
I could do that--
-MARISHA-
I’m just saying, from my experience, normally if you’re trying to do a coup--
-LIAM-
Experience as a what?
-MARISHA-
As a rebellious teenage woman. In my experience, normally if you’re trying to do something bad, you’re not like “Dear diary, I did this bad thing. Signed, Beauregard.” You get what I’m putting down?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it’d be obvious.
-MARISHA-
Correct. We want to look-- if it’s too obvious, it’s the opposite of convincing.
-TRAVIS-
Sign it somebody else’s name.
-MARISHA-
This guy goes by The Gentleman because he is smart. That’s all I’m saying.
-LIAM-
We want to put information in Sutan’s house-- elder-- right? We could have some sort of writing that is not from the High-Richter, but that says “H-R would prefer the plans to go into motion--"
-LAURA-
“H-R wants a meeting with you.”
-MARISHA-
“Spoke to The Myriad,” yeah…
-TALIESIN-
“Finalized the plans.”
-LIAM-
I propose that we make it seem like Sutan and the High-Richter were conspiring to have Orentha killed. So we have a note put into Sutan’s house that says: “On behalf--” from an intermediary, “On behalf of HR, wants the plan to go into motion immediately and that Orentha will be out for the festival tonight.
-LAURA-
The Big O. We should say Big O.
-LIAM-
The Big O. That is good.
-SAM-
We are so much better than the other people at planning like this.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Then we plant that in Sutan elder’s house when we successfully, quietly break in.
-LAURA-
I’ll start writing that note right now.
-SAM-
In block letters? Can’t be traced to anyone? That sort of thing?
-LIAM-
Well, it’s an intermediary, so does not have to look--
-MARISHA-
It doesn’t really matter.
-LAURA-
I’ll make it look crisp and--
-SAM-
Make it look like evil calligraphy.
-LAURA-
Yeah, like evil handwriting.
-LIAM-
This letter perhaps on its own is not enough, but with the seal, if we have a matching letter planted in HR’s home--
-LAURA-
Yeah. Got your messages. I will move the meeting up and the Big O is going to die for sure.
-SAM-
Ooh yeah!
-MARISHA-
And a little bribery if we’re trying to go for something.
-LAURA-
But where are we going to get this money you keep talking about?
-TALIESIN-
We can just promise them money.
-LAURA-
Here’s the thing, having seen people be bribed before: you need very large sums of money for bribing. Especially with rich people. They’re not going to need 500 gold to do this sort of thing, they want 5000 gold for this sort of thing.
-MARISHA-
It depends. If you’re just handing money off to an assassin. If it’s a lowly level person, might not need much. Doesn’t need to be the whole amount. Just needs to be a payment, maybe.
-SAM-
A check?
-LAURA-
A check? An IOU. “On behalf of HR-- “
-LIAM-
Keep your writing very plain. Not immensely charming--
-SAM-
Traceable!
-LIAM-
No, I mean not charming, like the way you speak.
-LAURA-
So no hearts above the i’s then?
-LIAM-
No. No.
-LAURA-
I write, “On behalf of HR-- “
-LIAM-
Yeah, that’s good.
-LAURA-
What comes after that?
-MARISHA-
The Big O thing. The plan against the Big O.
-LIAM-
“HR would like the plan to be moved forward.”
-MARISHA-
“It will commence-- “
-TRAVIS-
“As discussed.”
-MARISHA-
“Commence as discussed.”
-SAM-
Sounds official.
-LAURA-
“On behalf of HR, the plan-- “
-LIAM-
“The plan is moving up to tomorrow night, at the festival.”
-LAURA-
“The plan is moving up to tomorrow night, at the festival.”
-LIAM-
“The moment has come, and it is time for us to seize it.”
-LAURA-
That’s what I write.
-MATT-
Okay. You work out the logistics of that letter--
-MARISHA-
And it sounds super boss.
-LAURA-
“Yours truly, forever and ever, your BFF-- “
-SAM-
No, no!
-LAURA-
No?
-SAM-
Take out the part where you say, “Do you like me? If so, check this box.” (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I thought that tied the whole thing together.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I thought it was good.
-TRAVIS-
And no perfume on the letter.
-MARISHA-
Aw, you beat me to it! No signing it with a kiss.
-LAURA-
If I fold it up like a little triangle.
Just a simple--
-TALIESIN-
What kind of dog?
-SAM-
What?
-MARISHA-
What kind of dog?
-LAURA-
Oh wait! Should I fold it or should I scroll it?
-SAM-
Scroll it! Because we’re going to--
-MATT-
The guard dog that was outside of the home?
-TALIESIN-
There’s a guard dog.
-MATT-
It was a mastiff.
-TALIESIN-
It was a mastiff? Was it a well-kept dog or-- was it a dog of pride or just a dog of--?
-MATT-
From what you guys saw of the mastiff, it wasn’t a show dog by any means, but it wasn’t a street dog they’re just using for the moment.
-TRAVIS-
Was it a talking mastiff?
-MATT-
One way to find out!
-TALIESIN-
Does it look like the sort of dog that you can actually be proud of or is it just a utility?
-MATT-
It looks like it’s a utility dog. You’ve seen some dogs go around with members of the crownsguard before as part of the general-- It’s more for an intimidation tactic. They’re rarely ever utilized, but the presence of a dog just make some people, especially those who work in darker categories, unsettled.
-TALIESIN-
We have a cat.
-MARISHA-
Can the cat become a mastiff?
-LAURA-
Can the cat get the dog--
-LIAM-
To chase it away.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Then someone would have to get the dog back.
-SAM-
Just shoot the dog with an arrow and kill it.
-TALIESIN-
I’m just talking about getting the dog-- no!
-TRAVIS-
Nott.
-TALIESIN-
Somebody’s going to have to retrieve the dog if the dog goes running.
-MARISHA-
Here’s the deal, Nott--
-LIAM-
We don’t want a dead dog.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. we need to leave no trace. The only way this gets pulled off is if--
-TALIESIN-
This is the subtle one.
-MARISHA-
Is if no one thinks anyone was there.
Ever.
-SAM-
Show the dog your dick.
-TALIESIN-
I’m not showing anybody-- there’s no more of that. What if the dog runs? The guard will have to get the dog back.
-LAURA-
They’ll chase after the dog.
-LIAM-
Yeah. Frumpkin can do that very well.
-LAURA-
We can try that. If it doesn’t work, then we try to jump up and over.
-LIAM-
Also, sausages are very inexpensive, so we have that as a Plan B.
-MARISHA-
We also have good ol’ Fjord, who can always disguise himself as a guard.
-LAURA-
And relieve him.
-MARISHA-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Say that somebody really wants him over at the party.
-LIAM-
Are they private guards, though, or are they crownsguard?
-MATT-
They were assigned.
-LIAM-
Do you know what, Nott, if you want-- one idea, if you want to help, is you can also write a note in your Thieves’ Cant. It should be vague on details, but a message from the Myriad. Or don’t even get that specific, but write, in Thieves’ Cant, a note saying that everything is in place for the festival.
-MARISHA-
I think that’s a good idea.
-SAM-
All right. Sure. I need a few papers.
-MARISHA-
A few papers are always good.
-MATT-
All right. As you guys work your way through preparing this letter, condensing your plots for the next evening, and eventually find yourself to a night’s rest in preparation for the next day’s events, we’re going to take a break!
-LIAM-
No, but I think we should go back to the hospital one more time.
-MATT-
(laughs) Fucking D&amp;D.
-LAURA-
Watching your face, Matt, as all that was happening. You were like, what are they doing?
-MATT-
Those are my favorite moments of the game! I’m like, I don’t-- okay, guys! This is happening! This is all your fault.
-TALIESIN-
It was a great plan.
-MATT-
So yes, before we go to break, our friends at Wyrmwood have their giveaway for the evening.
You need to be in the Twitch chat room to participate. Right now, the offer's only good for residents of the United States and Canada, excluding Quebec, because, apparently, Quebec. For the official rules, you can find the link in the chat tonight, but tonight it is the Flame Box Elder Deck Box, which is pretty awesome. Oh, and it came with a Magic pack with a guy going (screams)
-LIAM-
Is he at the hospital?
-MARISHA-
Why is there a Magic pack in there?
-MATT-
It's a deck box. The pack comes with it, too. So go ahead and enter into the chat room-- the word for this break is “Heist”. H-E-I-S-T.
Remember, only enter it once. If you enter it more than once, you will be disqualified, unfortunately. We'll get to that, and we'll have the winner in the break. In the meantime, we'll see you back here in a few minutes.
[break]
Hello, and welcome back, everybody. We have a winner from the chat. Congratulations to PyroMalibu. PyroMalibu is the winner of the box.
Denoba will get your information in the chat if he hasn't already, and we'll get that to you, so congratulations. So, as you guys all prepare for the evening’s rest, the next day-- is there anything you needed to do before the next day happens?
-SAM-
I would like to talk to Caleb. (clears throat) Oh, Caleb? Nott here. I have a favor to ask of you. I absconded with some items recently, and I wanted you to take a look at them with your keen eye.
-LIAM-
Where did you get these items?
-SAM-
It was not-- I didn’t break in anywhere-- I mean, we did, but it was cool because other people were with me. It’s when we went down into the basement to scout around for other entrances into the bottom of the Leaky Tap.
-LIAM-
Under the Leaky Tap? And you found?
-SAM-
I found a skeleton that had these bracelets on her? Him? They?
-LIAM-
You found a skeleton?
-SAM-
Yeah, I don't know. I didn't really have time to look at it.
-LIAM-
You found a dead person?
-SAM-
A very old dead person. Could be ancient.
-LIAM-
Yeah, but it's not really typical to keep a dead-- like a skeleton in your basement.
-SAM-
I didn't think about that, but yes.
-TRAVIS-
Nor in your closet.
-LIAM-
Well, that's a topic for the group. We're staying in an inn where there was a dead person.
-SAM-
I don't think it's haunted or anything. It just seemed like someone-- it was stuffed way in the corner behind some boxes like someone wanted to--
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's worse. That's not better, that's worse.
-SAM-
I didn't-- I mean-- I'm really just interested in these.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Okay, well, that's somewhat unsettling, but show me these items that you have.
-SAM-
These are just bracelets that I found. I was wondering if you could use your magic skills.
-LIAM-
I place them down on the bed and go through the process of casting Identify on them. It takes about ten minutes.
-MATT-
Okay. As you finish the focus, you glance down at them, extending your consciousness to see if there's any residual magic energy. They're not enchanted, but they are made of a very nice, solid platinum with a gold spiral lay on them, once you pull the dust off, so they’re probably worth a little bit of money.
-LIAM-
You should sell these. These are not little and adorable like buttons.
-SAM-
No, but they're shiny and nice.
-LIAM-
Do you want to wear them?
-SAM-
Ooh. Maybe I could.
-LIAM-
Well, you could. What--
-SAM-
Are they big?
-LIAM-
Are they huge for a goblin’s little wrists?
-MATT-
For a goblin’s wrists, they're pretty big.
Looks like they're more-- they may have been made for a more masculine figure’s wrists probably, or a thick-armed lass.
-LIAM-
Maybe your ankle or calf, you could put them on. Or sell them and then you could put them to use.
-SAM-
All right. Okay.
-LIAM-
I'm still a little disturbed that there's a dead person under this inn that we're in right now.
-SAM-
I understand. Well, we can go back and I can show you, if you'd like, but it didn't seem like--
-LIAM-
Well, I take your word for it, that it's there. I don't need to go poking about.
-SAM-
How do you do that? Where you look at something and you just see what it is?
-LIAM-
Well, it is a spell that I learned when I was--
-SAM-
It's so cool! It's very impressive.
-LIAM-
You could potentially learn this as well.
-SAM-
Really?
-LIAM-
Of course! If you apply yourself--
-SAM-
I don't know. You know so many spells and so many things. You're very strong. I'm continually impressed by you, I must say. How strong would you say you are? On a scale of one to 20?
-LIAM-
How do you mean-- I'm not very strong, Nott.
I do have things that I want to do with my life, and I mean to apply myself and study, and find knowledge.
-SAM-
Is that the way you'll get even stronger? Through study and books?
-LIAM-
<i>Ja.</i> That is the best way to do that. For anyone.
-SAM-
Would magical items help further your abilities or blessings?
-LIAM-
That seems like an abstract question. There are certainly very useful things that can be found in this world. You never know.
-SAM-
All right.
-LIAM-
Are you okay?
-SAM-
Oh, I'm fine, I'm just fascinated by all things wizard and I want you to succeed, that's all. I have great faith in you, I know you'll do great things, and I just want to help you get there.
-LIAM-
Well, thank you, friend.
-SAM-
Sure. Yes. Anything, anything to help the cause.
-LIAM-
Well, maybe we go to bed and tomorrow we don't tear the roof down off of every building we go into again, yeah?
-SAM-
Okay. Sounds good.
-LIAM-
So I take out my silver thread and I start casting the Alarm spell on our room before bed, and then I go to bed.
-MATT-
All righty. Anybody else have anything to do before the evening's rest, or are you happy to continue the next day?
-TRAVIS-
Next day for me.
-LAURA-
(shouting) Pillow fight!
-MARISHA-
Beau gets a little too aggressive with the pillow fight.
-LAURA-
Ow, okay. We're done.
-MARISHA-
Sorry, sorry.
-LIAM-
Mess with the bull, get the horns.
-MATT-
All right, so, as the evening comes to a close, the next morning greets you on a somewhat chilled, misty morning, the sky gray, but the light is out. You can see a faint mist is burning off of the streets in the early morning, like six or seven-ish. You all gather yourselves. Is there anything you wish to accomplish during the day, or do you wish to jump ahead to the meeting of the afternoon, the evening?
-MARISHA-
Should we get some awesome all-black clothes?
-LAURA-
Maybe we should so that we stealth better.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, something a little bit more stealthy.
-LAURA-
We can put it in the pink bag.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I like that.
-TALIESIN-
I was thinking some carnival masks, from the other direction.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, all black looks like you're up to no good.
-LIAM-
Yeah, and if you are actually in the dark, you can't tell the difference, and if you're in the light you look like a ninja, so I think we're good, maybe.
-MARISHA-
I see what you're saying. Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Everyone’s going to be pretty fancy-dressed.
-LAURA-
The carnival is going on today?
-MATT-
Yeah, the festival is happening this evening.
-MARISHA-
Do we know anything about this festival, like, culturally? Do they wear masks?
-MATT-
I mean, the harvest is celebrated at different points, and in a few weeks is the official Harvest End festival. This is done in advance, it's more of a private event that is for the more elite. Some folks come in from out of town, from local smaller townships that are pretty well off and trying to rub elbows with the local elite. It's a festival that contains food, music, drink. You've never been to one, of course, and you've heard of it from the time you spent in Zadash. You've never seen it, but you've seen folks take care through the street towards the event, and it seems to be fairly like a more subdued Mardi Gras colors, but the colors are more reds and browns and golds. They have masks they'll wear for it, but they aren't full face, just habitual eye masks. Only some will, some folks don't get fully into the spirit.
-MARISHA-
I think we should go shopping.
-TALIESIN-
Masks on sticks.
-MARISHA-
Masks on sticks.
-LAURA-
Well, we're not actually going to the fancy gala, so we probably don't need the fancy stuff, because it's just for the rich people.
-MARISHA-
But will it get us through the gate?
-LAURA-
Well, I figure for all of us to get in, we should go through the sewers, probably.
-TALIESIN-
If someone stops you, if you have a mask, they know why you're there.
-LIAM-
Yeah, in a pinch.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-LIAM-
A lot is riding on Sutan and the High-Richter going to this festival.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
That's it, that's all.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I was really expecting more there.
-LIAM-
No, it's just pessimism.
-LAURA-
Let's go buy some masks, then.
-MARISHA-
Are you afraid they're not party people?
-LIAM-
Well, I worry that if we break into Sutan's house and stuff a bunch of letters there, but the High-Richter stays in with a tummy ache, then it all falls apart.
-MARISHA-
Well, then we go from there.
-LAURA-
There's no point in worrying about things you can't change yet, Caleb.
-MARISHA-
She's got a point.
-TALIESIN-
Be the chaos you want to see in the world.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, no point in worrying, it only makes it hurt twice.
-LIAM-
Yeah, lead the way, I'll be the caboose.
-MATT-
All right. Who’s helming the expedition to acquire costume pieces?
-TRAVIS-
Molly.
-MATT-
Molly, go ahead and make an investigation check.
(laughter)
I'll say, because of your dress, I'll give you advantage on this.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-MARISHA-
Show us where Melrose is.
-TALIESIN-
Looking for Melrose. 11.
-MATT-
11. It takes you the better part of the morning. About noon, you manage to find a place that will sell similar outfits. Since a lot of them are either custom-made for the individuals that are going, it's hard to find a place. There is no shop that sells fancy clothes to the random folks who aren't going to the event, but you manage to find a few individuals that can cobble together a few masks and basic attire. Because it's a quick build, it's going to be a little pricier than normal cost, so the commission will take the better part of the afternoon, and will be ready by sundown for enough outfits for six of you. Or accoutrements.
-TALIESIN-
I was about to say, I don't need much.
-MATT-
You'll be fine, it's just a mask. I'd say between all of you, for the time, the materials, and the construction of it, it’ll run you about three gold pieces.
-TALIESIN-
I'll pay that.
-TRAVIS-
You'll pay for all of it?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah. I will get reimbursed at the end.
-LIAM-
I’ll pick up some sausages.
-MATT-
Okay. How many sausages do you want?
-LIAM-
Oh, just the one string of them. Four or five.
-SAM-
Maybe two strings.
-LIAM-
Two strings in case.
(laughter)
-MATT-
In case you get hungry? Fair enough. Okay.
That's going to put you back a silver.
-LAURA-
Oh, and I'm going to write another letter that says something about the Knights of Requital.
That says, like-- what should it be? "I'm glad to be working with you! You sure are nice!"
-TRAVIS-
What about a sign-off, like, "The Knights of Requital are rising."
-SAM-
What if you take a letter and just sign it “Knights of Requital” and rip off the rest, so who knows what it was, it's just from them.
-LAURA-
Yeah. I'll end it with, "the big red door.
The Knights of Requital." Then rip it, and then it is just the bottom part and leave it in the High-Richter's house.
-MARISHA-
Leave it in the trash. That's not bad, that's not bad.
-LAURA-
Oh, can somebody burn the edge like the rest was in the fire or something? Oh, and then we can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the letter was burned!
-MARISHA-
Man, that is the oldest trick in the book. Sure.
-LAURA-
Caleb, burn just these edges here.
-LIAM-
Okay, put it down on the ground.
-LAURA-
But just the edges, don't set the whole thing on fire, because I spent a really long time writing that little bit.
-LIAM-
Ah, well, then use a hearth fire or something, because I will probably put that into flames. Also, alternatively, would we want maybe something instead that said that "the Knights are ready for this evening’s pursuits, and they’re to support any endeavors as needed, great High-Richter. It is time for change."
-LAURA-
I write all of that, okay, fine.
-MARISHA-
Don't write “the Knights”, though, just write the little symbol.
-LAURA-
Yeah. Then I'll put the symbol. But I'm also going to keep this one to put in the fireplace, because I think it will be really cool.
-LIAM-
Yes, the two together, but I worry that just the one piece, she could have written it down on a list of things she does not like, it's not very conclusive. But the two together.
-SAM-
She doesn't like red doors, she doesn't like the Knights of Requital.
-LAURA-
Now we have those letters. I'm going to keep track, I'm putting them in the side pouch, those are the side pouch ones.
-LIAM-
Have you written your letter in your thieves’ thingy that you do?
-SAM-
Yes. I did. My handwriting is not as good.
-LAURA-
Is that going in Lord Sutan's place or the High-Richter's place?
-LIAM-
That's in Sutan's place.
-LAURA-
So I'm putting that in the other pouch.
-LIAM-
Good, we want to tie Sutan to the Myriad, and High-Richter to the Knights, and High-Richter and Sutan together. That's the plan.
-MARISHA-
To fight Orentha, to kill her.
-LIAM-
Yes, to take that seat. To enact the change that the people need.
-LAURA-
We are definitely-- this is going to be real good.
-MARISHA-
I feel so political, you guys. I feel like I'm participating in our politics, in a way.
-SAM-
It feels nice to participate in a democracy like this.
-MARISHA-
It does, it feels like I'm making a difference.
-SAM-
One monk, one vote.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Feels like it matters.
-LIAM-
Did we get paid in advance, by the way?
-LAURA-
What are we being paid for this?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, we didn't get paid in advance. I hope that doesn't come back to bite us.
-LIAM-
Did we get half of it, even?
-TALIESIN-
It's for the best, because now there's no paper trail, just in case they are trying to--
-LAURA-
Is Ulog around? I'm going to look for Ulog.
-MATT-
Ulog is meeting you guys, you want to try and search for him?
-LAURA-
I want to look and see if he's around us, though.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LAURA-
I can't see shit.
-MATT-
You have no idea where Ulog is, or if he's in the vicinity, unfortunately. All right, so.
-LIAM-
We should also-- you're invisible. We should also discuss who's going in, who's outside, how we are tackling each house.
-LAURA-
I should definitely go into Lord Sutan's place, because I have this really fun spell that lets me find things. So I could find the seal.
-LIAM-
How does it work?
-LAURA-
I go, "I want to find this wax seal," and it will help me find the one that’s closest.
-LIAM-
Then you're right, you should go in. Nott, you should go in, because you're going to pick locks, <i>ja</i>?
-SAM-
Yes.
-LIAM-
If anything is locked. I strongly believe that I should go in as well, because these are two very wealthy, powerful people, and there could be magical--
-LAURA-
You're going to steal some stuff?
-LIAM-
Only if that is, you know, easy to do.
-MARISHA-
Once again, we should leave no trace that we were there.
-SAM-
Don't worry about that. I'll eat everything we leave behind.
-TALIESIN-
Now I'm really worried about it, actually.
-TRAVIS-
I'll be out front, I can be a crownsguard if I need to.
-TALIESIN-
And I can be in the back and be drunk and lookout.
-SAM-
Which is our first house that we're attacking?
-TRAVIS-
Lord Sutan.
-SAM-
And we know that there's a guard and a dog out there.
-MARISHA-
Correct, so first--
-SAM-
So you guys need to distract the guard.
-MARISHA-
With the cat. We've got the cat plan.
-SAM-
And the sausage.
-LIAM-
And the sausage, just in case.
-LAURA-
Sausage for the guard, cat for the dog.
-LIAM-
Regardless, even if this goes belly-up, we just disappear. You know, we have no ties to this, we walk away, yeah? We just get out with our skins, even if things go as badly as they did at the hospital, and then we go, we just walk away.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, the last thing we want is for the crownsguard to think that this was all us.
-LAURA-
Where are we meeting Ulog?
-MARISHA-
In front of the--
-LIAM-
Oh also, Frumpkin is up here in my sort of scarf position, and I bring him down in my lap, and I take the sausages out, and I sort of like knead one of the sausages in my hand a bit, and I say, you know, I'm sorry, but the next time that you go off to your pocket place and come back, this will be gone. And I start squishing sausage grease into his hair, and rubbing it down his back so that he smells like sausage.
-TALIESIN-
That's a very good plan.
-LIAM-
I love you very much, so thank you for this, okay?
-ALL-
(angry cat noises)
-LAURA-
Do you want to eat him even more now?
-LIAM-
Some other time, perhaps.
-SAM-
I'll drink instead.
-MATT-
You gather the outfits that were commissioned for you. You have your materials. As the day grows later, eventually the sun begins to crest over the western mountain range. The sky, though cloudy still, the colors begin to shift to the oranges and purples of dusk. You begin to see carriages come through the streets and make their way towards the Tri-Spire district.
-LAURA-
Oh, I wonder if we can hide under the carriages and just ride in.
-MARISHA-
I was going to say, can we hop a ride?
-MATT-
One of the carriages just passed you, and it's about a block up the way if you want to try and catch up.
-MARISHA-
No, that brings a lot of attention, chasing after a carriage.
-LAURA-
It's all about trying to get into the sewer system.
-SAM-
Can't we just go to the sewers?
-LAURA-
Let's just go to the sewers.
-MATT-
All right. As you guys head back towards the entryway to the sewers, where you had previously been, with your various outfits and attire, you can see now, there's not two crownsguards, there's a single crownsguard at the moment. You approach and you see they're not directly against the grate, they're across the street. It doesn't appear to be watched at the moment.
-SAM-
The gate?
-MATT-
The entranceway into the sewers.
-LAURA-
Maybe I can go talk to the guard. Distract him?
-SAM-
It seems like they're not looking right now.
-LAURA-
Oh, he's not even looking at the gate?
-SAM-
No, they're not looking, we can just go.
-MATT-
Well, he's not looking at the entranceway to the sewer.
-MARISHA-
That doesn't mean that won't change in 30 seconds.
-LAURA-
It's dark outside, too?
-MATT-
Yes, but there are lanterns and stuff up on the side of the street.
-MARISHA-
Do you want to distract him and we'll meet you on the other side?
-LAURA-
Oh, sure! I'll go meet you at the sewer entrance on the other side.
-MARISHA-
Okay. Nott or Caleb can send you a message.
-LAURA-
Okay. I walk up to the guard.
-MATT-
Okay. "Evening."
-LAURA-
Evening, how are you doing today?
-MATT-
"I am well, how are you?"
-LAURA-
Pretty good. I was wondering if you could answer a question for me.
-MATT-
Everybody else, roll a stealth check, please.
-LAURA-
I was looking around this area earlier for a candy shop and I couldn't find <i>anything</i> that seemed good. I was wondering if you could point me in the best direction.
-MATT-
"Try the Pentamarket, probably."
-LAURA-
The Pentamarket, um, okay. Can you tell me exactly where that is? Because I'm not familiar with the area.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-LAURA-
Oh no. Oh, that's okay.
19!
-MATT-
"All right, so down this way--" and he starts giving you the full play-by-play of the street corners to the Pentamarket where a candy shop is that you had missed earlier. So now you know there's a candy shop in Zadash.
-LAURA-
Yay!
-MATT-
As it's happening. What did you roll?
-TRAVIS-
12.
-MARISHA-
15.
-LIAM-
Eight.
-SAM-
Natural one.
-LAURA-
Oh, come on.
-TALIESIN-
19.
-MATT-
Hold on, so a natural one, eight, 19, 15.
Okay, natural one’s tricky.
-SAM-
Plus eight.
-MATT-
Still a natural one. But, yeah, that brings it to nine. As you guys begin to quickly slide in, one after the other, Nott, as you're rushing down, you're glancing off, because you hear them talk about candy for a second over the side.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-MATT-
As you rush down the side, whack! You hit your head and give out a natural instinct, a pained squeak. As you do, the guard who's talking to Jester goes, “Wha--”
-LAURA-
(fake coughs loudly) Can you help me? I think I’m choking.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-LAURA-
Oh no. Seven.
-MATT-
Seven.
-LAURA-
(fake coughs loudly)
-MATT-
“Hold. Just a second.”
-LAURA-
Oh no, I can’t breathe at all, though.
-MATT-
He begins walking over to the sewer edge. He steps over and begins to glance down--
-LAURA-
I fall over on the ground and really like (choking sounds).
-MATT-
He’s looking back at you like--
-LAURA-
(choking sounds)
-LIAM-
I send Frumpkin screeching away from us, up the street, clattering into anything.
-MATT-
From where? Out of the sewer, you mean?
-LIAM-
Yeah, out of the sewer, yeah. I pop him back up.
-MATT-
As soon as Frumpkin-- He kicks and-- (gasps)
Misses.
(laughter)
-SAM-
It’s the same guy, it's the same guy!
-LIAM-
Caleb appears at the sewer like Pennywise the Clown.
-MARISHA-
Why is that their natural response in this town?
-MATT-
Well, he got scared by the cat! The first guy was a dick, this guy was (yells), like kicking wildly. Anyway. He falls back and Frumpkin runs off. He’s like (grunts). It seems to be enough to take him off the scent of Nott, and he turns around. “Miss?” He walks up and helps you up.
-LAURA-
Oh, it was my spit. I was choking on my own spit.
-MATT-
Right, all right. Well, go get your candy.
Have a good night.
-LAURA-
Thank you very much for all of your help.
-MATT-
(sighs) He goes back to his post. You guys make your way through the sewer, back up through the T-intersection--
-TRAVIS-
Mindful of the damn rats.
-MARISHA-
Rat-balloons.
-LIAM-
I held back two minutes to let Frumpkin quietly come back.
-MATT-
All right. Fair enough. Frumpkin does slowly make his way back to join you. You make your way towards the gate and, without issue, are entered into the Tri-Spire. You make your way towards the side of the alleyway where the--
-LAURA-
Oh, we didn’t meet the guy at the Song and Supper.
-MATT-
You did not.
-MARISHA-
Oh fuck!
-SAM-
What guy?
-MARISHA-
Shit! We were supposed to go fucking meet Ulog! Damn it!
-TALIESIN-
We’re so good at this.
-MATT-
Jester, do you want to go do that?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I just remembered it. I’m going to the Song and Supper Inn.
-TALIESIN-
We’re going to sit in the sewer like so much clown.
-MARISHA-
We recapped this at the break, too! Damn it!
-MATT-
You guys are sitting there, waiting for Jester to show up and meet you to let you out.
-SAM-
I cast Message a few times. We’re here. Where are you?
-TRAVIS-
Where letter-R letter-U?
-MATT-
You, however, you make your way to the Song and Supper, and on the inside, you can see, nervously at a table, in a dark cloak, Ulog. “What the--?” Gets up and meets you outside, shoves you back out there and you both begin to walk side-by-side. “I was waiting here long enough!”
-LAURA-
We were waiting for you! It’s so weird that we totally missed you, though.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-LAURA-
Well, well, well, 11.
-MATT-
He goes, “Right. Well, where’s the rest of your team?”
-LAURA-
They are-- Here’s the thing. How rich do you look? How rich does he look?
-MATT-
He looks down and he has fairly plain dark clothing for night-stealthing. He has like a single-- looks like a gold chain of some kind with a single yellowish amber-orange bead on it that looks like it’s worth a gold or two. Dark green-brown cloak. It’s hard to see the color, this late at night. He doesn’t look super rich.
-LAURA-
Can I put some of my costume on him?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I’ll put some of my festive wear on him.
-MATT-
You put some of the festive wear on him.
It’s all not at all fitted for him and it looks like a kid who has outgrown his snow-outfit and he’s like-- “This is humiliating.”
-LAURA-
It’ll get you in the door, don’t worry.
Here, put this mask on.
-MATT-
He’s seething beneath it. You can see him grinding his teeth, but he follows you nevertheless.
-TALIESIN-
Candy-themed, too.
-LAURA-
Oh, that’s great!
-MATT-
You make your way to the gate once more. The guards there-- One of them walks up and, the same one from earlier, gives you a nod. “Hold.”
-LAURA-
Guest of honor for the night. He’s a comedian.
-MATT-
Make another deception check.
-LAURA-
Come on! It is being so mean! Seven. God damn it.
-MATT-
He goes, “A comedian. Tell me a joke.”
-MARISHA-
Oh, come on, Ulog!
-MATT-
Ulog looks at you with the mask, back at the guard. “Um--”
-MARISHA-
It’s open mic night! You got this! (laughter)
-MATT-
He goes, “What do you call the king on his birthday?” The crownsguard goes, “I don’t know.
What do you call a king on his birthday?” “An arsehole.” The guard goes--
-LAURA-
Here’s the thing. He’s not a joke-telling kind of comedian. He’s more of a farce kind of comedian. Physical comedy. It’s more like a jester, if you will. And I push him and-- so he falls down. See?
-MATT-
(impact noise) At which point the two guards go: (laugh)
-LAURA-
He’s so good. He really sells it.
-MATT-
Ulog like gets off the ground and glares at you this very furious fiery stare and then gets up and then stumbles again and falls on the ground, flat again. The guard goes, "(laughs) All right, get in." Ulog now has like a bloody nose and as you ushers him in, he looks back. “Oh, we’re going to talk later.”
-LAURA-
But I got you in the door, right?
-MATT-
You eventually make your way over to the edge of the alley, coming up to the hatch that leads you out of the sewer. There you guys see the two approaching shapes of Jester and Ulog. Ulog looking festive, if the wear is a bit tiny, making his hair and beard poof out of the sides of the mask.
-MARISHA-
(pigeon coos)
-SAM-
Where have you been?
-LAURA-
I got Ulog.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit! We almost forgot about Ulog!
-LAURA-
I know!
-MARISHA-
Oh shit!
-SAM-
What’s Ulog’s job in this?
-LAURA-
I have no freaking clue! Hey Ulog, what do you want to do?
-MATT-
“Well, first off, I’m pretty keen at infiltration. I have a long past of doing sort of the breaking and entering thing. Plus, I want to be there when this happens. Have a personal stake."
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, he should be a part of the team that goes in.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
How well do you know Lord Sutan’s place and the area?
-MATT-
“I know the area alright.”
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
We cased it earlier.
-MATT-
“Do you think you know where he lives?”
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
“All right. That’s all we need. The rest we can all do. Lead on.”
-LIAM-
Can I insight check him? Just get a feel for that.
-MATT-
Yeah, go for it.
-LIAM-
That is 17.
-MATT-
17.
-SAM-
Whispers! Whispers!
-TALIESIN-
Mysterious whispers!
-SAM-
D&amp;D Beyond!
-TRAVIS-
And Far Cry 5!
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-SAM-
Far Cry 5! It’s five better than Far Cry 0.
-TRAVIS-
Or four better than the original.
-MARISHA-
The fiviest.
-SAM-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Takes place in America.
-SAM-
Montana.
-LIAM-
Guys, it’s Larkin.
-MATT-
Well there goes the campaign. As you guys make your way through the city streets, you can see the closer you get to the Silken Terrace, for one, the usual silk banners that adorn the various edges of the streets have been changed from the usual white silk banners to bright yellows, bright browns, bright reds. The colors of autumn are now starting to show and appear throughout the vicinity.
-MARISHA-
I hate the color yellow.
-TRAVIS-
Really? Why?
-MARISHA-
I just hate it.
-LAURA-
It would look really pretty on you.
-TALIESIN-
I don’t think that’s true.
-SAM-
No, I don’t think so.
-LAURA-
I think yellow would look good on you.
-TALIESIN-
The blue works. Stick with it, you know.
-SAM-
More of a spring…
-MATT-
You also hear the music begin to swell at the various performing bands towards the center where this gala is. You can see all the banners leaning in the center space. The sunset colors have vanished and now the night sky holds above.
The Crownsguard are clustered in greater numbers in the Tri-Spire, specifically to keep a perimeter around the event. As you glance off to the entrance gate where you were, you can see there’s now stationed more towards that space, since you originally passed through. More musicians are arriving, some locally, some appear to be from other areas within the actual Empire. The social elite are gathering in the center of the Silken Terrace and you can now see the small carriages are stopping and letting other individuals out to join the crowds, the mingling beginning. You can already see about 60 or 70 people, with more still arriving. They all have their various colors and masks on. They’re all grabbing drinks and laughing and seeing old friends and introducing themselves to new people they haven’t met before. Some of them live in the Tri-Spire, some that live throughout and beyond.
-MARISHA-
Any of them look familiar?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-MARISHA-
Don’t fuck me, Gil! Meh, you kind of fucked me there.
-LIAM-
May I also do the same thing?
-MARISHA-
Ten.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
No, no good. Eight.
-MATT-
Unfortunately, you’re too far away and the masks obscure any of sort of details. You’re unable to see anyone you recognize, per se. But you do see that there are long tables that mark the perimeter that are already holding already preset glasses of wine and ciders. You can see the central tower of the Triumph Chime sits glowing right at the front and center of this gala. It’s all surrounding the base of it. And up in a spiral you can see lanterns and similar colors of autumn that spiral up the front of it. You guys begin to, carefully, and out of sight, make your way towards the estate of Lord Sutan. Please make stealth checks, everybody.
-LIAM-
This is a lot of people.
-LAURA-
Oh wait. Who sucks?
-MARISHA-
Fuck!
-LIAM-
I rolled well.
-LAURA-
Who hasn’t rolled yet? Taliesin I give you a blessing.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Advantage. That’s awesome.
-TRAVIS-
14.
-MARISHA-
Why does it feel like you roll crappier when you’re lower level? 13.
-LIAM-
17.
-SAM-
13.
-LAURA-
20.
-TALIESIN-
19.
-TRAVIS-
Uh!
-MATT-
Pretty good spread. You guys duck in between, avoiding being seen and blend in with the crowd as you pass other individuals that are making their way to the actual Gala event. There are nods and smiles, occasional laugh, as folks are conversing and chatting as they pass. You make your way over to the outskirts of the Gilded Willows, beyond the Skyscape Park and where the Constellation Bridge tower stands, to see, for many of you the first time, the three-story dark wood home of Lord Sutan. The marble pillars mark the cornerstones of where the metallic iron fence gate matches the perimeter. There’s a singular tree and still there are two guards posted at one and the same guard with the dog at the other.
-MARISHA-
Same guard.
-SAM-
Must be getting tired.
-LIAM-
I’m sorry. Can you set the scene? Two guards at one end and one at the other?
-MATT-
Well it’s been a day later.
-MARISHA-
Are we catching them around the same time? This is his shift. Same watch.
-MATT-
Seems to be.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LIAM-
And it’s like corner-corner or front and back or…?
-MATT-
If look at the-- if the building’s a square.
The house is mainly built as a rectangle, there’s the front door and the back where the cellar door is and there’s the perimeter fence.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
In the front, there are two guards. In the back, where the gate and the cellar door is, there’s a singular guard and his dog. The tree is up on this side.
-LAURA-
But there’s still a gate--
-MARISHA-
All the way around. With the spikes.
-LIAM-
The guard with the dog is within this perimeter of fence?
-MATT-
It’s just on the interior of it. Just within the gate.
-MARISHA-
And the gate is closed.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
How wide are the openings in the gate? Does it look like the mastiff could get through the openings in the wrought-iron fence?
-MATT-
Probably not, no.
-MARISHA-
But he can still be enough of a distraction to get the guard to chase the dog while we get in if we can get the dog--
-LIAM-
To the front side of the home.
-MARISHA-
Maybe to the front side.
-LIAM-
Maybe temporary though.
-SAM-
We can get in through the gate and then we get to the tree or we’re going to go straight into the cellar?
-MARISHA-
That’s what I was thinking. Go into the cellar.
-LAURA-
We could use the tree to get over the fence and then run to the cellar.
-MARISHA-
As soon as the dog chases away the cat.
-LIAM-
Yeah, but what about our exit? Because we have to come back out.
-MARISHA-
Well--
-SAM-
We worry about that later?
-LIAM-
No, no, we worry about that now.
-MARISHA-
Maybe that’s when Fjord can come and relieve the guards?
-TRAVIS-
I can do that now.
-MARISHA-
Or he can do that now. But how do we get Fjord on the other side of the gate?
-LAURA-
He walks up to him and say--
-SAM-
That’s very risky now because what if the guards says “I don’t know you,” you know? Then the plan never starts. If we do that at the end, at least we have a fighting chance.
-TRAVIS-
That’s true. I could wait.
-LIAM-
I don’t like being stuck in there though.
-LAURA-
Ulog? What do you think? You’re really good at this.
-MATT-
“Who’s staying outside?”
-TRAVIS-
I am.
-TALIESIN-
I am.
-MATT-
The two of you. All right.
-MARISHA-
What were those guards’ names? There were so many guards.
-TALIESIN-
What <i>were</i> those guards’ names?
-LAURA-
That was at the High-Richter’s house. That wasn’t here.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah that was at the High-Richter’s.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, but as long as you do a guard that’s semi-recognizable.
-MATT-
“If we can manage, if what you’re saying about this tree, we can possibly scoot past their visual range and not have to worry about it. And just use that as a backup.”
-LAURA-
Right.
-MATT-
“But we got to climb the tree.”
-LAURA-
We can climb a tree. We’re good at that.
-TRAVIS-
The tree means worst case scenario.
-LAURA-
And I got this grapple, so we can swing across to the roof on the other side.
-MATT-
“All right. Those that are staying at the base. The rest of us, let’s get to climbing.”
-TALIESIN-
If we hear the dog bark, we can walk by.
-LIAM-
Also, I have another question. How far from the fence to the home?
-MATT-
It’s about five feet.
-LIAM-
Five feet only.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, but spikes.
-LIAM-
I’m rethinking. If Frumpkin gets away from this dog in the beginning, he can run outside the fence and he will not be far from me. I can stay in touch with him, so when it’s time to leave I can have Frumpkin reenter the yard and create mayhem a second time.
-LAURA-
Or let him create it the first time, because we might not need it.
-LIAM-
We might not, but if we have no other option and we’re trying to get out and there’s guards in both places, Frumpkin can come in and create mayhem again. Anyway, just an option.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
"We get to the top, you use your little cat thing to distract it. Preferably the other side of the fence."
-LIAM-
He's just a cat.
-MATT-
"Right. Your cat. On the other side of the fence. While they're faced and focused in that direction, we make our ascent."
-LAURA-
We swing it over. Somebody needs to make a loud noise when we throw the grapple over.
-SAM-
You can cough or something.
-LAURA-
So that it doesn't make a clang sound that they hear.
-MATT-
"That might be on one of you."
-LIAM-
A natural sound.
-MATT-
"All right."
-SAM-
I will signal you when we are grapple throwing.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
If you also hear me make the same sound again, that means trouble.
-LAURA-
I could maybe use, like, Thaumaturgy to create a thunder sound.
-SAM-
Ooh, that's good.
-LAURA-
If it happens at the same time.
-MATT-
"Actually not a bad idea."
-LAURA-
Okay, I'll do that.
-LIAM-
How's the weather; is it clear or grey?
-LAURA-
Sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere.
-MATT-
It's cloudy.The sky itself is cloudy, and has been. Even though the storm blew by, it's still pretty heavy cloud cover.
-LAURA-
Oh, good.
-MARISHA-
All right. Up the tree!
-TALIESIN-
If you hear me make noise--
-MATT-
Those who are climbing the tree, athletics checks please.
-MARISHA-
I'll go first, so I can try and help anyone else as I go up. Can I do that?
-MATT-
Yeah, you can do that. So Beau goes first.
-MARISHA-
Athletics or acrobatics?
-MATT-
For climbing, we'll say athletics.
-MARISHA-
(whimpers)
-MATT-
It doesn't have a lot of branches.
-MARISHA-
But parkour.
-LAURA-
Do we get advantage because Beau's helping us?
-MARISHA-
That's not great--
-LIAM-
Well, she's got to get up there first.
-MARISHA-
I got to get up there.
-LIAM-
She didn't roll that good.
-MARISHA-
Eight.
-MATT-
Eight? Well, you're not helping anybody.
(chuckles) You get partway up, and Ulog is actually, like (grunting). He's doing fine. So he pushes you up the rest of the way.
-MARISHA-
Give me a boost!
-LAURA-
Shh!
-MARISHA-
(whispers) Sorry!
-SAM-
I rolled an 18.
-MATT-
You climb up fine, skittering up past them.
You actually climb over Beau and Ulog to get to the top first.
-SAM-
Watch my nails.
-LAURA-
I rolled 11.
-MATT-
11? That's fine. You manage to get up there.
And Caleb?
-LIAM-
17.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
You guys all get up there. Beau is the last to arrive.
-MARISHA-
(pants)
-SAM-
I thought you were a monk of some sort.
-MARISHA-
I'm sprinter. I'm not an endurance person. Okay?
-MATT-
It's one if those things, too, where she starts first, but each person keeps putting their feet in her face on the way up.
-SAM-
You're all legs and no arms.
-MATT-
Okay, you guys get up to the top of the tree.
You're up in the branches, in the bow, at the top. You can see now, it's a beautiful view of the gala in the distance. You can see the three towers, all arcing up, all lit from underneath from the lanterns and the light that have been significantly brightened for the events of the evening. You have a clear shot of the rooftop, which is at a slight decline from this current position. It's about ten feet from you, and about three feet down below. You can see there are two smokestacks that look like they're attached to fire places that might be good indicators of places to connect the rope. Who's throwing the rope?
-LAURA-
Should I try it?
-MARISHA-
You're strongest.
-SAM-
What is this? Why do--?
-LAURA-
It's a grapple. Connected to a rope.
-SAM-
All right.
-LAURA-
So I hand the other side of the rope to Ulog so it doesn't fall.
-MATT-
He takes it. He's like, "All right. You got to be pretty good at aiming this."
-SAM-
Yeah, are you?
-MATT-
"It's about 15, 20 feet from here."
-LAURA-
Well, I'm strong.
-MATT-
"But can you aim it?"
-LAURA-
Yeah, but you're weak, aren't you?
-SAM-
I don't know. I feel like I'm more precise than you. But, no, you're strong. You go for it.
-LAURA-
No, but you're precise.
-SAM-
I don't--
-LIAM-
Frumpkin is pacing back and forth just outside the fence.
-SAM-
Parchment, boulder, shears?
-LAURA-
Yeah. On three?
-SAM-
Yes, on three. One. Two. Three! Okay, you're throwing it.
-LAURA-
Okay, I'll throw it.
-MATT-
So go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier.
-SAM-
Ooh, strength.
-LAURA-
Oh, that was good, okay.
11. No! 12.
-MATT-
You throw it. Tink, tink.
-LAURA-
Thunder, thunder! When I did it.
-MATT-
Okay. There's this roll of thunder off in the distance. It didn't catch anything, though, and it's scraping. Pulling back a little bit--
-LAURA-
More thunder. Another thunder.
-SAM-
It's not staying on?
-MATT-
It didn't manage to. It got over to the roof, but it didn't catch anything.
-MARISHA-
Oh, god.
-SAM-
Reel it back in. Reel it back in!
-MARISHA-
Don't let it get caught.
-LAURA-
I do another thunder sound right when I pull it, so it doesn't make noise.
-MATT-
Okay. So you pull it and it scrapes, falls, and then dangles down. You manage to pull it up a little bit, dangle it up, yeah.
-SAM-
Give me that. Give me that!
-LAURA-
Here! It is a strength thing, though.
-SAM-
(squeaks)
-MATT-
Are you just throwing it?
-SAM-
Yes. Natural one.
(laughter)
-MATT-
All right. So.
-SAM-
We've lost our grapple.
-LAURA-
No. No, Ulog was holding onto the end of it.
-MATT-
He was holding the other side of it. The grapple arcs up really high, and arcs past.
There's a brief moment where you see it go up, and then pass by you, heading down towards the wall.
Is anyone going to do anything?
-LAURA-
I catch-- I try to catch the rope to try to keep it from hitting the ground.
-MATT-
You could try.
-SAM-
Oh boy. Try!
-LAURA-
I'll try.
-MARISHA-
I don't know what to do!
-LAURA-
I did; I tried!
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll.
-MARISHA-
Is it flying out of our grasp; is that what’s happening?
-MATT-
It looks like it’s just out of the grasp.
She's going to try, so go ahead and roll a d20.
-MARISHA-
She's going to try and catch it.
-LAURA-
I rolled a 19. I don't know what I'm adding.
-MATT-
Yeah. That's fine. So you manage to just catch it, holding onto the edge of the rope, before it clanks onto the ground. It's just dangling now.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
You pull it slowly back up.
-MARISHA-
Wait.
-SAM-
You said strength. I threw it as hard as I could throw it.
-MARISHA-
Quiet, shut up!
-SAM-
Thunder!
-MARISHA-
(whispers) Okay, maybe if I get over, I could hold the other end and help people.
-LAURA-
You can jump ten feet?
-MARISHA-
I think I can.
-LAURA-
Oh, dear lord. What if you fall on the ground, Beau?
-TRAVIS-
Let this happen. Let this happen.
-MARISHA-
Look, we're basically gods, okay? (laughter)
I can make this jump.
-MATT-
You going to try?
-MARISHA-
I'm going to cast step of the wind-- Sorry, not cast it. I'm going to use a ki point.
I'm going to take a breath, gather my chi. Along the edge of the branch anime run--
-MATT-
Okay. And leap. Make an athletics check.
I'll give you advantage because of the step of the wind.
-MARISHA-
Step of the wind gives me, like, double jump distance, or triple jump--dump jist--
-SAM-
Triple dump!
-TRAVIS-
Triple dungeness crabs.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, we had ring of truth cast. You can't lie.
-SAM-
Taliesin did a triple dump earlier.
-TALIESIN-
I did. Solid.
-MARISHA-
Hang on.
-MATT-
Your jump distance is doubled! Yeah, you're fine.
-MARISHA-
(victorious laughter)
-MATT-
You're fine.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Just roll for the hell of it. I just want to see what happens.
-LAURA-
Just so it's not a one. No ones!
-SAM-
It won't be a one.
-MARISHA-
I don't trust Gil right now. I'm not going to trust Gil.
I'm going to go with cobalt die.
Natural 18.
-MATT-
You, off the branch, leap. No sound.
-MARISHA-
I go along the rope, and tighten the rope as I land.
-LAURA-
The rope's not-- Oh, were you holding onto the grapple?
-TALIESIN-
She's got the other end.
-MARISHA-
I was, like, tracing the rope.
-MATT-
You grab it, affix it easily to one of the smokestacks you find up there.
-LIAM-
She is really cool.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
She's amazing.
-LAURA-
Great. So we'll tie off the other side-- Yeah.
-MATT-
Ulog takes it and ties the other side of the rope. You guys can all begin to shimmy across and make your way.
-LAURA-
(whispers) We shimmy.
-MATT-
So. The rope is set up. Are you guys just going to shimmy across?
-SAM-
Sure.
-MARISHA-
When do we do the cat?
-SAM-
Oh wait, do we have to cast-- Do we have to have a-- Distraction!
-MARISHA-
The cat.
-SAM-
Oh, we're going to shimmy across. Because what if the guard looks up and sees us?
-LIAM-
Only, Frumpkin is down at the bottom of the tree. He runs around and--
-SAM-
So we do that now!
-LIAM-
Yeah. I think--
-LAURA-
Well, we do that--
-SAM-
Now!
-LAURA-
When we lower into the cellar, right when--
-SAM-
No, we're going through the roof now, I thought. No?
-LAURA-
Well how--?
-LIAM-
Wait, hold on. Is there entry through the roof?
-MATT-
You're not there. You can't see it from here.
-LIAM-
We can't see from here?
-MARISHA-
There is a chimney stack, though, right?
-LIAM-
A chimney stack? We're not Santa Claus!
-TRAVIS-
We are now.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Is there a door on the roof? How would there be a stupid door on the roof?
-SAM-
There could be.
-TALIESIN-
Sometimes there's balconies.
-LAURA-
There's no balconies.
-MATT-
There's no balconies on this house.
-SAM-
Look around for a door on the roof!
-MARISHA-
What? Who would have a door on the roof?
-SAM-
Rich people.
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-MARISHA-
I look around. Is there a door on the roof?
-LAURA-
Maybe like an attic access or something?
-TALIESIN-
French roof.
-MARISHA-
18.
-MATT-
18? You don't find an entry way per se. One of the chimneys is wide enough for someone to pass through. It looks like there is a part of the roof that, if you were to try and remove some of the shingles, there might be some sort of entrance below it.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
You're on an angle there, on each side.
-MARISHA-
It looks like they need to re-roof. Like they haven't done it in about 15 years. Right?
-SAM-
Sure.
-MARISHA-
So maybe we could get in. Or, go through the cellar. Or, be like Santa Claus.
-LAURA-
I think we should go in through the roof.
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's shimmy across. Make the distraction now.
-LAURA-
We already shimmied.
-SAM-
No we didn't!
-MARISHA-
It's happening now. It's real time. Real time! I think.
-LIAM-
I'm sending Frumpkin now, okay?
-SAM-
Go. Sausage cat!
-MATT-
You watch as Frumpkin runs past (cat yowling) outside of the gate. Immediately (dog barking). He's like, "No!" (guard stuttering) The dog drags him to the opposite side, like around the outside, into the fence and is now trying to bite. And Frumpkin's on the other side of the fence, going (meows and hisses). (barking), right into the fence. The guy's still holding back, like "Shit, no, stop! God, stop it!" Is pulling. You guys all make it across--no one seems to notice, none the wiser--onto the roof.
-LAURA-
Hey, Nott. Send a message to Fjord and say, "Hey, did we look cool, just then?"
-SAM-
Okay, I take out my little piece of wire and I whisper the incantation and do the motions.
Hey, Fjord, Jester wants to know: Did we look cool? You can respond to this message.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Did they go already?
-SAM-
He said, "Did they go already?" (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I heard a dog barking. I feel that this plan was no better than ours.
-MATT-
You guys are watching; you guys are on--?
-TALIESIN-
We’re keeping an eye on the street.
-MATT-
Perception check from both you guys.
-LIAM-
Where are they in relation to us too, by the way?
-MATT-
That's up to them.
-TALIESIN-
I think we're on a corner, like far enough away from the house not to be a problem.
-LIAM-
I want to know if you're within view of the guard with the dog's initial position.
-TRAVIS-
16.
-TALIESIN-
21.
-MATT-
Okay. Keeping an eye out there, there isn't any, at the moment, notable individuals wandering towards, or snooping around the house or your position. So you feel pretty safe.
-TALIESIN-
You look like a guard.
-TRAVIS-
Not yet. I should. Yeah, I'll wander into an alley.
-MATT-
And change into a crownsguard? Okay. Got it.
-TALIESIN-
I got my cards out.
-MATT-
You guys, you are on the roof.
-MARISHA-
There was a guard named Cloen, who was the guard who saw the spider.
-MATT-
There are two chimneys.
-MARISHA-
Just throwing that out there.
-MATT-
There is the slight roof thing that you saw.
-LIAM-
So what I would do is also, once we're in position on the roof, is I would tell Frumpkin to back off away from that dog, out of vision, and wait a few minutes, because he's within a hundred feet of me. If so, we're good. Tell him to find Molly, and sit with Molly. He'll always listen to me, but I'm also sending him the command to listen to Molly, if need be.
-MATT-
Easy enough to do. All right. So.
-LIAM-
You don't know that. But, still.
-MATT-
The barking slows. The dog is still barking in the direction of what was there, and seems to be still really entranced with the possibility of getting that fucking cat. Frumpkin does find his way to you, Molly. Guys on the roof, what are you doing?
-MARISHA-
Got to get through this roof.
-LIAM-
What were you saying? I did not hear you.
-LAURA-
Pry at the shingles. Look at how deep these go.
-SAM-
I'm going to go down the chimney.
-LIAM-
Yeah, good, we covered-- If we do the shingles, how do we cover them up when we leave? We're trying to leave no trace.
-LAURA-
Who gives a shit? Who's going to be on the fucking roof?
-MARISHA-
I step around. How do the shingles feel?
-MATT-
Some of them loosen and slip a little bit, and you can see there's a very, very faint groove on the wood beneath it. Like a gap.
-LAURA-
Not everyone can fit through the chimney.
-MARISHA-
Nott!
-SAM-
What?
-MARISHA-
Do you have a dagger?
-SAM-
I have a shortsword.
-MARISHA-
Can I borrow it?
-LIAM-
I have a dagger.
-MARISHA-
Can I borrow any bladed thing? Thank you.
-SAM-
I don't like to lend my items out.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to jack it up and see if I can--
-LAURA-
I cast thunder. Thaumaturgy.
-MATT-
Okay. (thunder rumbling) off in the distance. As you begin to pry a little bit, it begins to move up. There is some sort of a hatch.
-MARISHA-
Does it feel like a trap door?
-MATT-
It feels like a trap door a little bit.
-MARISHA-
Oh, my god.
-MATT-
As it's pulling up, the shingles that are overlapped on it are overlapping the gap and start sliding a little bit. You immediately feel like if you open this, you're going to send a bunch of shingles sliding off of the roof.
-LIAM-
No, get them. Get them.
-SAM-
Let's go down the chimney. At least I can go down there and look to see if it's possible.
-MATT-
There is a very faint trail of smoke coming out of the chimney, by the way.
-LAURA-
There's a fire in there. What if we pull up these shingles?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, pull up the shingles.
-LAURA-
And, like, stack them.
-MATT-
So you begin to collect them. Where are you putting them?
-SAM-
In the haversack!
-MATT-
Okay. So you take a moment to go ahead and carefully-- You have a collection now of roughly 23 roof shingles in your haversack.
-MARISHA-
Those could be valuable.
-MATT-
So you can add that to your equipment.
-MARISHA-
Are they clay shingles? Very valuable.
-LIAM-
Look out, giant red dragons.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MATT-
We'll say it takes you about five minutes or so to finally get all those off carefully. You manage to pry it open, and it opens up ever so slightly, and there's a chain on each end that prevent it from (slamming open). It opens up just enough that you can slip inside, and there is a small ladder there that you can use to slowly get down into a small attic.
-LAURA-
I'll hold it open if you guys go scout.
-MARISHA-
Okay. Do you want to let them know that we're going in?
-SAM-
Yes. I pull out my thing, and I do my thing.
-MARISHA-
Then Beau will go down first.
-SAM-
We're going in, to the house. You can respond to this message.
They're dead.
-LIAM-
I drop in after Beauregard and I cast Detect Magic immediately.
-MATT-
Okay. You cast Detect Magic.
-LIAM-
30 feet.
-TRAVIS-
They're going in the house.
-MATT-
Right, 30 feet in the vicinity.
-MARISHA-
I do the cool thing where, like, I slide down, like a fireman, down the ladder a little bit.
-MATT-
Okay. It only goes down about five feet or so. It's a very small crawl space.
-MARISHA-
Well, I look real cool for five feet.
-MATT-
You do. It's a very small crawl space. It's maybe, like, ten foot by five foot. It's very dusty in here. It looks like there are a few clay pots. There looks to be a portrait, like some sort of a large art piece, that's leaning against the wall and has some cobwebs over it. Other than that, it looks fairly empty, like it hasn't been used fully. You, casting Detect Magic. Let me check real fast.
Yeah. So you look around the vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace.
-SAM-
Are there any other doors in this crawl space that lead into the main?
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-SAM-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
You do find, there is another trapdoor on the opposite end of the crawl space that is partially blocked by the art piece that's leaning against it. You shift it out of the way and unhinge the top, and it opens and drops down to a hallway that has like faint a crackling firelight inside this hallway. You glance down inside. You can see a long hallway with tapestries on each wall of a beautiful writing. There are two ornamental armor sets that are set up on the side.
You can see an ornamental sword that is bolted on the wall on the opposite end and stairs not too far from where you are that head further down into the building, and there is a doorway that leads to the right on the opposite end of the hallway.
-MARISHA-
Jester, can you go ahead and cast a spell?
-LAURA-
What spell?
-MARISHA-
The locate-the-thing spell.
-LAURA-
I am distracted by looking at this beautiful piece of art.
-SAM-
Do you want to draw a mustache on it, or something? A dick butt?
-LAURA-
I think I studied this artist back at home.
-LIAM-
You know, we want to be efficient here.
Quick.
-LAURA-
Oh, okay. It only last for ten minutes though when I do it. So if we don't find it soon then--
-LIAM-
Yes, save more time to doing so. Let's start moving. And you’re looking for bad physical things.
-LAURA-
I'm going to--
-SAM-
Traps?
Oh, God! Yes! Oh, God! I forgot to look for any traps!
-ALL-
Shh!
-SAM-
Sorry. I going to take a big drink.
-LAURA-
I'm sure Ulog can look for traps, because he's also a rogue, right?
-MATT-
He is, but he is behind you guys at this point.
-LAURA-
Ulog, help us. Please.
-MATT-
"All right. The two of us will keep an eye for traps." He's giving you an advantage. He's giving you the help actually. You were down to casting what spell? You were casting--
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast Locate Object. Cast spell. I'm going to search for a wax seal.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
What's the light situation like in here?
-MATT-
You go down and there are two torches that are burning in the edge, but they don't have a fuel source. They are an ever-burning torch and they are both fixed to the wall, giving this flickering light in the vicinity. You’ve come down to the hallway?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
LEDs, yeah.
-MATT-
So you guys have made your way down into the hallway. You’re still concentrating the spell, right?
-LIAM-
Hells yes.
-MATT-
There are magical auras emulating from these torches. They're both everlight. You've seen this magic before. They just continuously burn. It’s continual flame. You also get a faint magical aura from each of the suits of armor, and a faint magical aura from the sword across the way on the opposite wall.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Like traps? Or they are just--
-SAM-
I'm going to look for traps.
-MATT-
Go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage.
-MARISHA-
Oh, fuck.
-LIAM-
Do I know the school of magic?
-SAM-
20.
-MATT-
What'd you roll? A 20?
-SAM-
20.
-MATT-
20. You carefully go forward and both you and Ulog pay attention. The floorboards of this hallway progress one after another, and there's a cluster about four of them, about a-foot-and-a-half across each of them, that are slightly lifted on one side. Glancing forward, you can see there’s some sort of pressure device that triggers when those boards are stepped on.
-LIAM-
There's no magical aura from those at all? Those are separate. You're not saying.
-MATT-
You're not sure.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-SAM-
Ulog, you didn't find anything. I found a trap.
-MATT-
"Actually-- fine."
-LIAM-
The spell says I know the school of magic for what's on these things. You able to tell me that?
-MATT-
Correct. I would say-- That's an interesting question.
-SAM-
Necromancy.
-MATT-
Let me check something real fast.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
There's undead bodies in the armor!
-MATT-
We'll say it can go in two different ways.
I'm not entirely sure.
-LIAM-
If you don’t know how to answer, it's fine.
-MATT-
No, no. I do here. It would be--
-LIAM-
(singing) Breaking the law. Breaking the law.
-MARISHA-
Breaking the law.
-MATT-
We'll say conjuration.
-LIAM-
Okay. <i>Ja.</i>
-MATT-
No, transmutation, which you know well.
-SAM-
Edubation.
-LIAM-
I'm an expert in edubation.
That's Liam, not Caleb.
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hm.
I have a very bad feeling about these suits of armor.
-LAURA-
So we won't touch them.
-MARISHA-
That was him. That was him. I did not say that.
-SAM-
Let's jump over this little hump.
-LIAM-
Okay, but I don't know exactly how these work, but I have a strong suspicion that these things can start moving and try to cut us up. Both these suits of armor and that weapon.
-LAURA-
Are those traps would set them off?
-LIAM-
Maybe.
-MATT-
Jester. As you finish concentrating on the spell and focusing on the wax seal, you get a blip of its location in the next chamber beyond where you are in the door on the right.
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh! How great because we came in--
-SAM-
Let's go!
-LAURA-
We have to avoid the traps.
-SAM-
Jump over that little hump.
-LIAM-
Hopefully things will go very well, but there's a chance that this thing that you are indicating is not connected to those, so be ready to fight.
-LAURA-
So duck down. It's like The Neverending Story. Don't be afraid, you guys, just go!
-SAM-
Wait, what if-- we are up shit's creek. So we need Schmidt's creek. What if you have Schmidt do something? Can Schmidt go do something?
-MATT-
As this is happening, Ulog is sighing loudly, pulls out some tools, and begins to fiddle with where the boards are on the ground. He manages to get a shortsword of his pressed underneath where the boards are and slips it across, slightly lifting each one as he goes until the sword peeks out the opposite side acting as a platform beneath.
-MARISHA-
Dope! Yeah!
-SAM-
I told him to do that, I sort of-- He goes, "Watch and learn, little one."
-LAURA-
It's like a training session.
-MATT-
He goes and carefully steps on the boards, and then steps across with no effect.
-SAM-
Is he mansplaining to me?
-MATT-
Roguesplaining, technically.
-LIAM-
This. Is. Exciting.
-LAURA-
Come on this only lasts ten minutes let's go!
-MARISHA-
Someone stay watch. We're going to go this way.
-SAM-
We're making progress! You can respond to this message.
-TRAVIS-
I'm over here.
-SAM-
We're making progress! (laughter)
-MATT-
As you guys head in, there's the closed door that leads into the chamber where you're sensing this aura.
-LAURA-
Okay. Detect for traps. Look for traps on this door.
-SAM-
Me? Okay. I'm gonna look for traps. Eight, plus five. 13.
-MATT-
13, okay. It is trapped.
-SAM-
Oh! It's a door? That's trapped?
-MATT-
Yes. It's not locked, but it is trapped.
-MARISHA-
Do I hear any movement in the house?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LAURA-
How do we disarm a trap?
-MARISHA-
Not bad, not bad.
-SAM-
We let Ulog do it!
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
15. You listen out. You do not hear any movement in the house other than what you currently are making.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
(hiccups)
-MATT-
And a hiccup from out in the distance.
-TALIESIN-
Hello, pick a card.
-MATT-
Perception check from both of you guys, by the way, while this is happening.
-TRAVIS-
11.
-TALIESIN-
11.
-MATT-
Okay. You don't seem to notice anything. All right. So you guys--
-SAM-
I'm going to try to disarm it.
-MATT-
All right. You pull out your thieves'--
-SAM-
Do I see the triggering mechanism?
-MATT-
We'll find out! Go ahead and make a thieves' tools check. So roll a d20, add your proficiency modifier and your dexterity modifier. Should be plus six, I think?
-SAM-
Yes, 16.
-MATT-
16! As you carefully get down to where the knob is, you begin to turn it ever so slightly and you hear this spring begin to tighten, and you're familiar with that sound. So you manage to get your tool underneath, and you find where the spring is, it's barely in the space between where the door and the edge of the door frame is. You get the tool underneath, capture it, and as you pull the door open it prevents the spring from pulling back into the device. You slowly, as you expose it, reach in, snap the opposing side and remove the spring entirely, leaving the trap inert.
-SAM-
These are your tools, Beau!
-LIAM-
I wish I was still a rogue, it's the best class!
-SAM-
I feel so alive!
-MATT-
As the door opens into a fairly well-decorated master bedroom. You see a large canopy bed, a beautiful detailed embroidered rug that consumes the center of the floor. You can see a fireplace to your right, the one that you saw that was attached to the top of the roof, that has a fire burning in it. It has two giant statues of lions on each side, this cool detailed shelf there. You can see a table with chairs to your left. You can see a slight opening to a balcony that's not visible from the outside.
-SAM-
Ooh, an invisible balcony.
-LIAM-
I walk up behind Nott and scan the room with the spell.
-MATT-
Okay. You're just scanning the room?
-LIAM-
I'm just walking up behind Nott, no further, and looking in to see what glows.
-MATT-
All right. As you glance in and look, there is immediately to your left a large metal cabinet of some kind. It is made of dark iron, and gives a very faint magical aura to it. The rug in the center of the room gives a faint magical aura as well.
-SAM-
The rug?
-LAURA-
Flying carpet!
-TALIESIN-
No.
-LAURA-
Look for traps in the room.
-SAM-
Okay. Did you see the lock I just--
-TRAVIS-
Fuckin' focus!
-LAURA-
I did, but hurry!
-SAM-
19.
-MATT-
You're looking for--
-SAM-
Traps.
-MATT-
Okay, investigation check. You glance around and look in the chamber. You don't see anything that gives the essence of a trap to you. It looks like the trap was part of the entry here, but there's nothing immediately in the vicinity that resembles a triggering trap.
-LIAM-
What kind of magic is emanating from the carpet? What school of magic?
-MATT-
The carpet? It's also transmutation, and the magic on the large case has a faint abjuration.
-LAURA-
Where is the glow for the seal is coming from?
-MATT-
It's underneath the rug.
-LIAM-
I alert everyone. The carpet is magical.
-SAM-
We should not step on it.
-LAURA-
Well, I need to move it because the seal is under the rug.
-MARISHA-
The seal's under the rug?
-SAM-
Do we have anything that can negate the magic or--
-MARISHA-
Do you have Dispel Magic?
-LIAM-
I do not.
-SAM-
Can Schmidt stand on the carpet? Oh! I can move it with my Mage Hand or something, or peel it back with my mage hand.
-MATT-
Mage Hand. Very helpful when setting grappling hooks on roofs.
-SAM-
Oh, shit! Shut up, Ulog!
-MATT-
"I'm just saying, if I knew you could do that, you could've--"
-SAM-
Fuck you, I know what I'm doing.
-LAURA-
So move the fucking carpet!
-SAM-
You want me to move the carpet?
-LAURA-
Move the rug.
-MARISHA-
Can I do a look for anything that looks out of place, any papers, anything, trap doors?
-MATT-
Investigation check.
-LIAM-
I have a question. The carpet reeks of abjuration, or-- I would know that the carpet is magical.
-SAM-
It was transmutation.
-LIAM-
Transmutation. If the carpet is magical, I wouldn't--
-MATT-
You can only see magical sources from what you can see. So if a thing's behind a wall or behind an object you don't see an aura.
-LIAM-
Right. The carpet seems magical to me, I wouldn't think that something under the carpet is magical.
-TRAVIS-
Yep, I saw it.
-MARISHA-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
Natural 20! As they're having this conversation, you glance by the fireplace, the fire is crackling in there, and you glance down and right underneath the hearth, up where the fire's tickling, you see a piece of the stonework that doesn't match the others, it's slightly off-colored. It looks like the burning of the fire that's been given this dark and blackened look to it, there's one brick there that doesn't seem to have been affected by any of the soot at all.
-MARISHA-
I, avoiding the rug, lightly step over it, and see if I can jiggy the brick out.
-MATT-
As your finger presses against the brick it slides in about a half an inch, and you hear this (click) sound over by where the metal large cabinet is.
-LAURA-
You just unlocked the fucking metal shit!
-MARISHA-
Oh shit!
-LIAM-
Do I see any change in the abjuration magic when she does that?
-MATT-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
Does it go away?
-MATT-
It vanishes.
(cheering)
-SAM-
I'm going to cast Message. We are the fucking best! You can respond to this message! (laughter)
-LAURA-
I got to get that seal!
-LIAM-
What you just did dispelled whatever ward was on the cabinet, however the carpet I can't tell exactly what's going on but there is something--
-LAURA-
Use the Mage Hand to move the carpet.
-MARISHA-
Give me the papers.
-SAM-
I cast Mage Hand and slowly peel back a corner of the carpet.
-LAURA-
I hand the two letters that we made for Lord Sutan.
-MATT-
Okay, the carpet peels back and it reveals beneath it a section of the wood that has a hinge bolted to one side of it. It's a square that's cut out of it, it looks like it's an open case. The carpet peels back, and then begins to fold back in its space, and then fold up again. It begins to slightly shift and rise, and the carpet almost seems to be gliding in the air on its own in the vicinity. It spins towards you and then <i>rushes</i> in your direction. I need everyone to roll initiative.
-MARISHA-
We're fighting a carpet! The fuck!
-LAURA-
We're fighting a carpet.
-TALIESIN-
We had it coming.
-LIAM-
It's an animated object!
-TRAVIS-
I had that in my one-shot.
-LIAM-
My kids have fought a broom. This happens.
-LAURA-
Whoa, look at that carpet!
-MATT-
That carpet is now gone, because instead you are fighting <i>that</i> carpet.
(cheering)
-TRAVIS-
It's like a cobra ready to strike!
-MATT-
All righty, so Nott would've been over here.
-LAURA-
So we're rolling initiative, that's what we're doing?
-MATT-
Yes, roll initiative, please. Beau, you're over by the fireplace so you've just seen that happen there, and I think that's--
-LIAM-
I would be by Beau because I clapped her on the shoulder.
-MATT-
Right, right.
-SAM-
Yeah, Holly.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I forgot my dwarf mini.
-SAM-
Oh no!
-MATT-
Well, no, it's in here somewhere. Forgot to bring it out. I am unprepared!
-TRAVIS-
Unprepared. Just use a d4.
-LIAM-
(sarcastically) You are not prepared, oh no.
-MATT-
That's fine, I'll use this. I'll say that that's him there, it's fine. Given that case, guys, first it's a surprise round, as it whips its way over towards Nott.
-SAM-
<i>It</i> gets a surprise round.
-MATT-
It does, because it suddenly rushes in your direction. That is going to be a 21 to hit.
-SAM-
That hits.
-MATT-
Natural 16. It goes and wraps around you and completely envelops you within itself. All of a sudden you just see darkness, and you cannot breathe.
-MARISHA-
Oh, this is going to suck.
-MATT-
Currently you are enveloped by the Rug of Smothering.
-MARISHA-
The Rug of Smothering.
-MATT-
Initiative here. Top of the round, 25 to 20 anybody.
-SAM-
24.
-MATT-
24, that'll be you first, Nott. 20 to 15?
-LAURA-
17.
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
Beau. 15 to 10?
-TALIESIN-
15.
-MATT-
What'd you get Caleb?
-LIAM-
Well you know, I rolled a nine.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god!
-TRAVIS-
I’m not in this one, fucker. You guys are the best, that's the last we heard.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
(singing) You're the best around! Nothing's ever going to bring you down!
-MATT-
It's true! Nott, it's your turn first. You are restrained, you are blinded, and you are suffocating. At the start of your turn, you immediately take 12 points of bludgeoning damage as it's now crushing and constricting your entire body. You feel the life being pulled out of you as you're gasping for breath in this space. What are you going to do with your turn?
-SAM-
A VS spell is verbal. Can I talk?
-MATT-
Yes, you can still talk. You're (muffled sounds). You still have the breath you had in your body when it went around you, so I'll say you have enough air for one spell and then that's all.
-SAM-
Okay. I will touch it with Shocking Grasp, cast Shocking Grasp on it.
-MATT-
Is that a spell attack roll?
-SAM-
It's touch, to hit plus five. So I have to roll.
-MATT-
Yeah, you would have disadvantage because you're restrained, but it's also smothering you so I would give you advantage to that, so it's just a straight roll.
-SAM-
13 plus five. 18!
-MATT-
That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.
-SAM-
Okay. One point of damage. However, it can't take reactions until its next turn.
-MATT-
Good to know.
-SAM-
Does it let me go?
-MATT-
Nope!
-SAM-
I can't move away from it?
-MATT-
No, you are restrained. You can try and break free, but it's an action to try.
-SAM-
Oh shit. Well, poo.
-MATT-
But hey, there you go. Jester, you're up.
-LAURA-
Okay, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on it.
-MATT-
Okay. You see it wrapping around and Nott's flailing about as this carpet is crushing her little body. Go ahead and--
-LAURA-
Roll a ranged attack.
-MATT-
Yes. Go for it.
-LAURA-
Oh! Natural 19.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
-LAURA-
That's 4d6. Radiant.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, get it!
-SAM-
Damn!
-LAURA-
15 damage, and the next attack has advantage against it.
-MATT-
Okay, it takes eight points of radiant damage, and Nott takes seven points of radiant damage.
-LAURA-
(gasping) Oh no!
-MATT-
As you blast you hear Nott (muffled screaming) underneath, you get the sense all the damage dealt to this rug is divided with whoever it's enveloping.
-LAURA-
Oh no, I'm sorry, Nott!
-SAM-
I can't hear you.
-TRAVIS-
He doesn't know who's doing it, that's okay.
-MATT-
Jester, you going to stay where you are?
-LAURA-
Where am I?
-MATT-
Sorry, you would've been probably over here.
-LAURA-
Oh no, how do we get it off?
-LIAM-
We damage it.
-LAURA-
No, but we can't damage it.
-MATT-
You going to move or stay here?
-LIAM-
No, I understand, but we damage it.
-LAURA-
I'm going to go stand on the bed!
-MATT-
You move around and stand on the bed!
-SAM-
And jump!
-MATT-
All righty. That ends your turn Jester.
Beau, you're up.
-MARISHA-
All right. I'm going to run up with my staff and do a crack crack.
-LAURA-
No, but--
-MARISHA-
Let me do my fucking thing, man. Let me do my fucking thing.
-TRAVIS-
She doesn't know.
-MARISHA-
I have no fucking clue.
-TRAVIS-
Same six seconds!
-LAURA-
No, but you just heard Nott scream!
-LIAM-
No one knows, who the fuck knows?
-MARISHA-
Sorry, Nott. Crack!
-SAM-
(screaming) I'm hurting! You can reply to this message!
-MARISHA-
16 for the first one.
-MATT-
That hits. Roll damage.
-MARISHA-
Okay, that is six damage.
-MATT-
That's three to you, Nott.
-SAM-
I'm unconscious.
-TRAVIS-
Are you?
-SAM-
Uh-huh.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit. Fuck.
-MARISHA-
For the second one.
-LAURA-
Oh no, you're going to kill Nott!
-MARISHA-
That hits. That's a natural 16. And that's seven damage.
-MATT-
Seven damage. That's four damage to the thing and you fail a death saving throw.
-MARISHA-
Now I'm going to spend a ki point.
-TRAVIS-
Doesn't she fail two?
-MATT-
No, that's on a critical. She wasn't attacking Nott specifically. She was attacking the rug.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to spend a ki point and do something that I have yet to do, which is Extract Aspects.
-SAM-
What does that mean?
-TRAVIS-
It can't have that many hit points, right?
-MATT-
Okay. So you hit it twice.
-MARISHA-
Then I'm going to see if I can catch any reverberations off of the rug.
-MATT-
All right. And it makes a what saving throw? Constitution?
-MARISHA-
Constitution.
-MATT-
That is an 11.
-MARISHA-
Fail!
-MATT-
All right. What do you want to know about it?
-MARISHA-
I want to know its damage vulnerabilities. What's it vulnerable to?
-MATT-
It is actually not vulnerable to anything.
-MARISHA-
What?! Do I get something else?
-MATT-
You learned it is not vulnerable to anything.
-LIAM-
You learned it's badass.
-TRAVIS-
Goddamn it.
-LAURA-
We have to try to pull the rug off of-- We have to out-strength the rug!
-LIAM-
Next. Moving on.
-MARISHA-
Hey guys, Nott's in the rug.
-SAM-
(muffled screaming)
-MATT-
Now it's Ulog's turn. Ulog, who sees the rug there, is going to rush over and attempt to--
-LIAM-
Oh, Ulog is a little girl.
-MATT-
I know. It was the best I could find in the moment, you know?
-TRAVIS-
It works.
-MATT-
It's fine. He rolls a two, because NPCs that I try and fight with can't roll shit. That misses.
That misses. To your benefit, Ulog tries to stab and is missing or hitting the edge of the tassels.
It's not even making an impact on the rug. He is going to use a bonus action to disengage and head back towards where the balcony is. All right. So that goes ahead and ends that. That brings us to the rug's turn. The rug is going to go ahead and release Nott, and is going to attempt to completely envelop Beau.
-MARISHA-
Hey guys, Nott's down-- Oh shit.
-MATT-
That's cocked. That is another 16. 21.
-MARISHA-
Hits.
-LAURA-
Oh, no.
-MATT-
You, Beau, are now enveloped by the rug.
-MARISHA-
Hey guys, I think this rug (choking).
-LAURA-
How do we defeat this rug before it kills all of us?
-MATT-
All righty. That's going to go ahead and end the rug's turn.
-TRAVIS-
How'd you guys die? A rug.
-TALIESIN-
Rugs are the new doors.
-MATT-
Actually, the rug's going to go ahead, because it can still move-- Well, it's speed is nothing, nevermind.
-TRAVIS-
What? It moves into the fireplace?
-MATT-
Well it would move her away. No, it's not going to do that.
-TRAVIS-
(screams)
-MATT-
It doesn't have enough movement to move much. That brings us to the bottom. Caleb, you're up.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I pull the potion of healing I have out of my belt, and I run over to Nott and I jam it into her mouth and pour it in. The whole time I'm going through my list of spells thinking of what could help. There's nothing, but I'm going: Dancing Lights, Fire Bolt, Friends, Alarm, Burning Hands, Chromatic Orb, Comprehend Languages, Detect Magic. And I heal Nott.
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll for the heal on that.
-MARISHA-
And before I got wrapped up I said it's not immune to any-- (choking) It has no weaknesses-- (choking)
-MATT-
All righty. So how much does Nott heal?
-LIAM-
14 points.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa!
-SAM-
From one healing potion?
-LIAM-
Greater.
-MATT-
There you go. Top of the round. Nott, your turn. As you come to consciousness, you are still prone.
-TRAVIS-
Return that damage.
-MATT-
Caleb moved around to join your side there to go ahead and apply the potion.
-SAM-
We can't hurt Beau!
-MARISHA-
No, it's fine.
-SAM-
I will go and try to wrestle the--
-TRAVIS-
You're a god!
-MARISHA-
(choking)
-MATT-
You know what, go ahead and make an athletics check.
-SAM-
Two.
-MATT-
No. You rush up and you grab it, and it actually lifts you off your feet and you are now being flailed in the air as you're grabbing the edge of the rug, going (screams).
-SAM-
(screaming)
-MATT-
All right that ends your turn. Jester, you're up.
-LAURA-
I'm going to try to go help Nott and I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to try to pry the rug off of Beau.
-MATT-
Okay. You move up. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
-MARISHA-
This is the best!
-TALIESIN-
That's a number.
-LAURA-
That's a number. It's a 12.
-MATT-
12. You grab and you're not pulled off your feet, but the rug is too strong and it's not quite releasing its hold on Beau. Beau, it's your turn.
At the top of your turn, you suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!
-MATT-
As it's crushing your body on the inside and you cannot breathe. It is your turn, though. You can still go.
-LIAM-
He's killing our nostalgia for the carpet.
-LAURA-
I wonder if there's something in the room that will--
-SAM-
Turn it off?
-LAURA-
Turn it off.
-LIAM-
He would have had to have told me that there was magic anywhere else in the room.
-LAURA-
No, because the thing in the fireplace.
-LIAM-
Right, was physical. That's true.
-MATT-
What are you doing, Beau?
-MARISHA-
Can I do any type of attack? What can I do?
-MATT-
Yeah, you just have disadvantage on the attacks.
-MARISHA-
I just have disadvantage.
-LIAM-
Come on, you are a badass. You can do it.
-TRAVIS-
Roll that fucking shit.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I'm going to try and elbow the fucking shit out this rug.
-LIAM-
You're the best of all of us.
-MARISHA-
I am the best!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, fuck.
-MARISHA-
Fuck you, Gil.
-TRAVIS-
Terrible, just awful.
-MARISHA-
11.
-LIAM-
Wait, did you roll a 20 and an eight?
-MARISHA-
No, I rolled my damage die.
-MATT-
So it was an 11?
-MARISHA-
For the first one.
-MATT-
Misses.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh. Second one.
-LIAM-
Come on, Beau.
-MARISHA-
No! It's a two.
-MATT-
It's just too tight. You can't quite get any movement to hit it. It's a bad space for you.
-MARISHA-
Oh wait, you said-- oh, disadvantage.
-TRAVIS-
We're the best.
-MATT-
That ends your turn. It is now Ulog's go.
Ulog is going to rush up and attempt to stab at it as he sees it wrapping around there. That is a 12.
That hits.
-TRAVIS-
A 12 hits.
-MATT-
Yeah, I know.
-TRAVIS-
Guys.
-MATT-
It does do sneak attack damage, because you guys are in the vicinity.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what?
-SAM-
He's doing sneak attack damage to the carpet, which translates to you.
-MARISHA-
That's fine.
-MATT-
He doesn't know. He's trying to help. That's going to be 12 points of piercing damage, so six to the rug and six to you.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
-MARISHA-
Ouch.
-MATT-
The rug is starting to look a little torn up in places and you can see bits of Beau showing through where the gashes are stabbing through.
It's looking fairly hurt.
-MARISHA-
Bits of Beau. Bits of Beau are showing.
-LIAM-
Who wore it best?
-MATT-
It's the rug's turn. The rug is going to attempt to shift itself and Beau a little bit away this direction. It can only get five feet because its speed is halved pulling you along with it and its speed is ten. So Nott, you get an attack of opportunity, if you want to take one.
-LAURA-
It's looking weak.
-SAM-
Sure, I'll swing a shortsword at it.
-MATT-
You whip out your shortsword quickly.
-SAM-
21 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack. If you want to sneak attack. You don't have to.
-SAM-
Yeah, sure. If I'm going to hit it, I'm going to hit it. (counting) 15.
-MATT-
15, all right. That's eight to the rug and seven to Beau.
-SAM-
Oh, she's out.
-LIAM-
No, she's not out.
She's hanging on.
-MATT-
The rug is barely holding on by a thread.
You see it still keeps her constrained. You see parts of it are fraying and falling apart. The threads are dangling, but it's still keeping its mass strongly and tightly around her. It's still crushing her and mainly wrapped around her face so she can't see and she can't breathe. That ends the rug's turn. Caleb, you're up.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>.
-MATT-
You're up.
-LIAM-
What am I doing? I rush forward and I am going to try to pry the rug off of her.
-MATT-
Make an athletics check.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>. Come on, roll big. Nope.
Athletics? <i>Nein</i>!
-ALL-
<i>Nein</i>!
-MATT-
There it is. You're trying to pull and you get some threads that snap off and you're like "Shit!" It's not working. You're not getting the right grasp on it.
-LIAM-
Next.
-MATT-
That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.
-SAM-
Me? What about Jes?
-MATT-
No, it's you and then Jester.
-SAM-
Oh, that was a reaction. Well, I guess I see how bad the rug is doing and I will swing that shortsword again. Why not?
-LAURA-
Vengeance.
-SAM-
It's a 15.
-MATT-
Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
If you want to do it with sneak attack, up to you.
-SAM-
You said it was hanging by a thread, right?
-MATT-
It looks like it’s doing pretty rough. It's up to you.
-SAM-
Maybe not sneak attack damage. Ooh, ten points? (laughter)
-MATT-
So that's five damage to Beau and the rug.
-MARISHA-
Guys, this rug is expensi--
-MATT-
You tear through the rug. You cut through and the rug bisects, but you also see that where you cut through also cut across the front of Beau as her eyes roll back and she plops onto the ground, the rug falling in pieces to the ground around her, coming to rest.
-MARISHA-
Don't let me bleed on it!
-SAM-
Ah! What have I done?! Heal her!
-LAURA-
I will. I cast Cure Wounds on her.
-MATT-
Okay, go ahead and cast Cure Wounds to heal.
-LAURA-
Eight points.
-MARISHA-
(gasps) I didn't bleed on it, did I? I move off the rug so I don't bleed on it.
-SAM-
I'm going to cast Message. Remember the hospital? That. You can reply to this message.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
It's going as well as the hospital.
-TALIESIN-
That seems fair.
-LAURA-
He's going to know we were in his room because the rug is messed up.
-SAM-
We'll fix it later.
-LIAM-
That's okay, because if the plan goes according to plan, yeah. Allow myself to introduce myself. If everything goes well, we get Orentha to fall on both of these people at once. So let's finish what we're doing, <i>ja</i>?
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>, doesn't matter. No one is going to care about a rug or him screaming about a rug.
-LAURA-
Okay. Let's gather up the pieces of the rug so it's not, you know.
-MATT-
So you gather all the pieces of the rug to join your shingles.
-MARISHA-
Scoop up the rug.
-LAURA-
Check the fucking thing if it's trapped.
-LIAM-
Check that armoire or whatever it is.
-LAURA-
No, check the thing on the ground and see if it's trapped first.
-LIAM-
Check them both.
-SAM-
I'll check the thing on the ground while Ulog checks the thing on the mantelpiece or wherever it is.
-LIAM-
He's got a safe and a floor.
-SAM-
What am I checking? 14 on the thing on the floor.
-MATT-
It does not appear to be trapped. It does appear to be locked. Roll again.
-LIAM-
No more magic?
-MATT-
Correct.
-SAM-
15 plus thieves' tools.
-MATT-
Yeah, easy enough. (lock clicks) You manage to open it up and there is a small chest about that big that rests in a small cubby beneath.
-MATT-
As you open the chest, make a constitution saving throw.
-SAM-
Oh, shit.
Ten.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Son of a gun.
-MATT-
So first, there's a sudden burst of a brief light through it, and all your muscles tense up and you are paralyzed.
-LIAM-
Motherfucker.
-MARISHA-
Okay. It's okay.
-LIAM-
What about Ulog?
-MARISHA-
What about Ulog?
-LIAM-
Because it's simultaneous.
-MATT-
Ulog goes, "No traps," and pulls it open. No issue.
-LIAM-
What is in there with Ulog?
-MATT-
Inside with Ulog, you see a beautiful set of burgundy and gold robes that are up hanging, you see a set of polished bracers made of cobalt steel that are both dangling on a hook, and you see three ancient statuettes, like relics or collector's items, that are arranged on the bottom of it that all look like old museum pieces.
-MARISHA-
Do they have any symbols on them? On the statues?
-LIAM-
All magical, I assume. I assume they're glowing.
-MATT-
Are you still concentrating?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I haven't cast anything that breaks that.
-MATT-
That's true, you didn't take any damage.
None of them are glowing except for the cobalt bracers.
-MARISHA-
Do I recognize any symbols or see any symbols on the statues?
-MATT-
Make a history check.
-MARISHA-
Ten.
-MATT-
Ten. You do not, unfortunately.
-LIAM-
Nott just collapsed on the floor, paralyzed.
-LAURA-
No, Nott's paralyzed holding onto the chest.
-MATT-
Holding to the chest. The chest which is now open, in Nott's hand.
-LAURA-
I am petting Nott's head and going: Don't worry, in the morning, I can take a spell that will heal you, so we'll carry you out here, okay? Everything will be fine.
-LIAM-
I pull the chest free of Nott's hands. Is this chest glowing?
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
No, it's got the seal in it. Does it have the seal in it?
-MATT-
On the inside there is a faint glow. If you look inside, you see there's a cluster of platinum pieces. They're stacked on the side and have shifted around from the movement. You see a single polished river stone, about that big, that is giving a glowing aura, and you see a few sticks of wax and a single pressed wax seal.
-LAURA-
Okay. I sit down. Oh, do we see his handwriting anywhere? Any letters?
-MATT-
You do not see in this vicinity any letters or handwriting, no.
-MARISHA-
It's okay. He always gets his squires to do his dirty work. But we have the seal.
-LAURA-
Okay. I'll sit down and I'll write a letter really fast that says, "The plan--"
-MARISHA-
He's working with the Myriad, and all that stuff earlier.
-LIAM-
We have that already. We did it in advance.
I start rooting through Nott's pockets to find the letter in Thieves' Cant.
-LAURA-
No, that's different. Those are letters we were leaving here.
-LIAM-
Yeah, Thieves' Cant we're leaving here.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
So we should leave them here.
-MARISHA-
But we wrote up the letters for the High-Richter too, just so we can stamp.
-LAURA-
We didn't actually write that letter yet because I was waiting for his handwriting.
-MARISHA-
Yeah we did because we put the Knights of Requital in it. The KR symbol.
-LAURA-
Sure, why not?
-LIAM-
From Richter to Sutan we did, so we're leaving those, and we're leaving a note--
-MATT-
Marisha, make a perception check. You both make perception checks.
-LIAM-
Nott's fake Myriad note we're leaving here, so I pull that out of Nott's pockets.
-MARISHA-
18.
-MATT-
18? You do glance--
-TALIESIN-
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
17.
-MATT-
Good to know. You glance off to the side and there is a desk in the corner that has two sets of drawers that are currently closed.
-LIAM-
While Jester and Caleb are arguing, Caleb grabs the little magical stone that's in that box and puts it in his pocket.
-MATT-
Okay. You grab it and put it in your pocket.
-MARISHA-
I stuff the letters that we were planting on the High-Richter in the-- sorry, on Sutan into the safe.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Close the safe.
-MATT-
Okay (clicking).
-MARISHA-
Run over to the desk, open the desk, look through it. Do I see anything?
-MATT-
Mostly it's just blank parchment. You do see a few notes that are maybe partially written letters that were crumpled up and thrown in there that are Lord Sutan's handwriting.
-LAURA-
(gasps) Let me see!
-MARISHA-
Yeah, go!
-LAURA-
Okay! I look at it and then I sit down and write the letter and go-- okay, what's her name? The High-Richter's letter's first name?
-TRAVIS-
Prucine.
-MARISHA-
Prucine! Dayana Prucine!
-LAURA-
Dayana, okay. I'm going to write: Dayana, got your message, our plan is moving forward exactly as we discussed. The Myriad has our back!
-MARISHA-
Sure, yeah.
-LAURA-
Sure. Then sign it Lord Sutan.
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-LAURA-
Oh! And something about the Big-O going down.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-LAURA-
The Big-O will go down.
-MARISHA-
Tonight, plan happening, sooner than later.
-MATT-
Okay. Go ahead and roll for your forgery kit. So roll a d20, add your proficiency modifier and your intelligence modifier.
-TALIESIN-
This is hard, being outside.
-MATT-
I'm sorry, guys.
-TALIESIN-
It's okay. Someone had to do it.
-LAURA-
Roll my proficiency plus my intelligence.
Aw, my intelligence?! Why not wisdom? (laughter)
-LIAM-
Got to do it.
-LAURA-
Nine.
-MARISHA-
Is there any way I can help her? Like being also proficient in forging in this background and stuff?
-MATT-
Sure. I'll say since you were helping her that I'll give you advantage on the roll.
-LAURA-
Advantage?
-MATT-
Advantage on the roll. So roll one more time.
-LAURA-
(sighs) Ooh, that's so much better! 22!
-MATT-
You start making one and it's not quite working out and Beau looks over your shoulder, points it out, you take it--
-MARISHA-
Ah, you forgot the hooks on the G's!
-MATT-
You throw it in the fireplace and incinerate that one and then make another one. This one is pretty solid and it matches the writing perfectly.
-LAURA-
This is really good.
-MARISHA-
Wow, yes! It looks amazing. You should be proud.
-LAURA-
I roll it up, heat up the wax, seal it--
-MATT-
(hissing) Done.
-LAURA-
Put the letter in the bag. We have it for later. Then I go and pick up Nott. Let's get out of here.
-MARISHA-
Let's get the <i>fuck</i> out of here.
-LIAM-
We've left the Thieves’ Cant note from the "Myriad" and we've left the-- Yeah? Everything that we've planned?
-LAURA-
Does anyone have any books around?
-MATT-
In the current room? There is a shelf in the hallway that you can see that has a few books.
-LIAM-
Is anything glowing there though, Matthew?
-MATT-
No there's nothing glowing.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I'm going to take out one of the pamphlets for the Traveler and stick it into one of the books.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Okay, and then I pick up Nott!
-MATT-
You guys make your way back up to the entranceway up into the crawlspace above the attic, pull it closed and latch it. You move the art piece back over. You make your way back to the edge of the roof where you guys had exited, climbing the ladder that's attached to it, making your way onto the roof, getting Nott up there, manhandled, Ulog following you as you get to the top. You close it--
-MARISHA-
Put some shingles back.
-MATT-
You put the shingles back in the space. For that, I'm going to have to have you both roll dexterity checks, please. Or, since you're helping, have you roll a dexterity check with advantage, because you're helping her.
-MARISHA-
Okay. Just straight dexterity?
-MATT-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
15. Okay. You manage to find and arrange them in a way where they aren't going to slide off and even with a bit of rain that's in there you find the pockets where they originally, mostly sitting so they're not going to coast with any sort of weather shift.
-MARISHA-
It looks all right, right? Okay.
-LAURA-
I pick up Nott. I walk her as we tiptoe across the roof.
-MATT-
All right. You guys are noticing at this point as they're on the roof, because you're paying attention you see them begin to emerge on the roof as you begin to see a cluster of crownsguard doing a pass through the street.
-TALIESIN-
So I know that we can see if they're coming through?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
We may need to distract. I'm going to: Go fuck with the dog. I push the cat away with that. And do you want to go out?
-TRAVIS-
Do what?
-TALIESIN-
Do you want-- we distract Crownsguard?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, of course. Yeah. (clears throat)
-MATT-
There's four of them that are approaching and they're going by and keeping an eye on things.
-TRAVIS-
I walk up to the four of them.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I heard there's a disturbance over here. I need some assistance, please.
-MATT-
"What kind of disturbance?"
-TRAVIS-
There's a rowdy bunch over here, been drinking too much already, anticipating the festival. Would you come with me?
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, god. 13.
-TALIESIN-
Can I assist?
-MATT-
Technically, no because you weren't part of it.
-TALIESIN-
I was about to-- yeah, I know, yeah.
-MATT-
Had to catch it before the roll, unfortunately.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
That's okay, (chuckles) he rolled a one. The snitch isn't working for me tonight.
-LAURA-
Oh god. <i>Move</i>.
-MATT-
So the two of them don't seem to quite buy into it, but the two of them that go, "Well, all right. We'll follow. Lead on." Leads the three-- you jog along. Two of them continue their route.
-TALIESIN-
How's your evening going gentlemen?
-MATT-
"Keep moving along."
-TALIESIN-
Want a free tarot reading? I'm on a five-minute break for the entertainment.
-MATT-
"We're all right, but thank you." They keep walking.
-TALIESIN-
I sent the cat, so the cat should be--
-LIAM-
Yeah. (angry meow)
-MATT-
Frumpkin makes his way around. (barking) Again, the dog unleashes a torrent of barks, like "No, not again!" You hear the other guy being pulled across the yard. He's being dragged through the wet grass. You guys begin to make your way across. Who's carrying Nott across?
-LAURA-
I will.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm going to try to hook Nott over me. So like she's attached.
-MATT-
Make an athletics check as you try to make your way across the rope.
-TRAVIS-
We've got this.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to try to hold the rope as hard as I can. (grunts)
-LIAM-
Athletics check? For everybody, right?
-MARISHA-
Oh come on, girl.
-LAURA-
Five.
-MARISHA-
Fuck! That's not good.
-TRAVIS-
(chuckling) You pulling your eyebrows off?
-MATT-
So do you want to save yourself or Nott? Because one of you is falling.
-LAURA-
I save Nott and I'll fall.
-MATT-
As you grasp, you loop Nott around the rope.
As you lose your grip, feeling it coming and you tumble down.
Falling three stories.
-TALIESIN-
That many stories?
-LAURA-
Three stories.
-MARISHA-
I know. We were three stories up.
-MATT-
So you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage as you crack! Hit the ground.
-LAURA-
(pained) Oh. Thaumaturgy. Thunder.
-MATT-
As you impact, the two guards that were talking to you and chatting, immediately whip around and see Jester on the ground and put their hands on their weapons and begin rushing towards her.
-LAURA-
Am I on the outside of the--
-MATT-
You're on the outside of the fence, yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay, that's great.
-MATT-
Like just barely. You just missed the wall.
-MARISHA-
Do I have Nott on the rope?
-MATT-
Nott is up on the rope, hanging and dangling.
-MARISHA-
Can I pull Nott up and roll over and hide on the rope? Or on the roof?
-MATT-
Sure. You tug her over onto the roof.
-TALIESIN-
There you are, dear!
-LAURA-
Am I 12 damage?
-MATT-
12 damage.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm running with them to see what happened.
There you are dear! Good god! There were those hooligans that were roughing us up earlier.
Are you all right?
-LAURA-
They hurt me so bad.
-TALIESIN-
I knew you were going to be okay, anyway. Do you mind helping?
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-TALIESIN-
I know. Fucking--
-TRAVIS-
Come on!
-LIAM-
Come on, Tal!
-TALIESIN-
Nope. Four.
-LAURA-
But I was helping because I'm bloody.
-MATT-
You should have said before the roll.
(groaning)
Okay. They both go "All right, miss." They pick you up and the other guy takes your arm and is like--
-TALIESIN-
Hey, I'm only a little drunk.
-MATT-
"Right. All right." They drag you and start bringing you towards the gates out of the Tri-Spire.
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-MARISHA-
So wait, she was on the other side of the gate?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-MATT-
So you two make your way--
-LAURA-
But I'm staying at the Pillow Trove tonight.
-MATT-
"Miss, you've got to sober up and you can find your way back tomorrow morning." So they escort you out of the Tri-Spire. You guys are pushed beyond the gates and there's now eight guards at each gate that are preventing any passage in and out. You guys are shoved back out into the city.
-TALIESIN-
You're a gofficer and a nentleman. Thank you very much.
-MATT-
However, that distraction gives you guys enough time to get the rest of you over and down to the beyond the tree.
-MARISHA-
Okay, yeah. I like do a climber's loop harness and tie Nott around me, around my middle section and then get over.
-MATT-
Okay. So you guys all get across. You leaving the rope there or are you detaching it?
-MARISHA-
No, I'm trying to detach it if I can. No trace.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I love his facial expressions from here.
-MATT-
Make a dexterity check.
-LIAM-
Work that shit. This is--
-MARISHA-
Fucking-- Gil! Gil, you're a piece of shit today!
-MATT-
Aw, Gil.
-MARISHA-
Six. I love you, Gil.
-LIAM-
How far away is where the grapple is hooked from us right now?
-MATT-
It's about ten feet from you.
-LIAM-
I cast Unseen Servant. Schmidt lifts up the grapple and tosses it free.
-MATT-
Okay. The rope does break, and the grapple bends. The grapple's not usable anymore. You do remove the evidence, but the grapple’s not usable at the moment.
-MARISHA-
Your lips are getting purple again.
-TRAVIS-
Faces of death.
-MATT-
As you guys pull yourselves away from the vicinity about 45 minutes later as you guys are collecting yourselves eventually the paralysis wears off.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
It lasted for an hour total.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Wow.
-TALIESIN-
You had time to think about that.
-SAM-
The chest is trapped.
-MATT-
What are you guys doing?
-LAURA-
We are booking it to try to get to the sewer entrance so we can get back in.
-MARISHA-
It will-- I guess--
-TALIESIN-
Wait, yeah.
-MARISHA-
We'll try and meet up with these guys?
-LIAM-
We need to get to our next target immediately.
-MARISHA-
We need to get to our next target.
-LAURA-
I've got the fucking letters.
-MARISHA-
Correct. So they'll know to meet us there.
-LIAM-
Everybody's going to the same place.
-MARISHA-
Correct. Let's get there and then we'll wait for Jester and Jester.
-MATT-
Yeah. Ulog pulls out a pocket watch and he looks and it and is like "Oh, she better fucking hurry up. Let's go." You guys make your way over towards where the High-Richter's home is.
-SAM-
How is she going to get back in to the--
-TALIESIN-
We can disguise you.
-MATT-
The two of you guys head back--
-LAURA-
Oh yeah, I have the disguise charm.
-TALIESIN-
Well, no, the charm won't work.
-MATT-
You guys are heading back to where the sewer is, you're saying?
-TALIESIN-
I was thinking about pushing straight through the front door again.
-LAURA-
You want to try?
-TALIESIN-
I've got a coat and a mask.
-LAURA-
Is there another entrance we can go to?
-MATT-
There is another entrance. It's on the northern side.
-LAURA-
Well, it'll probably be faster to do that than to go--
-MATT-
Could be.
-LAURA-
Okay. We'll book it to the other entrance.
-MATT-
Okay, you rush around through the street.
You make your way back to the northern gate to the district and there there is another nine or ten guards stationed, with one on the top of the wall with their crossbow ready.
-LAURA-
I'm pristine and sober.
-MATT-
As you approach, "Hey! Sorry, no entry. The gala is tonight."
-LAURA-
I know. We're going to the gala.
Obviously.
-TALIESIN-
Masked.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-SAM-
Because all the checks tonight have been so good.
-MATT-
I know. The rolls have been phenomenal.
-LAURA-
Okay! 18.
-MATT-
18?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Gives you both a look over.
"All right, then."
-LAURA-
We run as soon as we’re in.
-MARISHA-
How long were we waiting there? Were we waiting long enough to where we can take a short rest?
-MATT-
Yeah. Because of-- yeah, you can take a short rest.
-MARISHA-
Fuck yeah.
-MATT-
You get that back.
-LAURA-
I guess I'll cast Cure Wounds on myself as we're running.
-SAM-
Short rest? Can we use hit dice?
-MARISHA-
Yes, we can.
-MATT-
So you guys get to use hit dice, they do not.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Okay, eight points healed.
-TALIESIN-
That's nice.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Psst, Marisha, how do you tell how many hit dice you have?
-MARISHA-
It is generally your level plus whatever your class is. So I'm 1d8 plus three.
-TALIESIN-
It's in your short rest button.
-SAM-
It is?
-MARISHA-
Oh no, sorry. I currently have 3d8.
-TALIESIN-
Short rest is down at the bottom.
-MATT-
There you go.
-LAURA-
Okay. So we're trying to avoid the guard so we don't get spotted again and get kicked out again.
-MATT-
Yeah. You guys carefully find a space that's away and out of sight, probably by one of the small fountains on the side and you all sit there and rest for a bit, having drinks. Eventually, you guys manage to catch up with the rest of the group as they're finishing their short rest. You've reconvened, you have your materials.
-LAURA-
That went really well, I think. Did we put everything back in order before we left the room? We did, right? Yes, we did.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I mean, good enough. The only thing that's going to be obviously missing is the fucking rug!
-LAURA-
The magical rug.
-MARISHA-
I wasn't anticipating a rug. But we beat the rug. Get it? We beat the-- we <i>beat</i> it.
-TALIESIN-
Is this a thing that really happened?
-LAURA-
Yeah, there was a rug that turned to life and attacked us.
-MATT-
Ulog's staring at his pocket watch, again looking off at the gala in the distance, is like "All right, if we're going to fucking do something, let's do it."
-LAURA-
Let's go! We go to the High-Richter's house.
-MARISHA-
Ulog. How much longer do you think is left of this gala?
-MATT-
"Ah," and he looks off and is like, "I don't know. Fuck it. Let's go now. I can't wait any longer."
-MARISHA-
Molly. If the High-Richter tries to come back, you have to drunkenly distract her. Okay? You cannot let her come in this house.
-SAM-
How are we getting into this house?
-MARISHA-
Well, we scouted it before.
-SAM-
Yeah. We found out that there's a door.
-MARISHA-
And more guards.
-SAM-
But that doesn't give us a way in.
-MARISHA-
Same plan. Just go with it.
-SAM-
But there's no trees!
-MARISHA-
Shut up! There is!
-MATT-
No. You're on the outskirts of the home, and you've been here once before, this wall is not an iron gate. It's an actual solid, tall stone and mason wall that’s pretty tight. There's maybe a three-foot gap between the side of the house, like three or four-foot gap from the side of the house to this. The building is two stories. There is the upper balcony that overlooks the whole exterior of the area before it. There are the two guards at the front.
-SAM-
We need to take them out and go through the front door.
-LAURA-
Maybe-- Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
Do you want to look like the High-Richter and walk in without saying anything?
-SAM-
<i>You?</i>
-LAURA-
You want to be a guard and I can look like the High-Richter?
-TRAVIS-
Let's do it.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
We met the High-Richter before, you know.
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Yes. Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Yep, I'll Disguise Self to look like a crownsguard.
-LAURA-
I cast Disguise Self and look like the High-Richter.
-MATT-
Okay. In what outfit?
-LAURA-
(muttering) Oh, god.
-MARISHA-
She had ceremonial armor--
-LAURA-
Yes, but she was probably going to the gala tonight.
-MARISHA-
That was gold and white ceremonial armor.
Yeah, but I'm sure--
-SAM-
Wait, before you do this, why don't we go to the festival and see what she looks like?
-MARISHA-
We don't have time.
-LAURA-
There's no time.
-LIAM-
What if she came home with some crazy outfit? Crazy cloak.
-LAURA-
I'm going to put her in a cloak that looks like it had wine spilled on it. Like, covering up the rest of the outfit, a big--
-SAM-
A <i>white</i> cloak?
-LAURA-
A white cloak that looks like it had red wine spilled down the front. Fjord, you explain to the guards that I'm very pissed off because someone spilled their drink on me.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-MATT-
All right. What are the rest of you guys doing?
-SAM-
I'm going to go around and see if there's any other entrances, or if there's any other guards around the perimeter.
-MARISHA-
I join Nott. We'll flank.
-MATT-
Make a perception check with advantage, because they're helping you on this one.
-SAM-
Okay, seven.
-MARISHA-
What the fuck?
-MATT-
You don't see any secret entrances, you don't see any other gates. Looks like the front door is the main way to get in, or over the wall.
There is no one watching the back, as it is a solid gate. It seems like the only entrance is from the front, and that's probably intentional from a defensive standpoint.
-LIAM-
How high is the wall?
-MATT-
The wall is about-- let me check real fast.
This would be seven-foot.
-LIAM-
Seven foot? Frumpkin's on top of the wall.
What do I see?
-MATT-
You glance down. A small area of wildflower and natural bushes have grown to fill the space in between, where it's thigh-high. There is a door in the back, near the wall, with a small yard, maybe a ten-foot yard, towards the very back area.
There's a small porch area with nice chair and a little reading nook. There's a book left outside that looks like it got rained on and forgotten, it's dried and crinkled. There is a door that leads in from the back of that porch area there.
-LIAM-
Are there any people?
-MATT-
There are no people in the back.
-MARISHA-
You want me to give you a boost?
-LIAM-
Yeah. I relayed that all to them. There's nobody back there, right? Yeah. Seven feet tall. Easy.
-MARISHA-
Nott, come on, ready? Me and Caleb. One, two, three.
-SAM-
(squeals)
-MATT-
Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics, for you.
-LAURA-
Why are you going in?
-MARISHA-
Just in case? Backup.
-SAM-
17.
-MATT-
Without even touching the wall, you double-flip in the air and land, ever so silently.
You almost land on the book table, causing it to knock over, but you just miss it. You're there quietly now, there's the door across the way. What are you guys doing?
-TRAVIS-
We're going in.
-LAURA-
We're disguised and we're walking straight up.
-MATT-
You approach the two guards and they both look at each other.
-LAURA-
I look incredibly angry.
-TRAVIS-
I'm about ten feet in front of her, and I walk up. All right lads, open up. She's in one of her moods. Had wine spilled all over her. Hurry up!
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-SAM-
This is it.
-TRAVIS-
22.
-MATT-
22. They both go, "Oh, shit. Right in."
-TRAVIS-
Quickly, I like this detail. Open up.
-MATT-
One pulls out the key unlocks the gate. They open from each side as you rush through. Make a deception check for you as well.
-LAURA-
Just walking?! Why? I'm walking!
-MATT-
With advantage, because you're dressed as her.
-SAM-
Thank god. Much better.
-LAURA-
That's 18.
-MATT-
They both go, "Ma'am." They both pull back, frightened. You go to the front door. It's locked.
-SAM-
Oh, no.
-TRAVIS-
You fools, open the door. Don't you see she's in a state?
-MATT-
One of them rushes forward and unlocks it, glancing out of the side of his eye towards you, shaking.
-LAURA-
I breathe really hard.
-TRAVIS-
I am so sorry, High-Richter. I assure you, this night is almost over. Would you hurry up?!
-MATT-
"Gah!" Opens the door and it throws open.
-TRAVIS-
I follow in behind her.
-MATT-
They close the door quietly behind you.
-LAURA-
Is anybody inside the house?
-MATT-
No. It is dark. There is no light source on the inside right now.
-TRAVIS-
I've got darkvision. Can I see anything?
-MATT-
It's low light through the vicinity. You see the interior chamber that is--
-MARISHA-
(hyperventilating)
-MATT-
It is gaudy as fuck in here. You see all the walls have really intricate siding and there's inset designs that are carved into it, with statues and busts of various elven figures. The main chamber leads to a spiral staircase that leads to the second floor. You see three busts on each side of all these different elven, very regal-looking figures adorning each side. You see around the side of it to the right, there appears to be a dining hall with a long table.
(metal hitting the table)
-SAM-
Sorry.
-MATT-
There you go. To the left it, looks like a kitchen vicinity, and there's the spiral staircase that leads up.
-TRAVIS-
We should go up.
-LAURA-
There were a lot of traps in the last house we were in.
-MATT-
Outside of the wall where you guys are, Ulog's like, "My turn. Give me a lift?"
-MARISHA-
Fuck. God, are you sure, Ulog?
-LIAM-
You're going up?
-MATT-
"Are we not going in?"
-LIAM-
I'm going in with her. Kneel down. I'm going to climb up on his back and start to try to climb.
-MATT-
Make an athletics check.
-LAURA-
Why? Why are we adding more things to this?
-MARISHA-
You at least need a rogue. All you need is the rogue.
-TRAVIS-
Don't have to do it all.
-LIAM-
17.
-MATT-
17. You climb up over the wall and get to the very top. He puts his hands up. "Help me."
-MARISHA-
Ulog. No, Ulog, why don't we stay? They can plan it. Let's just fucking stay.
-MATT-
"Because I helped put this together. I want to be here. I want to make sure this happens."
-MARISHA-
Ulog, listen to me. You are here. You are a part of it, just let them do this. Trust us.
-MATT-
"Understand, she might have paperwork up there that could absolve my wife."
-MARISHA-
Ulog, this is not the point of why we're here in the moment. Stay focused. We can get your wife out later. Don't blow the whole operation because of your wife.
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-MARISHA-
Fuck.
-SAM-
Beau's got all the persuasion.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it's not my thing, you guys.
Four total.
-MATT-
He gives you a nice, solid look and goes, "Understood," and then leaps up onto the wall and off the other side, landing next to Nott.
-LIAM-
Oh, he leaps? I was going to say, seeing that argument, that I dropped down to the ground on the other side. And not help him.
-MATT-
He glances up, sees you gone, and leaps. He barely crests the top. He's a nimble dwarf.
-MARISHA-
He could cost us everything.
-TALIESIN-
Slightly ahead of the house, so I can see if people are going to be approaching the house, I put my jacket down and set up a little busking. A mild busk.
-TRAVIS-
Jester, I know we have to move, and it's not our thing, can we roughly check the stairwell for traps?
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-LAURA-
Same, I'm looking around.
-MATT-
Make it with advantage.
-TRAVIS-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
As you glance about the space, you can see the statues that are facing each other on each side, it looks like the dust on the pedestal is brushed off in an arc, like they are often rotated.
-TRAVIS-
This is set up to-- wait a minute. If we came home, there's got to be a way to turn it off, right? I mean, if she had walked in, she wouldn't be trying to look out for the traps. Maybe there's something by the door jamb or in the wall, or something we can press.
-LAURA-
There was a little brick that turned off all the magic things in the other place, so maybe can I look around on the walls and see if there's some sort of--
-TRAVIS-
Can we check the door jambs and the walls?
-LAURA-
To see if there's a trigger to stop all the traps?
-MATT-
Because you rolled a natural 20, you notice that the dust that's grinding is from the sliding of the statues, and they all seem to slide towards the stairs. If you look where the dust is on them, there's a slight outcropping on each of them and the position appears like they have been moved many times away-- they're facing each other-- to look toward the stairs.
-LAURA-
Let's turn them. We turn them together.
-TRAVIS-
The same time, one at each.
-MATT-
As you do that, they both (stone grinding), and you hear this (click) sound. The first two, they shift over towards that, matching the space where the dust had shifted, and you hear a slight click or release sound.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. We head up the stairs.
-LAURA-
Yeah, sure. We start walking to look for her room.
-MATT-
There's three sets of these. So you do one then the other.
-TRAVIS-
Each one. One, two, three, one two three.
-MATT-
You do it together, all three of them shift, and with each one you hear a click and release.
You guys are in the backyard. Are you doing anything?
-SAM-
I'm going to try to open the back door.
-MATT-
The three of you are back there with the lock.
-LIAM-
I cast Detect Magic.
-MATT-
The back door is locked. Make an investigation check, if you'd like.
-MARISHA-
It's coming back around!
-MATT-
I know, look at this! The back door is locked, it is not trapped.
-SAM-
Okay, I will unlock it.
Not so good. Nine.
-MATT-
You go and get the tools in there and it gets stuck.
-SAM-
Ulog! Ulog, I need your help.
-MATT-
"Oh, so now you need my help. Perfect." Yeah, that'll do it. He goes ahead and takes them from you and then (click), gets it, pulls them out gently, hands them back to you.
-SAM-
Does he come around the back of me?
-MATT-
Like Ghost-style? He does so, but he does so begrudgingly. He's like (grumbles). He pulls away and quickly gets it, and hands them back to you.
"Here you go."
-SAM-
The pleasure was all mine.
-MATT-
"Ugh." Opens the door, you guys hear the slight creaking of a doorway down in the second floor as you're ascending the stairs.
-LIAM-
I grab both of her shoulders and peer in to see if anything glows.
-MATT-
You glance inside. It does not appear anything in the vicinity-- It's a dining room. You can see the opposite side of a long table with chairs. Make a perception check.
-SAM-
At a time like this?
-TRAVIS-
Our front door creaked open when we came in?
-MATT-
No, you heard a door down below. You heard them enter from elsewhere in the building, but you just heard a (creak).
-MARISHA-
Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall?
-MATT-
What?
-MARISHA-
Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall?
-MATT-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to try and get Frumpkin's attention. "Tell Caleb to watch out for Ulog."
-MATT-
(meows) Jumps down into the back and goes and catches up to you. You glance inside. Nothing magical catches your attention in the chamber.
-MARISHA-
Can Beau be casing and be full-on stealth mode watching for anything?
-MATT-
Yes. Make a stealth check? You, as you begin to set up busking, one of the other guards wandering by comes by, kicks your cards a bit, and goes, "Hey, hey! Move along. No street busking, too late. Gala's on."
-TALIESIN-
Oh, no, I'm on break. One on the house?
-MATT-
"I said piss off. Keep moving."
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to very slowly put my stuff together and fold it all up.
-MATT-
He sits there and watches you do it.
-TALIESIN-
Move around, yeah, but as long as I have an eye on the main thoroughfare.
-MATT-
Okay. What did you roll for stealth?
-MARISHA-
Ten. I'm going to flip my coat to the brown side.
-MATT-
You walk around, as you're casing the joint, as you're watching, you keep an eye on the two guards to the front. The two guards are looking out, and one of them makes eye contact with you, and as you walk, he watches you walk, and you realize that moment that you've been noticed.
-MARISHA-
I keep walking.
-MATT-
You're being watched from a distance.
-LAURA-
You've been made!
-MARISHA-
I keep walking and I look casual. Do I see any crowded areas?
-MATT-
No, most everybody's at the gala right now.
You can see in the distance, you can see the party's still going on. The music's still playing from the distance. There's still drinking and revelry muffled in the distance, the din of the crowd giving this low (distant cheering).
-MARISHA-
If I get a chance, I want to try and lose him.
-MATT-
He's not following you. He's just watching you as you walk. So you're going to try and move out of his eyesight?
-MARISHA-
I'm going to try and move around, yeah, and move out of his eyesight.
-MATT-
You move out of his eyesight.
-MARISHA-
Anything? Do I notice any following me?
-MATT-
Perception check.
-MARISHA-
Balls.
-TRAVIS-
Not today.
-MARISHA-
Ten again.
-MATT-
Nothing seems to catch your eye, no one following you. You guys, you heard the creak from downstairs. What are you doing?
-LAURA-
What's that? Do you think somebody just got home?
-TRAVIS-
We've got to keep going. We can't stop now.
-LAURA-
Okay. We keep looking for traps up on the top floor and looking for a bedroom.
-MATT-
You head to the top floor. Investigation check, both of you. You guys, what are you doing?
-LIAM-
What do we see? What do we see where we are?
-MATT-
There's a long dining room table with chairs set up.
-LIAM-
Doors out of here?
-MATT-
It leads out into a foyer area.
-TRAVIS-
19 investigation.
-LAURA-
Nice, 15 for me.
-MATT-
You get to the second floor. There's a small landing and a singular door. The door does not appear to be locked or trapped.
-SAM-
Want to send Frumpkin in?
-LIAM-
No. We move forward. You ten feet in front of me. I will look for magic, you will look for physical obstacles. Here we go.
-SAM-
Great. Let's go. (chanting) Checking for traps.
-LIAM-
(chanting) Checking for magic.
-MARISHA-
Checking for traps, checking for traps.
-MATT-
As you guys head through the dining area into the main foyer, you see there is the hallway that leads into the kitchen, the staircase that spirals upward, and these statues that are all facing towards the stairs. The statues give off a magical glow, and you hear the sound of a (creak) upstairs, a door slowly creaking open. As you guys look into the chamber, as the door swings open, you see a darkened bedroom, equally gaudy as the rest of the house. You can see along the walls there are portraits of men, human, different ages, that are all lining it.
-SAM-
It's One Direction.
-LIAM-
No!
-MATT-
You can there's a small chamber, an archway that leads into a washroom. You can see an ivory basin that's barely visible from the little bit the moonlight that's coming through, a gable window on the opposite side of the chamber.
-LAURA-
What's a gable window?
-SAM-
I think you have one at your house. In your kitchen?
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
It protrudes a bit, arcs, then ends there.
In the center of where that gable window is, there's--
-LIAM-
A kraken.
-MATT-
A roller desk. The front has been rolled shut. There's a door on each side of the gable window that leads to the balcony that you saw before, that looks over everything. It's a giant glass window that looks out over the city. It has a beautiful view of the Tri-Spires and the gala in the distance. You can see the light emanating over the dark night sky.
-LAURA-
This might be a good place to leave the letter.
-LIAM-
Can you message the others?
-MATT-
There is a large bed, and floor itself is covered in tiger and animal skins as a means of decor in the space. The walls themselves are a faint gray-blue velvet texture. It's terrible.
That's what you have in front of you.
-LAURA-
Should we look for traps in here?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, one more time.
-LAURA-
One more time, we're looking for more traps.
-TRAVIS-
Anything that's an obvious trap in the bedroom.
-LIAM-
We're moving through the foyer.
-SAM-
I cast Message upstairs blindly, not knowing where they are, saying: we're in the house, we're coming up to help you. You can, of course, reply to this message.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, you're on fire!
-TRAVIS-
23 investigation.
-LAURA-
Nice. I rolled a 12 investigation. I respond, and I say: We're upstairs in her bedroom or office or something.
-SAM-
They're upstairs! Let's go! Ulog, they're not upstairs.
-MATT-
"Right." You guys all head up the stairs together as a group. Perception check on both your guys' points.
-SAM-
Oh, shit.
-LIAM-
Girl!
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
-MARISHA-
Oh, did you <i>see</i> it?!
-LAURA-
Oh god, these lookouts!
-SAM-
Everyone <i>thinks</i> that Matt is managing three storylines right now, but there's actually a fourth that we don't even know about.
-MARISHA-
Five.
-MATT-
Five.
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
-MATT-
Okay. You guys keep an eye out in the vicinity. Nothing seems to pique your interest.
-MARISHA-
I switch my robe.
-MATT-
Again? Okay. Good to know. All right. You guys check around. There are no traps in the vicinity. You do, as you approach the roller desk, it is locked. There is like an actual keyhole and there is something that is meant to unlock the desk.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck. There's a key.
-LIAM-
Nott and Caleb are still going up the stairs.
-MATT-
Yeah. And Ulog-- you guys all come up to the landing and you can see the door inside. Nothing magical in the vicinity other than what you guys have on yourselves.
-LAURA-
I feel along the edge under her mattress and see if I can feel any keys.
-TRAVIS-
Can I reach underneath the desk and behind it? Underneath it.
-MATT-
Okay, make an investigation check.
-SAM-
Yeah, <i>grope</i> that desk.
-LAURA-
Anything she's like stuck--
-TRAVIS-
17.
-SAM-
Yes, look at you!
-MATT-
Reaching around the desk, there's no tricks, no trips, no buttons or anything. You're looking through the bed?
-LAURA-
I'm reaching under her mattress and seeing if she's stuck anything between.
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-LAURA-
Natural 20! (cheering)
-TALIESIN-
You know what kind of fold she uses in her undersheet. It's like that.
-MATT-
Nice. Reaching underneath, you find a hard object, a binding, and you pull-- it's a book. You slowly pull it out and take a look at it.
-SAM-
(whispers) Tusk Love!
-LAURA-
(laughs) Volume one.
-MATT-
No. It's a familiar leather tome that was an illegal story that was previously presented to you in a smut bookstore that had been hidden in the cushions of the bed. It has a place marker about two thirds of the way through.
-LAURA-
Oh, she's naughty.
-MATT-
Ulog at this point is looking about the room as well. He rushes over to the desk where you are and he goes, "Don't worry, I got this." He's going to go ahead and attempt to pick the lock on that.
-LIAM-
Have the vagrants caught up yet?
-MATT-
Yeah, you guys have all caught up. You're in the room now.
-LIAM-
Detect Magic wipe in this room.
-MATT-
As you glance through, there is a faint magical essence that begins to appear from the desk as Ulog (click) opens it. It slides open and you see a faint glow from a small case about that large sitting on the desk.
-LIAM-
Leave that box, that case, that box, be careful.
-MATT-
"That's fine." He starts--
-LIAM-
No, it's not fine!
-MATT-
No, he's going through paperwork.
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
He's grabbing books and he's starting to thumb through--
-TRAVIS-
The priority is the letter. Let's start getting that paperwork.
-LAURA-
I run over with the letter and can we put it in her desk to hide it? The sealed letter.
-MATT-
Yeah. Go ahead and place the letter in there.
-SAM-
Should I open the little box again?
-LAURA-
Oh, is there a fireplace?
-MATT-
There is no fireplace in this room.
-SAM-
Schmidt!
-TRAVIS-
Aren't we supposed to toss the room, aren't we supposed to make it-- no, we're coming in and out, so--
-LAURA-
Is there a wastebasket?
-MATT-
You don't see a wastebasket necessarily, no.
There's a small, almost like a pot of some kind that is set next to the desk that looks like it might be used as a receptacle occasionally.
-MARISHA-
Oh yeah, like a bedside pot.
-LIAM-
What is the type of magic emanating from the case?
-MATT-
That would be evocation.
-LIAM-
Evo-- (gasp) that's bad.
-TRAVIS-
Let's leave it alone. Let's get the letters in and the seals. Let's place it all.
-MATT-
Make an intelligence check.
-SAM-
Suspense!
-LIAM-
18.
-MATT-
18. While the shape is not familiar to you, the size and the length of it, you've seen these type of cases before. They're usually used to contain important rolled pieces of parchment, specifically those that need to be protected from the elements because they contain enchantments on them. This is a scroll case.
-SAM-
Ooh! (taps feet rapidly) Take it! Take it!
-MARISHA-
No trace. Leave no trace!
-TRAVIS-
What are you doing?
-MARISHA-
God no, god!
-MATT-
Ulog is going through papers frantically and like searching through. He's going to make an investigation check.
-MARISHA-
No, don't fucking compromise everything!
-LAURA-
Caleb, I swear to fucking gods.
-TRAVIS-
Come on, the letters.
-LAURA-
Okay, I'll take the-- oh! I'm going to take the torn piece and hide it under her bed. Then I have the letter left, the Knights of Requital letter. Where should I put this?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, right on the desk, right? We should put it right there.
-LAURA-
On the desk as well? No, we should scatter it around so that if certain things don't get found-- is there any other good place like, in her bedside tables or anything like that?
-MATT-
There looks like a space there, it's a table, it doesn't have a drawer or anything, it's just a table you can hide something on or put something underneath.
-LAURA-
Is there clutter on the desk at all, or decorations and stuff?
-MATT-
A faint bit; there's like a candle and a small piece of clockwork.
-LAURA-
I'll fold up the Knights of Requital letter and hide it under her clock.
-MATT-
Okay. At that point, Ulog goes--
-LAURA-
Leave a little bit showing in the back, so that someone could find if they're investigating.
-MATT-
Right. There's another thing that you see there. There is a small box that is wrapped in silver cord that is resting on the desk on top of a stack of books.
-TRAVIS-
We've seen those cords before. Do not touch that!
-LIAM-
Also, there is no other magic around this room in the walls or anything, right?
-MATT-
Not at the moment.
-LIAM-
You've indicated everything that's here.
-MATT-
Everything that you've seen, yes.
-LAURA-
Are there any windows?
-MATT-
There are giant gable windows. You have the most beautiful view of the city.
-LAURA-
Can we see anything out the window? Is anybody coming, is--
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LAURA-
Does it look like the gala is ending?
-SAM-
Do they open, or are they picture windows? Wow.
-LAURA-
Perception check?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LAURA-
21.
-MATT-
Okay. Well, first off, Ulog at this point is going through and he goes, "I found it!" He's reading through and he's like frantically going through the words. "That fucking bitch."
-SAM-
What does it say?
-MATT-
He starts reading out loud as you're glancing over. He says, "These are the notes on Illiana's case. Saying that she wanted to show that even the most unassuming dwarf can be a cutthroat. She admits that she was innocent, but did it anyway just to set an example."
-LAURA-
So we can show this as evidence.
-MATT-
He takes it and folds it. "Oh yeah, we can." He holds it in his hand. As you glance over to the side, you can see the front gate (creak) open.
Sorry, you see it close. (clink) You hear the sound. You guys hear this as well, though you were trying to keep an eye over there, you totally found yourself spacing a bit and didn't notice something shifting towards the door.
-TALIESIN-
As I'm walking away from the house, I start singing loudly, drunkenly (singing) I saw the moon in old, in the darkness.
-LAURA-
Somebody just got home!
-TRAVIS-
We got to get out of here. Let's go!
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to sing loudly as I'm slowly drunkenly making my way.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
We laid the letters. Touch nothing! Let's go!
-LAURA-
Run, run!
-MATT-
"Is it all set?"
-LAURA-
Everything's set! Run! Out the back door!
-MATT-
"Out the back door. All right." You guys all heading outside?
-TRAVIS-
I'm the last one to leave the room.
-LIAM-
Yeah I grab the scroll case--
-TRAVIS-
I summon the falchion. I hold it right up to his throat.
-LIAM-
You have to detect that I did it.
-TRAVIS-
Did you reach for it?
-LIAM-
Of course I did.
-TRAVIS-
I was the last one out of the room. Put it back.
-MATT-
Make a perception--
-LIAM-
Are you in the room?
-TRAVIS-
<i>Yes!</i> I was up here first!
-MATT-
Hold on. Make a perception check. Make a sleight of hand check. That's what this is for.
-TRAVIS-
I said I was the last one in that room.
-MATT-
You were.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck. 13.
-LIAM-
Eight.
-MATT-
Eight? You notice him go for it.
-TRAVIS-
(whoosh) Leave no trace.
-LIAM-
No, I'm taking this.
-TRAVIS-
Put it back, or I'll--
-LIAM-
I'm taking this. This isn't worth my time, I'm taking this!
-TRAVIS-
Put it down, or I'll leave you here--
-SAM-
I pull out my hand crossbow and I point it at Fjord.
Fjord, put that fucking thing down!
-TRAVIS-
(buzzing sound) My hand starts to glow with Eldritch Blast energy. I will fucking leave both of you here. We're either a team, or you're working for yourselves. Decide.
-MATT-
You guys are all watching this from the landing.
-LIAM-
I walk out.
-LAURA-
Somebody's coming.
-MATT-
As you all slowly come to rest and look back, and Caleb, as you walk out, you stop at the landing next to Ulog, and Beau-- oh sorry, you're not there. You stop next to Ulog as, right there at the bottom of the stairs looking up, you see, in a very beautiful, elegant, dark green dress, the High-Richter Prucine. "Hmm. My, my. I'm glad I forgot my gift, or I would have missed you reprobates breaking and entering the home of a High-Richter. I believe that carries a life sentence in the Umber Dungeon, wouldn't you say? If I might ask, what <i>are</i> you looking for? You have my curiosity piqued." There's a brief pause, as you're all glancing down. Ulog holds up the paper in his hand, and he goes, "You. You put my wife in chains and you <i>know</i> she's innocent! We got proof now! It's over for you." She chuckles and scoffs as she falls onto her back leg. "And how do you plan to deliver it? Curious. You think my home won't be swarming with guards in a few minutes?" She pulls a brass bell out from under her pouch and rings it outside--
-LAURA-
No-- I was going to say I cast Guiding Bolt at her, but--
-MATT-
It's such a fast moment, if you didn't have anything prepared, it happens too quickly. You're like "ah!" and the bell rings. "You, stump sucker.
I'll bleed over the extra years of your sentence into your wife's. That way you can both rot together on opposite sides of the dungeon." Ulog looks at you all like, absolute fury and sadness in his eyes. You see like tears down his cheek.
-LAURA-
(whispers) Oh, I had it! Shitballs!
-TALIESIN-
Hold Person?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I had it prepared, and that's what I wanted to cast. (fake sobs)
-MATT-
He goes and takes the paper in his hand and puts it in your arm, Caleb, making eye contact with you, and goes, "Promise me you'll see her freed, friend."
-LAURA-
I cast Hold Person on her!
-MATT-
On her?
-LAURA-
I'm just going to do it.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, do it anyway!
-MATT-
All righty. Natural 20. She resists it. She goes, "What are you trying--" and Ulog goes, (roars) grabs towards his neck and runs, leaps off the stairs towards her and attempts to tackle her.
-LAURA-
We should take off while he does it.
-MATT-
You watch-- yeah. He goes and (boof)! She falls onto the ground and onto the landing of the spiral staircase. They both slide a moment. You watch as she goes, "What are you--" and he grabs and pulls that orange-ish bead that he had on his necklace and slams it into her mouth and holds it over. There's a moment of tension before-- (explosion) A flash of white, fiery, burning light explodes, a fireball sundering the interior of the staircase. You all have your ears ringing.
The pain's there. The ones that are closest by would have been you, Caleb; I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw, please.
-SAM-
(whispers) It was a suicide!
-LIAM-
Seven.
-MATT-
That's a failure.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
Thankfully a shitty roll for you. That is 21 points of fire damage.
-LIAM-
Unconscious.
-MATT-
Caleb goes unconscious onto the ground. As you guys all come to in the moment, you look down at the middle of the staircase: the walls are blackened, the staircase is currently in the process of burning, and down, you see the twisted, gnarled corpses of both Ulog and the High-Richter Prucine.
-LAURA-
(gasps) We have to get out of here!
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we got to go.
-MATT-
You hear (boom).
-TRAVIS-
Jester, help me! We start backing up, yeah.
-LAURA-
I run down, I grab Caleb, and we run out the back door.
-MATT-
As you head down the stairway, you can see the front door being hit from the opposite side.
-MARISHA-
What do me and Molly see?
-MATT-
You guys watch this flash of light. The glass windows shatter outward from the balcony.
The two guards at the bottom go, "Uh!" They quickly throw open the gate and are now currently slamming themselves trying to barricade into the door.
-MARISHA-
To the back!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah. We're going to start flanking to the back.
-MATT-
Okay. As you guys are rushing, make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-TALIESIN-
Natural 20.
-MARISHA-
19.
-MATT-
Okay. As you guys are rushing, you suddenly hear this very loud, high-pitched whine sound.
You're like (pained sound). It causes your head to-- and you, especially glance over as you begin to surmise the direction, you look past and you can see the Tri-Spires there. In the direction, you see the mighty Zauber Spire, of the Halls of Erudition there in the distance, and you see there this growing, black, spherical mass beginning to emerge from the side of the lower third of the tower. You watch as it expands, the whining gets louder and louder.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take cover.
-MATT-
You hear this crack sound as the black sphere suddenly folds into nothing, and where it was, you see all the stone that made that part of the tower collapse, crush, and then stumble. The tower begins to slowly shift, as you hear in the distance screams echoing around. The music stops.
The attention of the guards suddenly shift over from the banging door to the tower crumbling. You watch as the tower-- suddenly there's a flash of blue light, and the tower stops. You see a brief shift of a force field on the bottom that holds it in place, partially collapsed. You see two figures take off from the top.
-SAM-
What is going on?!
-MARISHA-
What are the figures?!
-MATT-
You see two other figures leap out of the hole from where the explosion, weird black sphere was at the base of it, and leap down about 35-40 feet, below the tree line. You see the two figures begin coasting, flying through the air in the direction where they were, as bolts of energy start arcing out of their hands towards where those two other figures fell. The screams are getting louder now and you can see now the guards are starting to rush out of the various street corners. You guys are rushing around-- you were rushing towards the back, and then slowed as this started happening. It's distracting you. You guys start hearing this cacophony outside as you rush through the back door. You get to the back wall.
What are you doing?
-MARISHA-
There's something bigger going on other than us.
-TALIESIN-
We've got to get out of here.
-TRAVIS-
Caleb's unconscious; we've got to get him out.
-MARISHA-
I try and--
-LAURA-
I don't have any spells left!
-TRAVIS-
I have a healing potion, I'll put it in Caleb's mouth.
-MARISHA-
I try and get that back door open and try and get them out.
-MATT-
You get that door open, you guys start rushing out there, you heal up Caleb. You come to consciousness being dragged, your feet grinding.
-LIAM-
I was doing death saves and it was not going well. Just for shits and giggles! (laughter)
-SAM-
Alone upstairs, I pick up the scrolls and put them in my pocket.
-MARISHA-
I mean, the house is on fire now. God damn.
-SAM-
I'm going to open the gable windows, if they open, and jump out them.
-MATT-
Well, the windows are shattered, the explosion--
-SAM-
I jump out the windows and scatter as far as I can.
-MATT-
Make an acrobatics check followed by a stealth check.
-MARISHA-
Holy shit.
-SAM-
Ooh, acrobatics, not great. Ten. Stealth, 16.
-MATT-
Well, you reduce the damage you take by one die, so you only take two points of bludgeoning damage. As you land, your ankle twists, and you tumble and roll and get up. What's your stealth check?
-SAM-
16.
-MATT-
Using the chaos that way and the guards that are now out in the middle of the street, you land behind them. One of them goes to turn in your direction, and you dart behind the wall, leap over the side and arc around to meet the rest of the party, as you all slowly begin to climb over the back wall, where Beau and Molly are waiting for you.
-TALIESIN-
We've got to get out of here.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
That went so bad!
-MARISHA-
I think we were a bigger distraction.
-SAM-
What's going on?
-MARISHA-
I think there's something else going.
-SAM-
Did we do this?!
-MARISHA-
No, we didn't!
-SAM-
It's Molly, isn't it? Molly did it!
-LAURA-
We’re running to the sewers!
-MATT-
Running to the sewers? Everyone make a stealth check as you're trying to make your way through there. People are now starting to run back to their homes, you can see people running and screaming now, dressed in full attire for the gala, leaving their masks behind, screaming bloody murder.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-LAURA-
Five.
-MARISHA-
12.
-LIAM-
Five.
-SAM-
19.
-TALIESIN-
14.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Give it to me!
-TRAVIS-
Bunch of teens and a five!
-MATT-
I know, that's okay. So a couple of bad rolls, but for the most part, you guys averaged okay. Thankfully with the chaos, and the way you are dressed, you manage to push through and mingle well, it wasn't too hard. You make your way through the town, you can see the tower still being held in place and the two figures that you saw gliding before? As this is happening, and you're rushing through, you see a few other bolts hit, a large bolt of lightning grind down in the distance, before eventually they both begin to peer over and are now looking up and down the streets. As you make your way back towards the alley, over by where the gala is, you see a shadowed figure dart out from behind, and a bolt of lightning strike. There's a detonation of burned ozone as the figure falls to the ground, smoking.
-MARISHA-
I go over to the figure, I go over to the figure.
-MATT-
As you walk over to the figure, you see one of the flying entities floating down. You can see now this robed mage figure, with a staff in hand, wearing a large ornamental mantle, long grayish hair, is now gliding down in the direction of the dark figure of the ground.
-SAM-
Male or female?
-MATT-
Male.
-LAURA-
Steer clear of lightning people!
-MATT-
Yeah, you guys see this as you come around--
-LIAM-
Age?
-MATT-
The age roughly, from this distance from what you can see, its later. Older age, 70s human, if human, but you can't quite get the details. It starts shouting, "One has fallen. Find the other," and coasts back off, doing a pass, looking through the various streets.
-MARISHA-
Once he's gone, can I wait to--
-MATT-
Well, the guards have rushed forwards and grabbed the body and are now dragging it back towards the tower.
-MARISHA-
What does that body look like, though?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
Come on.
-MARISHA-
Big money-- (screams in anger). Fucking shit, what is with these fucking rolls! 18. Sorry, sorry, no, that's super wrong.
-MATT-
Aw, 18!
-MARISHA-
I saw an 8 and I was adding shit! 11, sorry, 11.
-MATT-
All you can see is the cloak. The cloak is blocking most of the body, you see a hand behind that's like a leather gauntlet except for fingers exposed. The fingers appear to be-- the glove or design of it are almost like they were dipped in blue. Like there's some sort of a blue tipped glove as its dragged back. That's all the details you can make out, unfortunately, as it's being pulled away off the street. The guards are now swarming, people are trying to get back to their houses. People are swarming the gate out of the Tri-Spire, and the guards are trying to hold them back, calm them down, and it’s nearing a riot at this point. You guys make your way over to the edge of the sewers, begin to look around for a moment where nobody's watching, and one by one make your way down into the darkness, closing it behind you. As you all get down into the quiet of the underground, there's a moment where you can hear the distant muffling of movement. Footsteps, making their way back and forth across the alleyway, other yells and screams, information in the distance, far too far away for you to make out the details of what's being said. What do you do?
-TRAVIS-
Those men were flying!
-MARISHA-
Those men were super powerful.
-SAM-
We need to get far away from here.
-LAURA-
We need to get back to the other side. Oh my gosh.
-MARISHA-
Who were they targeting?
-LAURA-
They were targeting-- I don't know!
-LIAM-
Not us.
-LAURA-
Are you sure they weren't looking for us?
-LIAM-
No, I don't think so.
-TALIESIN-
This was something entirely different.
-LIAM-
We need to go find a shitty place and lay low.
-MARISHA-
He was in blue, his gauntlets were dipped in blue.
-LAURA-
Like the Cobalt people?
-TRAVIS-
Let's get back to the Leaky Tap. We've seen the power of the Dwendalian Empire. That was more than anything I've ever seen, we've got to get back.
-LAURA-
I've never seen someone fly before.
-TRAVIS-
Neither have I. Lightning, it turned him almost into ash. Let's get back, we can talk about it when we're in our rooms safe.
-LAURA-
The High-Richter's dead, you guys. That wasn't part of the plan!
-SAM-
And Ulog too. I think I was sort of mean to him.
-TALIESIN-
What happened?
-MARISHA-
I tried to get Ulog to stay and he didn't listen.
-TRAVIS-
Ulog sacrificed himself. He killed himself and the Richter.
-MATT-
Caleb, at this point you glance down and you're still clutching, in your fingers--
-LIAM-
The stone?
-MATT-
No, the paper that Ulog left behind.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
Are you guys making your way back?
-TRAVIS-
Hell yeah.
-MATT-
You're heading back through the sewers the direction you came.
-LIAM-
We are walking away.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Be aware of the rat balloons.
-MATT-
Barely sneaking away from the insanity of the district, you walk through the darkened sewers down the same familiar path that you walked to make your exit, coming up on one of the false junctions, where the left side of it is partially collapsed but the right side continues to where the T-section is. Beauregard, Caleb and Molly and Jester, because you guys all have the higher passive perceptions, you begin to notice this area where there's no water that drains down the centre groove of this part, you see spatters of liquid.
-LAURA-
Does it look dark?
-LIAM-
What is it?
-MATT-
Well, there's no light in here currently.
-LIAM-
Ah. (foomph), Dancing Lights.
-MATT-
Dancing Lights open up the area here as you hit the intersection. You see it is dark and red.
-MARISHA-
Blood.
-MATT-
It is spatters of blood, and as you glance up right there at the intersection, you see a figure, one hand against the wall, breathing heavily. You glance towards it and take a moment as the light globes are now shifting out to light the space. You see a humanoid figure, seemingly male in outline, adorned in jet black, almost insect-like leather armour that protrudes in large sweeping hooks at the joints - the elbow joints, the shoulders. A helmet that's form-fit black leather and onyx studs wraps around their head. It looks demonic, the brow plate sweeping backwards into rear facing horns. Their other hand is dangling, clutching a cannonball-sized, twelve-sided dodecahedron shape, about that big, that has a handle on each side. It's emitting a dull undulating grey glow.
-TRAVIS-
I cast Armor of Agathys on myself.
-MATT-
As you cast Armor of Agathys on yourself, the figure, which you now see is the source of the blood, looks heavily wounded and is breathing heavily. The lights now up, its head (creaks) turns towards you and you hear a voice say (guttural speech). Does anybody here speak Undercommon?
-TRAVIS-
Undercommon, anyone?
-LIAM-
I cast Comprehend Languages.
-MATT-
What are the components of that one?
-LIAM-
That is verbal, somatic, and material. A pinch of soot of salt which I throw out in front of me.
-MATT-
As you begin to make the incantation, the figure pulls their hand away and draws this horrible, gnarly-looking hooked blade from the sheath, and goes (snarls) and rushes in towards you. And that's where we're going to pick up next week.
(yelling)
-TALIESIN-
No!
-LAURA-
Everything went to shit!
-TRAVIS-
It went perfectly, ha!
-MARISHA-
That was a Crick!
-SAM-
What's a Crick?
-LIAM-
People from Xhorhas!
-SAM-
I thought that was a story.
-LIAM-
No!
-MARISHA-
Crick assassins!
-LIAM-
Trust the porn!
-ALL-
Trust the porn!
-MATT-
Always trust the porn.
-MARISHA-
Edubation! That's why!
-SAM-
I should've been more edubated.
-TALIESIN-
You would be doing better if you edubated every night.
-MATT-
There were a few chances for you guys to see High-Richter Prucine arriving, but you kept rolling low perception on the outside--
-MARISHA-
They were fucking balls!
-MATT-
--and I was like, “All right she's going to get the drop on you guys.” There were so many different ways that could've gone. But it made for an interesting story!
-TALIESIN-
That was a clusterfuck. That was amazing. You're all terrible people.
-LIAM-
Edubate once a day.
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh.
-SAM-
What?! The Crick--
-LIAM-
Oh Fjord, it is over. Bromance is over!
-TALIESIN-
I cannot wait for this shit! I am in this shit! Finally, I'm so excited.
-MATT-
Aw, man.
-LAURA-
It's so good.
-MATT-
Guys, that was awesome, well done.
-TRAVIS-
And Nott took it anyway!
-MARISHA-
I know, she did!
-LIAM-
She's dead. The owner is dead.
-MARISHA-
Well, now! At the moment, though, there's no excuse.
-MATT-
They don't trust people that don't look trustworthy like you, Molly.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MARISHA-
Of course. Doesn't mean they're not shitty selfish ones.
-LIAM-
They are shitty selfish ones.
-MATT-
All righty guys, thank you so much for watching. We'll pick this up next week on Thursday. Talks Machina next week on Tuesday about this episode. Look forward to seeing you guys who are coming to C2E2. Until then, have a wonderful night, have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

-AABRIA-
A thickly built middle-aged man with sun freckled skin shuffles silently through the moonlit corridors of a facility built to brutal scale and proportion.
He's a study of white in pristine cotton pajamas of a patient of the Grayslate Sanatorium, matching his prematurely white hair.
Silva Sarkis, at one time the pride of the Office of Unexplained Phenomena, swallows his fear, and remembers himself and his training through the haze of his mind now that he's gone gray.
There's a mystery here and he seems to be the only one out of the shambling masses, out of the administrators that turn a blind eye up to the challenge of solving it.
There's a sound as he moves.
Shuffling, the shifting of fabric, something rhythmic that breaks through the silence of this terrible place.
Following as fast as he dares, he reaches a dull gray wooden door, slightly ajar.
Inside he sees a nun.
He knows her name to be Sister Iovar and she seems to be slowly lowering herself across the lap of Director Greenvale.
Director Greenvale's eyes are rolled back in ecstasy and expectation.
Then this moment that blushes this older man's cheeks Then this moment that blushes this older man's cheeks is snapped out of reverie as a hand bashes into the window and they both turn and look.
Silva, squinting, sees in the moonlight a face he recognizes.
Another patient that's dropped off the face of the map.
Every time he inquired, "Where did he go? No one gets checked out here," he was met with a shrug or a casual brushing aside.
But this man beats on the window with fingers worked down to bloody shreds, caked in mud, and turns and sprints across the lawn to a clearing.
That startle is just enough time for Silva to get out of the way.
He hides in an alcove as both the nun and the director get up and run through the corridors and outside.
Silva doesn't trust that he can remain unseen.
He can't follow as fast.
There's nowhere to hide.
There's no escaping the sanatorium, except-- He's torn.
He doesn't know if he should go and find and follow and understand, or if he should take this chance and leave.
No one gets to leave Grayslate.
He's been sent here, like so many Periphery officers before him who have seen too much, who have experienced too much.
Things that can't put words to.
He's been locked away forever, but this is his chance.
Maybe he can't solve the mystery of what took this patient and several others away, but there is no other chance for him to make his way to freedom.
So not knowing anything but the hunch in his gut fueled by the haze and the bleed and the stacked trauma of all the things he's seen, he turns and flees and somehow he makes it out.
He makes his way to the only people that he could trust with his information.
Not the Periphery, not any of the administrators of the Triumvirate.
He wanders the streets of the Sidle until he finds someone with a small diamond pin from Candela Obscura and hopes that he will finally be believed.
(sighs) Welcome to Newfaire.
It's a mild day in late spring, though every year seems to recover from the chill of the previous winter with less and less enthusiasm.
There's banners of green and copper decorating the finer parts of the city as it celebrates the 15th anniversary of the end of the Last Great War.
The city is buzzy and alive as the electricity flows through it, as the energy of a world moving back to life flows through it.
Citizens appear in generally good spirits, if such a thing can be said to be known through the slightly dirty dingy window to be known through the slightly dirty dingy window of a quirky little occult bookshop tucked away in a quiet street in the Sidle.
The westernmost district in the city of Newfaire sprawling out towards Westwreck as middle class comforts drive growth.
With tome laden walls, The Antiquarian, we find Lightkeeper Nokari, a tall dark-skinned person, bald, clean shaven a tall dark-skinned person, bald, clean shaven with broad smooth features perpetually dressed in the same shiny gray sharkskin material cut into suits of the style of the time.
Whispering fervently in soft but tense conversation with one Cosmo Grimm, the owner of this place: A chapter house of Candela Obscura.
Liam, would you like to introduce yourself, please?
-LIAM-
(elderly) Yes, of course.
-AABRIA-
Tell us what we're looking at.
-LIAM-
Well, welcome to The Antiquarian, my bookshop that houses many fascinating tomes on the history of the region and occult subjects.
My name is Cosmo Grimm.
I'm 97 years old this year.
I'm a thin, wiry old gentleman wearing a jacket of tweed that is a little large for me and bow tie that is definitely too large.
I roll about the shop in a brass wheelchair.
Spend any amount of time with me and you'll notice a small electrical engine attached to the back.
But for the most part, I wheel myself about with ease.
This is my shop.
I have been a part of Candela Obscura for many, many decades.
I've passed on offers to retire to Lightkeeper status.
I've passed on offers to retire to Lightkeeper status.
I enjoy the field, I enjoy the hunt, I enjoy my own personal studies, and I enjoy my shop.
-AABRIA-
As your conversation gets a little more pitched, I don't think it's until Nokari notices Eloise, I don't think it's until Nokari notices Eloise, another retired member of Candela, who instead of becoming a Lightkeeper decided to have an easier life tending your shop and generally staying out of your way.
She passes by a door and they look over and go, "Understood." Nokari pulls up a chair and takes a seat across from you, still leaning in, still as keyed up as they they were before.
"Cosmo?"
-LIAM-
Yes?
-AABRIA-
"I-I've pushed this off as long as I could, but this is it.
This is your last chance.
You <i>have</i> to retire.
You are a one-man repository of so much information, so much research.
You are wasted in the field, and--" He looks down at your legs and your chair and you can see him trying to figure out how best to broach the subject of your decreased mobility.
-LIAM-
Nokari, Candela has many capable Lightkeepers.
Surely you are staffed to the gills.
-AABRIA-
"There is no one here who has been around as long as you, and I know you know that."
-LIAM-
Better served in the field. I don't mind.
I'm spry. You know that as well.
-AABRIA-
"Your ability to have avoided harm for this many decades notwithstanding," "you are too powerful an asset to lose.
I have pulled my last string on your behalf.
So, you gave me some names weeks ago the last time we had this fight.
It seems as though a new circle must be brought into being.
I need you to understand.
You've been searching for something for so long and I don't presume to know what it is, or I can't speak to how council members speak of you or I can't speak to how council members speak of you behind closed doors.
But this has to be it."
-LIAM-
Cosmo looks-- We're sitting in Cosmo's study in the rear of the shop, and Cosmo looks over his shoulder.
There's a desk to the rear of the room and an oil painting on the wall of a ship, tossed at sea in a storm.
He gazes there a moment before turning back.
Nokari, what exactly is it you are charging me with here?
-AABRIA-
"One final circle.
You are in the field.
They are your people.
Take care of the assignment as you always have, but once your circle breaks in tremendous success or tragic circumstance, you leave the field.
Become a Lightkeeper, continue your research, or--" At that, they lean and look in the direction of where Eloise has toddled off, "Or live a quiet life.
But this is it."
-LIAM-
I suppose we'll jump off that bridge when we come to it.
-AABRIA-
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry I couldn't do more."
-LIAM-
It's all right.
I appreciate our years.
I appreciate you.
I know it's not entirely in your hands, either.
-AABRIA-
"(sighs) I've sent out the call.
They should be arriving shortly, the three you asked for, but one more with a specific tie to whatever this phenomenon is.
I do believe you know him, though.
A Dr. Rajan Savarimuthu."
-LIAM-
Yes, I do.
-AABRIA-
"Good."
-LIAM-
He's a very bright young man.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah."
-LIAM-
I'd be happy to have him within our circle.
-AABRIA-
"Okay. As do the others." At this, they lean in a little more not because there's a need to whisper, but the way you have spoken about your family, the way you refer to them, the gravity of it implies a need for secrecy.
"He'll be a part of it.
Of course, you've been doing a great job of keeping an eye out for him, but I don't need to tell you that they are watching."
-LIAM-
Oh, yes.
I cannot say I haven't had my suspicions.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah.
I believe with all of my being that the work we do is good and just and necessary, but our methods are not always kind." "but our methods are not always kind."
-LIAM-
Well, we've always done what was needed.
Not always comfortable, but definitely necessity dictated our ends.
-AABRIA-
"(sighs) I will brief them on arrival." As you see them transitioning away from this dark moment and sitting back into the plush chair and reaching for a long-cold cup of tea, a little tinkle bell sounds as Doctor, you make your way into The Antiquarian.
as Doctor, you make your way into The Antiquarian.
Ashly, would you like to describe what you look like?
-ASHLY-
Love to.
So Dr. Elsie Roberts is my name.
I'm 33 years old.
And not-- Forgetting briefly that the meeting was supposed to be happening here, I'm walking in a bit disheveled and I see Nokari and I start to surreptitiously try to pin my hair up.
My clothing is in the style of maybe two or three seasons ago.
-AABRIA-
Mm.
-ASHLY-
It's a little worse for the wear, but I've made a very grand attempt for the wear, but I've made a very grand attempt to keep up appearances.
So my hair, my makeup, everything is in the style of the upper class, but it's obvious that I'm not living as well as they do.
So I'm a little off kilter when I come in.
Lightkeeper Nokari.
-AABRIA-
"You're looking well."
-LIAM-
Dr. Roberts, welcome.
-ASHLY-
I forgot we were doing this today. Pardon me, ahem.
I notice as I'm fidgeting that there's some blood under my fingernails.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to freshen a little before the others arrive.
I go into the back and-- I go upstairs.
-LIAM-
Yes, join us downstairs when you are ready.
-AABRIA-
As you scrub up, even over the sound of the water in the sink, you can hear a tinkle of a bell.
You remember now that you were summoned to a meeting, but the only information was that your Lightkeeper, Nokari, had a new assignment, a new circle, and the only person they mentioned was your longtime associate and roommate here in the apartments of The Antiquarian, Cosmo.
You hear a little tinkle and inside steps, unbeknownst to you, Oscar.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
-SAM-
Sure. The name is Oscar Grimm.
I'm a little shorter than Sam Riegel is.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Who?
-SAM-
I'm five foot six, but stout.
Broad chested, broad shoulders, 200 pounds, sandy blond hair, well-groomed mustache.
If you saw him, you'd notice that he's got scars.
Scars all over his face, neck, ears.
-ASHLY-
Are they hot?
-SAM-
The one on his eye is.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
His fingers look like they've been broken and healed incorrectly.
They're off at the wrong angles.
But despite his physical wear and tear, he dresses great.
He's got a sharp three-piece suit, a nice, thick gold chain dangling out of his vest.
He's got a long black overcoat.
When he walks, it's with a limp and a jingle with that chain.
When he pops his head in, he also pops a hard candy.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Wild. Yes.
-SAM-
Always has one in his mouth.
He pushes into the door, looks around, tries to instantly survey the situation.
See if there's any other eyes, any other bodies in the room.
He's a big guy and he looks like he's looking for any danger.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you see that without even looking up, Eloise gives you a wave while addressing the shelves and peeking into that back parlor room where most of the business of Candela takes place.
You observe Cosmo and Lightkeeper Nokari with a very distinct tightening of their eyes that I think they didn't hide that well as you approach.
Would you like to make the first roll of the game?
-SAM-
I would love to.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me a Read.
-SAM-
Okay.
I will roll two dice and take the lower of the two.
-AABRIA-
Oh, great!
-ASHLY-
Oh no!
-AABRIA-
Starting off on a strong foot. Chapter 3!
-SAM-
Six.
-ASHLY-
Oh!
-SAM-
And a three.
-ASHLY-
Oh.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
It is very obvious, you look for trouble and you look for the signs of brewing trouble on people as things begin.
But there is something in the lack of hostility that accompanies this coldness that doesn't ping enough in your mind to worry too much about it.
They gesture into the room, but very quickly attempt to move back into conversation with Cosmo.
-LIAM-
Don't just stand there on the doorstep, Cary.
Come in, come in.
-SAM-
Oh, thank you, Cosmo-- uh, Grandpa.
Hi. Who are you?
-AABRIA-
"My name is Lightkeeper Nokari.
I will be handling your assignment and the creation of your circle."
-SAM-
Lightkeeper? What is that, like a general?
-AABRIA-
"It's a Lightkeeper."
-SAM-
Sergeant? Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
"It is what it is.
I help you to shed light on the mysteries that you uncover and deal with.
Not everything is a fight, Mr. Grimm."
-SAM-
Well, not at first, it isn't.
(sighs) Sure.
-ASHLY-
Can I-- Oh I'm sorry. Can I hear this conversation from where I am?
-AABRIA-
Absolutely.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to come out, rinsing, have a towel with my hands.
Oscar!
-SAM-
Oh, hey, Doc.
How you doing?
-ASHLY-
I'm fine. I didn't expect to see you here.
-SAM-
I didn't expect to come honestly, but I was summoned, so.
-ASHLY-
Summoned?
-SAM-
I showed up.
-AABRIA-
"The formation of our new circle."
-ASHLY-
Right. Yes, of course.
-LIAM-
Yes, Oscar is being inducted into our ranks for the first time.
-ASHLY-
Congratulations.
-SAM-
I guess thanks.
It's not really my choice, but I'll take it.
-AABRIA-
"Your skills will be put to good use, I'm sure."
-SAM-
As long as I make it through this in one piece and the old man, too, I'll consider that a win.
-LIAM-
Oscar is good at adapting. Always has been.
-AABRIA-
"Hm." "Good. Nothing then but to wait.
And--"
-ASHLY-
To wait?
-AABRIA-
"For the rest of your circle."
-ASHLY-
What do you mean?
-AABRIA-
You see a look of surprise and they reach into a pocket in the front of their vest and pull out an impossibly small notebook and open it up.
and pull out an impossibly small notebook and open it up.
I think just even flitting through it, you can't even see writing.
It just looks like a vague black line across pages.
They focus.
"That's right, you're normally a part of smaller circles, correct? you're normally a part of smaller circles, correct? Just the Grimms?"
-ASHLY-
As part of an arrangement with the Candela.
I assumed that you would remember.
-AABRIA-
"Huh." "(clears throat) This circle was asked for very specifically by name.
So if you want to take up your grievances, I think you ought to look to your left."
-LIAM-
Who's got their fingers in this pie, Nokari?
-AABRIA-
"It's the people you asked to work with.
At some point, I thought I could give you as many of them as possible.
So you have Oscar-- Cary, what's your preference?" "So you have Oscar-- Cary, what's your preference?"
-SAM-
I mean, my friends call me Cary.
I just don't--
-AABRIA-
So, Oscar?
-SAM-
I don't have a lot of friends.
-ASHLY-
No one calls you Cary, Oscar.
-SAM-
Well, I was trying to-- It was a thing I was hoping would catch on.
-ASHLY-
I see.
-AABRIA-
"Yourself, a Madam Glask, and an individual with a little more of a personal connection to this that was not necessarily on your list, but--" Just at that time, I think maybe we miss the bell on this.
I think maybe we miss the bell on this.
There's something about the suaveness of you slipping in as conversation and pitched discussion happens that allows you to get through the door.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
-NOSHIR-
My goodness.
No doorman here.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Damn.
What an entry phrase.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Gramps, it's very good to see you.
-LIAM-
Welcome.
-ASHLY-
Raj?
-NOSHIR-
It's been a long time since-- Elsie.
Fancy meeting you here.
-ASHLY-
What are you doing here?
-NOSHIR-
Well, (chuckles) I've actually been asked to participate in this little game we're having.
You know me, I'm not usually a team player, but this was too exciting to turn down.
-LIAM-
Hey, I think we're all friendly here, Rajan.
-NOSHIR-
Oh, of course.
Of course.
-AABRIA-
Can I get a physical description?
-NOSHIR-
Rajan is almost 6'.
-AABRIA-
Ooh.
-NOSHIR-
Probably the most glaring thing when you take his visage in is the scars running across one side of his face.
The left side is covered in what look like runic tattoos and he's always head to toe in finery.
and he's always head to toe in finery.
He's well put together, tends to wear gloves when he can.
When he closes the door, you'll notice that he holds a handkerchief in his hand and then promptly wipes it off before he puts it away.
He is brash when at his best and some would argue perhaps obnoxious at his worst.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
A professor from the university.
My specialty is archeology.
I've been brought in because perhaps I can bring a little bit of perspective to this latest trial.
-AABRIA-
"Dr. Savarimuthu, I believe, at some point in the past had dealings I believe, at some point in the past had dealings with what we might be dealing with here.
My information is limited because the eyewitness to this did not take that much in.
But Silva is here and available for deeper discussions once you all arrive."
-LIAM-
Understood.
-ASHLY-
May I-- My hands are gripping around the handles of your wheelchair.
Could we speak somewhere else for moment, Cosmo?
-LIAM-
Yes, of course.
Excuse us one moment.
Why don't you wheel me into my back room?
-ASHLY-
And I do.
-AABRIA-
Elsie, as you wheel him, and you can feel the leather giving under the handles as you push, please take your first token.
-LIAM-
So we are already in my study, but there is a door leading to my private home and bed chambers, the living room.
-SAM-
So as they leave, I'm going to lean over.
So, this one's the Lightkeeper.
I mean, what are you, like something higher than that? Something fancier? I mean, are you some sort of showman or what?
-NOSHIR-
Well, I guess you could call me a consultant, if that helps you.
-SAM-
It does not.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
And who, pray tell, are you?
-SAM-
Oh, Oscar to you.
I'm Cosmo's grandkid.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
I'm just here to make sure none of you all kill yourselves.
-NOSHIR-
Oscar Grimm?
-SAM-
Oscar Grimm. That's me.
-NOSHIR-
Ah, fascinating.
In all my time with the professor, he never mentioned you.
It's a pleasure.
I'm curious to see how you contribute to this crew.
-SAM-
Do you smile all the time?
-NOSHIR-
What's not to smile about?
-SAM-
We'll find out.
I'll go over in the corner and pop another candy in my mouth.
(laughter)
-GINA-
Just going through those.
-AABRIA-
As you head to the corner and scope both the scene within and without through the window, we see a figure approach.
Last but not least, Madam Glask.
As you finally spot the name of the building and make your way in, will you please introduce and describe yourself?
-GINA-
Sure.
I play Madam Glask, owner of the Glass Cat Casino.
She walks in, the door almost opens without her moving it at all.
There is a cloud of light smoke from her rosy cigarettes.
She stands at 5'7", adorned in jewels and fur.
She stands at 5'7", adorned in jewels and fur.
She smells like the most expensive fragrant oils She smells like the most expensive fragrant oils from across the seas.
She walks in, takes her glasses off and says: It's busiest day of the year.
It's the anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Oh! Oscar!
-SAM-
Yeah, hi, Madam Glask.
-GINA-
Hi.
-SAM-
It's nice to see you.
-GINA-
I thought I told you to wait at the door.
-SAM-
I was taking my personal day today.
My grandpa called me to do some work and so I thought I'd take the day off.
I hope that's all right.
I'm sorry.
-GINA-
Fine, but let me know next time.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-GINA-
Speaking of, where is Cosmo?
-SAM-
He's in the back with Doc. With Doc Roberts.
-GINA-
Mm. Excellent, and--
-SAM-
Oh, don't even with this guy.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
I mean-- Yeah, it's--
-NOSHIR-
The legendary Madam Glask.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard many great things.
-GINA-
You've heard of me? How lovely.
She hands out her hand to him. And you are?
-NOSHIR-
Professor Rajan Savarimuthu.
-GINA-
Oh, professor.
How lovely.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-GINA-
She takes off her fur, and when you look at her, you first see such luxury and all the finest things that money can buy.
But you can also tell it's a little bit of overcompensation, too.
Not a single hair out of place.
She tries very hard to carry herself like an upper class, stands up very straight.
But if you look closely, the threads come loose.
She walks in, says: I don't know why Cosmo would call me here I don't know why Cosmo would call me here on such a busy day.
He knows this is when we make the most money. (sighs)
-AABRIA-
"Apologies." Nokari, who has been sitting quietly and appraising both you upon your entry and some of the interactions here with a smirk.
They're not doing any-- They're not hiding it at all.
"Mr. Grimm was operating on my orders.
Mr. Grimm was operating on my orders.
I will be your Lightkeeper and your circle, once a private conversation is finished, will be brought to attention and I will get you all up to date.
Why don't we just have a cup of tea. Eloise?" They try to summon Eloise, who walks in the door and shakes her head a little bit.
Nokari, for all of their suaveness and composure Nokari, for all of their suaveness and composure immediately gets up.
"I'm going to make tea.
I'll do it because I like making tea in a kitchen that I know where that is." Eloise gives him another dirty look as she goes by.
He sweeps out of the room to go find a way to provide refreshments for you.
We'll move slowly into the back chambers.
-LIAM-
Elsie, dear, I can feel your discomfort wafting off of you from across the room.
What is the matter, child?
-ASHLY-
I didn't think that I would need to remind you, Cosmo, of my condition.
There's a reason the circles have been small.
You know that.
-LIAM-
I was not prepared for this meeting.
I had no forewarning.
Elsie. I apologize.
But everyone here I have worked with personally.
But everyone here I have worked with personally.
I can vouch for their expertise and their professionalism.
I trust them. All of them I trust.
-ASHLY-
Do you trust what they would do if they saw me? I can't do this. (shudders)
-AABRIA-
Please take your other token.
-ASHLY-
You need to talk to the Lightkeeper.
Take me off this assignment.
-LIAM-
Dear--
-ASHLY-
You can do it without me.
-LIAM-
Dear, I have a confession.
Before you arrived, I was just informed this may be my last circle.
I don't really have any say in the matter, I think.
It's been coming a long time.
I've seen it coming down the road a long while now.
I hear you, but I also have faith in you, dear.
If this is to be my last go of it, I could really use you here, child.
You've always, for all your challenges, been a steadying presence to me.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
Okay.
Just please try to help keep me calm.
Especially around Raj.
-LIAM-
I have always sensed a little bit of something in the air between you two, but I never wanted to pry.
-ASHLY-
We have history.
-LIAM-
Well, I've worked with the young man a number of times myself and he's always been buttoned up and on point.
I don't know, you, the both of you, each in your own way are like children to me.
He's a good boy.
You are a fine doctor and I have no doubt that we will pull together as circles do, as circles must.
-ASHLY-
I trust you.
-LIAM-
You warm a very old heart.
-ASHLY-
I put my hands around the handles of the wheelchair and they are less tense now.
(deep breath) I'm going to start wheeling him back out and say, as we go: Speaking of being a fine doctor, you've been avoiding your physical.
Then take him into the main room.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs) As you are wheeled back into the main room, this is a very nice wheelchair, but it makes noise across floorboards in this very cozy abode and store, and you see Nokari immediately pop their head back in and they rejoin you, hands empty.
"I didn't find anything, but perhaps it's just better to begin."
-LIAM-
Oh! Godot, come here, boy.
Lad, come here.
There is a little black and tan colored long haired dachshund, a wiener dog who lives here in the shop with me.
He's--
-ASHLY-
I'll get him.
I'll get him.
It's all right.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-ASHLY-
I cross over, being very, very deliberately not looking at Raj and pick up the dog and bring him to you.
-LIAM-
No, no, you hold him.
Give her-- She needs a friend.
-AABRIA-
Oh, he's already all over your face and aiming for your mouth. (laughs)
-ASHLY-
Nope, no. Just--
-LIAM-
Good boy, Godot.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
Thank you.
-GINA-
I go over to Cosmo.
Cosmo, my dear.
It's been weeks since you've been by.
-LIAM-
Madam Glask, I am used to visiting you at your establishment.
You grace us with your presence here at mine.
-GINA-
The pleasure's all mine.
I take both of his hands and I kneel down to him and I kiss him on both cheeks.
-LIAM-
It's good to see you, dear.
-GINA-
You look amazing, as usual.
The girls miss you.
-LIAM-
(laughs) Well, they can beat me at cards again next week, perhaps.
-GINA-
Quite a crew you've assembled, Nokari.
Perhaps we should get to the point.
-SAM-
Yeah, like you said we're becoming a circle.
What is this? You're going to pass out bowls of goat blood to drink or something?
-LIAM-
Oscar, just look and listen.
-NOSHIR-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Boy, look and listen.
-AABRIA-
"A circle is an important and sacred thing.
You will be the Circle of Tide &amp; Bone and in this moment, you are bound together to solve this assignment, to help each other Until such a time as your circle dissolves under good or bad circumstances.
I will admit, loathe though I may be, that I must apologize.
This assignment is not like the ones I am normally entrusted to assign." Nokari moves through the story of an officer, an investigator, and a hunch, and just a gut feeling that something is wrong without proof.
In that, I think there's a little apologetic look in your direction to communicate that this was the flimsiest of circumstances that they could provide in order to get the people you need together in order for you to do whatever you need to do to put your research and your life's work at rest.
to put your research and your life's work at rest.
It's the best an old friend could offer.
They look a little uncomfortable with it as they finish.
"Normally, the inciting circumstances are a little more grave, a little more clear.
But Silva Sarkis, this officer, is here and under Candela Obscura's care and protection until such time as we can determine the validity of his concerns.
So, he is hidden until you report back as to the nature of whatever might be happening at the sanatorium, and is available to you.
Though, I'm not sure how much information you'll get." They gesture back, and back past-- You have your back rooms, and then off to the side, because this is a bookstore and a little bit of an apartment, very multi-use building in the center of a part of town that sprawls out and becomes a little more singular in building type, there is a little garden.
You see sitting amongst some slightly wilted ivy, You see sitting amongst some slightly wilted ivy, a little solid cast iron picnic table, a little, solid, cast iron picnic table, garden table, sits a very nervous man in white pajamas, rocking back and forth, looking around.
"Well, if you have any other questions about the nature of your circle or your work with Candela, I will remit you to the care of your grandfather."
-SAM-
I think I get it.
We go out there, beat this guy up, see what he knows--
-GINA-
Oh my.
-SAM-
-- shake him down, and follow his leads, I guess?
-LIAM-
We normally start with conversation, Oscar.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Normally.
-SAM-
(sighs) Sure, that'll work too.
-AABRIA-
"I leave it to you.
I wish you all the best of luck." With that, Nokari stands and dusts off their suit and puts on their jacket and sweeps out the front door and to parts unknown to handle other assignments, other phenomena.
You are left to the quiet of your room and your interviewee outside.
-LIAM-
Cosmo goes 1,000-yard stare for a moment and just looks back at seven or eight decades of work in Candela.
The things I've seen and the places I've been.
I stick for a moment on how simple and perfunctory the end appears to be.
Well.
Well.
Shall we pick apart this knot and see what we're dealing with?
-GINA-
Oh, we shouldn't pick him apart.
He's been through hell.
How about I try to calm him down first?
-LIAM-
That is one of your specialties. Yes.
-GINA-
Madam Glask walks towards the garden outside and sits next to him and gently puts a hand on his shoulder.
Oh.
You look troubled.
-AABRIA-
As you approach, his eyes immediately lock on you and though there's no move to move away, he's not frightened, but he's skittish.
The moment you reach out a hand, you get that very subtle withdrawal.
You can put your hand on his shoulder, but it's very clear that he is still in a place of agitation where guarding his space feels important to him.
-GINA-
Madam Glask pulls her hands back.
She's very familiar with how to deal with people and their troubles.
She says: Oh, of course, and sits next to him.
I understand that you need our help.
-AABRIA-
"You're with them?"
-GINA-
As of today, I suppose so, yes.
But I wanted to--
-AABRIA-
"You're new."
-GINA-
I'm sorry?
-AABRIA-
"You're new.
You're not a normal-- You're not a-- You're new to Candela.
You don't do this.
They don't believe me."
-GINA-
No, no. Oh, no, no.
No, I--
-AABRIA-
"You're wearing a ball gown."
-SAM-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"It's the morning."
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Oh god."
-GINA-
I don't own--
-AABRIA-
"They're going to send me back."
-GINA-
-- many daytime clothing.
-AABRIA-
"Daytime--" You see, he looks down at his wrinkly pajamas.
-GINA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
I'll wheel myself out.
I assure you, Mr. Sarcas, members of Candela come in all shapes and sizes and just because you're not familiar with Ms. Glask, does not mean she hasn't been a part of our explorations for some time.
-GINA-
I assure you, I am a very good old friend of Cosmo and you can put your trust in me.
-ASHLY-
Can I see this happening even if I'm not there?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
I'd like to just watch him as they're talking to him and see if I can pick up if there's anything psychological or arcane going on with him as he speaks.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Let's get a roll about it.
If you are looking for the nature, the very mundane nature of his distress, give me, let's call it Focus.
A Focus roll, but if you're trying to see if there is something very specifically magickally wrong with him or interacting with him, give me a Sense roll.
-ASHLY-
I'll try a Sense.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ASHLY-
I don't know, let's go.
-SAM-
Come on, let's go.
-AABRIA-
It's going to be so good.
-ASHLY-
I failed.
(laughter)
He's a guy.
-AABRIA-
He's a guy.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
You lean in and you begin to focus on scanning him with doctor's eyes that even with your time with the occult, with your time with Candela, it still all begins with that scan, looking for the first thing wrong, so you can build a pattern, so you can make a diagnosis.
The more you lean in, the more you search him, you don't really notice it but there's something about him, something that he's seen.
I need you to take a bleed token.
-ASHLY-
Oh, shit.
-GINA-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
As something you can't quite clock--
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- is awry with him.
-ASHLY-
Oh, dear.
Baby's first bleed.
-AABRIA-
Baby's first bleed! Welcome!
-ASHLY-
It hurts!
-LIAM-
Mr. Sarcas, our party is gathered.
I suggest we call them all out into the garden so you don't have to repeat yourself.
-AABRIA-
"Yes.
Yes, I will-- (shaky exhale) Yes."
-LIAM-
Oscar!
-AABRIA-
"Ah!"
-LIAM-
Boy! Bring the--
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, okay.
-LIAM-
Bring your new friend into the garden.
-SAM-
Yeah. You want to come?
-NOSHIR-
Oh, that must be me.
-SAM-
Yeah, here.
I'll get the door for you.
I'm sure you're not accustomed to door handles.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to stick--
-NOSHIR-
Fast learner.
-ASHLY-
-- close to Oscar as we go out.
-SAM-
I will--
-ASHLY-
Probably markedly close.
-SAM-
-- puff my chest up and just make sure that there's no sudden moves.
-AABRIA-
Oscar and Elsie move out into this, now getting very cramped little garden.
Raj, you're the last one through.
As you see him, as you move into this space and you begin to share the air of him, you feel it hit you like a freight train.
So my question to you is, what is it-- What does it feel like when you enter into the presence of a tremendous amount of bleed?
-ASHLY-
Ooh.
Shit.
-NOSHIR-
Like being in the middle of a gale, or the beat of a thousand wings.
It pierces through thought and almost bypasses fear, going straight to something much more primitive, so to speak.
It takes a lot of willpower for me to not physically step back in the moment.
-AABRIA-
You feel like you are suddenly overwhelmed, overrun, overcome.
You know before whatever happens next, the longer you stay here, the more you risk taking damage from proximity to a feeling so specific.
You've consulted with Candela before.
You've been in proximity to items and monsters and things of bleed and thinnings and Flare.
But this has all of the scent and understanding of a long, nearly forgotten fear.
This is the bleed, the flavor, the scent of the Maw, and everything you experienced in your childhood.
You're right back there again.
Staring her down, looking at your sister.
And you, if you stay here, will be lost to it.
What do you do?
-NOSHIR-
We need answers and we need them quickly.
-LIAM-
Dr. Savarimuthu, you are looking a little peaked.
-NOSHIR-
I'm fine.
-ASHLY-
Can I tell that he's not fine?
-AABRIA-
That's not a roll. He's not fine.
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
Rajan, do you need to step inside?
-NOSHIR-
I leave this to you, Professor.
-LIAM-
Yes. Yeah.
Mr. Sarcas, perhaps you should cut to the quick of it.
Explain to us what you are in need of.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, last night there's been people disappearing from Grayslate.
We always knew that when you go gray, when it's too much, when you break, they put you away like a fucking child's toy that you're outgrown.
They ship you into that building and you never come back.
But even when you're in it, people go missing.
They just go away.
It might be a jail, but even jails have ledgers and paperwork, and they just don't seem to care.
Maybe I don't get to be what I was before, I don't feel like I did before, but someone should care.
I don't feel like I did before, but someone should care.
It feels like it all started when that nun showed up."
-ASHLY-
At that word I think I'm going to take, if Rajan hasn't gone inside, I might lock eyes with him and go, let's go inside.
-NOSHIR-
I think not, Elsie.
I think this might be a little more important.
Please continue, good sir.
-AABRIA-
There's something in that look, the struggle for your composure that settles Silva, weirdly.
"I wasn't able to find anything, but everywhere she goes, whoever she turns her attention on, they disappear.
Every time I ask a director or any of the orderlies there, I'm brushed off, treated like I'm making a big deal out of nothing.
I, it's, I, if I'm-- (shouts) <i>If I'm crazy, then just--</i> I'm not crazy, I'm not..."
-LIAM-
Perhaps you could help us with specifics.
Who is the clergy woman you are referring to?
-AABRIA-
"She introduced herself as Sister Iovar.
She's beautiful."
-NOSHIR-
The most beautiful woman you've ever seen.
-AABRIA-
"It's, it's eerie, it pulls you in."
-NOSHIR-
You hunger for her.
You're not crazy.
-AABRIA-
"I'm not crazy.
You've seen her, too?"
-NOSHIR-
Yes, we've crossed paths before.
-AABRIA-
"I'm not crazy. There's just something wrong with it.
Wherever she goes, they disappear and no one cares.
Then I saw them that night, her on the director, and I'm a married man, so it's not easy for me to admit what I thought, things that I thought about when I first saw it.
But even through the lust, the wrongness of it, you can't put that away.
You feel it in you even as all the other emotions, all the other urges hit.
Then a patient, Johnny, I don't even know his last name, he was banging on the window.
His hands were ripped up.
He led them away.
Maybe it was the wrong thing, maybe I should've tried to follow but I didn't think I could safely, and I just, I thought if I could get here, if I could find any of you, you could do something.
You could find something.
You would just, you would hear me and believe me, there's something happening.
I was good at my job.
I was good at my job and then, then they-- I'm still good at my job.
Something's wrong."
-GINA-
How did you escape? Perhaps there's a way for us to get in through where you left.
-AABRIA-
"Scaled the wall.
Normally, you have to pass the director's office and she doesn't seem to sleep.
So for whatever reason, the security, the orderlies, So for whatever reason, the security, the orderlies, there was no one around.
I saw a chance and I took it.
I was good at my job."
-LIAM-
You fled the sanatorium, and she, what, resides there on a permanent basis?
-AABRIA-
"I've never... if she's not walking around, if she's not in a meeting, or viewing the grounds, or she's in her office, always, always." "or she's in her office, always, always."
-ASHLY-
Do they know you're gone? Will they be looking for you?
-AABRIA-
"They have to know.
They have to know."
-NOSHIR-
Don't have much time.
Where did your friend, Johnny, take them?
-AABRIA-
"There's a walking grounds.
It's a large lawn, but there's little copse of trees and shrubbery.
He was running in a dead sprint towards some shrubbery in the back."
-NOSHIR-
What makes him so important?
-AABRIA-
"He was bleeding and he didn't even notice.
He was hurt and didn't care."
-NOSHIR-
Is Johnny a patient there?
-AABRIA-
"Yeah, yeah, one of the ones that disappeared without concern." "one of the ones that disappeared without concern."
-LIAM-
And showed up inexplicably that night and you fled, and you've no idea where they ended up that night.
-AABRIA-
"I had a choice, understand or report, and I'm an officer, I understand authority and structures.
I knew if I could just make someone understand, you could go, I...
If I go back, I'll never leave."
-LIAM-
After listening to this gentleman for several minutes, I'm wondering, does he seem to me confused or like he is omitting anything in his story?
-AABRIA-
Are you using mundane or magical means?
-LIAM-
Mundane, I'm using my bullshit detector.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me a Read roll.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I will burn a drive.
-AABRIA-
Ooh!
-LIAM-
This is gilded, here we go.
Not on the gilded, but that is a six, a success.
-AABRIA-
With a six.
You see that the problem with him isn't anything to do with omission, it's just the thinness.
He came to you with an instinct, a gut feeling that nothing was wrong and that this is a person, you don't really have a sense of how long he's been locked away in the sanatorium, but this is a person that's been convinced steadily over time that his instincts are wrong.
This is a person that lived by his instincts.
Hunches solve cases.
The OUP is a lot like Candela.
They're the part of The Periphery here in the city that engages with magical phenomena, much in the same way that you are about finding, cataloging, suppressing and moving forward.
This is the part of The Periphery, the police state here, that will do whatever it takes to protect the populace from magical problems.
to protect the populace from magical problems.
The relationship between Candela and them is occasionally amicable, but mostly they try to beat you to the punch so they can take credit for all these goings on.
Candela will take control of something and hide it and not necessarily share information with the public.
But anything that gets through this office to The Periphery gets to the Triumvirate and becomes more information for the government to understand, to control, to weaponize.
-LIAM-
Understood, and this gentleman, while a bit in a spin does not seem muddled in his story--
-AABRIA-
Not at all.
-LIAM-
-- and has absolute conviction in it.
-AABRIA-
100%.
-LIAM-
Yes?
-AABRIA-
He seems bolstered by the strong reaction with Rajan.
Someone understands, even that little bit of confirmation is enough.
You see him returning to himself in real time.
-ASHLY-
A question.
-AABRIA-
Yeah?
-ASHLY-
I'm a blood and guts doctor, but is there anything that I've done since I've been with Candela that might help someone, like can I feel that I took a point of bleed basically, that this guy might need some help? Do I have anything that helps with that or am I just your standard issue GP?
-AABRIA-
I think what you are getting off of him, that mixture of like, there's nothing physically wrong with him.
The closest you can get is that understanding of taking bleed, being in proximity to something that is throwing off a lot of that negative energy has affected him.
From your time, and your studies, and your existence as a doctor in this city, you know that the sanatorium is where they put Periphery officers that have been too close to very bad things for too long and get burnt out of efficacy, in the same way that a Candela Lightkeeper is someone that has been in the field for so long that they've aggregated too much scarring on their body, or their mind, or that thing within them that engages with and understands the magical truth of the world.
-ASHLY-
So there's nothing I could do to help him with the feelings that he's having?
-AABRIA-
Talking, believing him, like there's nothing physically--
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- that you could do.
-GINA-
Madam Glask leans over to him in a very reassuring voice and says: You are indeed very good at your job.
-AABRIA-
"Thank you."
-GINA-
Is there anything else that you could tell us that may help us with this Sister Iovar?
-AABRIA-
"Yeah, yeah, we keep tabs on a lot of things, and in our line of work," and now you see that he's a little more bought in on the 'we are the same.' He's no longer treating you as this neophyte that was thrown in his way as another act of dismissal.
"Religion is a vector through which a lot of misdeeds get into the world, so we keep tabs on The Ascendancy.
so we keep tabs on The Ascendancy.
There aren't many clergymen in the city.
I've never heard of an Iovar before.
I don't know, I don't know what she is, and I think that's the thing that bothers me.
She doesn't feel real in the way that you and I are real.
I wish I had more.
Everything was taken when they sent me here."
-GINA-
I understand, that's more than enough, thank you.
-LIAM-
I would open it up to the circle then to brainstorm.
-NOSHIR-
Brainstorm?
-LIAM-
My instinct is to start with the outside and work our way in, unless anyone has a better idea.
Perhaps we wait until nightfall?
-NOSHIR-
Why are we waiting? Professor, with all due respect, we know that Grayslate is where this is happening.
We know that Sister Iovar was last seen there.
Why are we, why are we waiting?
-LIAM-
Hopefully to get in and out unscathed.
-SAM-
Can't we just make an appointment or something? I mean they're open for business, right? You guys are prominent citizens.
-LIAM-
I'm just curious to see if there is anything left on the premises from your associate who fled before charging into the maw of the beast.
-ASHLY-
The stories about the sanatorium is that they don't let people out.
-NOSHIR-
No.
-SAM-
They can let people in, right, to visit?
-ASHLY-
There's something really wrong going on there.
We don't want to just rush in.
-LIAM-
What do you think, Rajan? Should we be charging up to the door and making an appointment with this sister?
-AABRIA-
Rajan.
-LIAM-
Seems like that might be a bad idea.
-AABRIA-
Rajan, you feel the eyes of this circle turn to you, but in this moment, you didn't hear any word after "maw." You fall into yourself.
You're going to take a bleed for remaining here, as a poor reward for your bravery.
You think back.
You were so young.
No one would blame you for the things that happened.
Your sister, after your mother went, after something inside of her broke, Atheka, she was lost to you, she was lost to your family.
And how could you blame her? You were grieving.
So then when a beautiful nun, Rahema, appeared offered you solace, offered you hope, you and your father and the broken family that you were left with took it as a blessing, as a boon.
Over time, she flourished, and you thought it was going so well.
You feel yourself jumping through time, feeling that hope that maybe you could get back to a place where your family could feel okay, could feel good again.
Then you get to that night and you followed across the city, to the dingiest, darkest part of town, and you saw her there on her hands and knees, feverishly digging down deep into the ground.
She looked up at you, and for a while you didn't see your sister.
You saw something ravenous and in rapture.
You saw Rahema, and everything that came after she turned into something monstrous, something fierce.
She attacked you.
She hurt you.
In a moment, you did your best to save yourself.
A poem, a nursery rhyme, drilled into you by your mother whose shape, the lack of her, shattered your family.
You thought, "I have the words to drive back this monster," like they do in a fairytale.
And a slip of the word, and you saved only yourself.
Your sister was lost to a thing that you understand, even as it hit and cleaved deeply between muscle and bone til you could feel it scratch lung, heart, til you could feel it scratch lung, heart, the very core of you.
The Maw, a monster hiding behind a beautiful face.
She's taken your sister and left you like whatever you are now.
But she's back, which means hope is back.
So you accept the bleed greedily, because if you are built for anything, it's this.
You come back to yourself and see that your circle, that this officer is staring you down, expecting some sort of response.
-LIAM-
Rajan?
-NOSHIR-
(sighs) (clears throat contemplatively) I think perhaps there's an easier strategy here.
Madam Glask, do you perhaps have any sway Madam Glask, do you perhaps have any sway over these security personnel at this sanatorium? over these security personnel at this sanatorium?
-GINA-
I suppose I may have heard a few clients talk about guarding the place.
I believe I remember what their names were.
I may know them.
If they happen to be there tonight, I suppose I can pull a few strings to get us in.
Discreetly, though.
-NOSHIR-
If not, greed is always a powerful motivator.
Either way, I think we have our in.
-LIAM-
Right.
What will you do with yourself?
-AABRIA-
"If I show my face, they'll find me.
"If I show my face, they'll find me, the Periphery.
I was put away, so."
-ASHLY-
Glask, you're known for your secrecy.
Maybe we should take this gentleman there.
-NOSHIR-
I think perhaps Nokari might be a good resource here.
The collateral damage if they come after Sarkis is high.
-AABRIA-
"I have other information about what my office has been working on, I think.
I think I can make a deal.
Barter for safe passage out of the city or--"
-LIAM-
I think that wise.
No offense, but I think your presence has an ill effect.
Otherwise, I would offer a room here or suggest Madam Glask's establishment.
I don't think that that's a good idea.
-AABRIA-
"I understand.
It's not personal."
-LIAM-
No.
-AABRIA-
"New start.
I have a lot of memories here, family I can't go home to."
-NOSHIR-
Perhaps I might be able to help.
I have property on Briar Green.
It's unoccupied.
Perhaps you could lay low there for a while.
-SAM-
You have an extra house?
-GINA-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Look at his jacket."
-NOSHIR-
You don't?
-GINA-
(laughs)
I do apologize, it is a place of business and I normally would, especially if Cosmo asks, but I can't risk it.
-AABRIA-
"Oh, yeah.
No, I understand.
You're all being very, very kind.
I appreciate that you believe me at all.
I hope you find something.
I hope you help them figure out whatever's going on.
But you believed me and that feels really good.
So."
-NOSHIR-
Rajan takes a hand out of his jacket pocket, gloved, and gently takes Mr. Sarkis' hand and rubs with his thumb very soothingly across the top.
You'll be well taken care of.
I promise you that.
-AABRIA-
You feel, even in that, and it's very apparent to everyone here, that even in that act of tenderness and gentleness there is a sting that you would recognize there is a sting that you would recognize as someone else resonating at that frequency of proximity as someone else resonating at that frequency of proximity to the Maw and the collateral damage from when you get too close.
But you shrug through it.
-NOSHIR-
I'm waiting to see if the scarlet I've smeared across the back of his hand has taken effect.
-AABRIA-
Oh. Oh! Hmm. Why don't you give me a Hide roll to see-- Let's just see how effective you are.
-LIAM-
You're a slick son of a bitch.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-GINA-
That's really good.
-NOSHIR-
I'm going to add two drive.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-SAM-
Two drive.
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
I will say, the stakes aren't necessarily high here, but this will be less about hiding this from Sarkis, but this will be less about hiding this from Sarkis, who's leaned in and locked in, and more about the people here.
-NOSHIR-
Mm.
(sighs) Critical success on gilded.
-SAM-
Ooh! (impressed exhales)
-AABRIA-
What an act of tenderness.
You see Sarkis begin to relax.
He doesn't even know that it has anything to do with a chemical agent.
He thinks that maybe just being believed and understood and perhaps being touch starved from months and months of isolation, that that was all he ever really needed.
You see him surge up, both relaxed, but that renewed confidence of someone who believes that there's hope, a way through.
who believes that there's hope, a way through, that maybe he's not grayed out, maybe he's not useless.
I think you have a little bit of an understanding.
I would never presume to tell you how your character feels, but you know intimately well the trajectory and duration of that false hope, of that elation that comes from scarlet.
-NOSHIR-
Rest untroubled, friend.
You've done your duty.
-AABRIA-
"(sighs) Thanks. Yeah.
Thank you. I will speak more with the Lightkeeper and we'll figure something out.
Be careful, if you're going at night.
Just be careful.
It's a hospital, but whatever rot got inside it, it's not a good place.
Not just because of the nun or the director.
Not just because of the nun or the director.
I think it's been wrong and rotten for far longer." "I think it's been wrong and rotten for far longer."
-LIAM-
I pull a pencil and paper from a pouch that hangs in inside my wheelchair and hand to him.
Why don't you do me a favor, son, and draw me a basic map Why don't you do me a favor, son, and draw me a basic map to the director and the sister's quarters.
-AABRIA-
"Yes." Given a task and something that he is very good at, Given a task and something that he is very good at, it takes maybe a minute.
He's not an artist, but it's very clear.
You have a top down layout of as much of the interior You have a top down layout of as much of the interior of the sanatorium as a patient will be granted access to.
So there's large blocks and swaths and floors that he has no information on.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
But that bottom floor, mapped perfectly down to windows and the grounds.
mapped perfectly down to windows and the grounds.
Three distinct sections of trees, and a little fountain, and the shrubbery that abuts the far wall that makes it that much harder to clear and escape.
-LIAM-
Why don't you add an X to where your fellow patient ran to? to where your fellow patient ran to?
-AABRIA-
Because he does not know where they stopped, he'll give you a dotted straight line--
-LIAM-
Trajectory.
-AABRIA-
-- of the straight trajectory.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
It's very clear that whatever that run was, there was no sense of follow the garden path.
It's a straight shot towards-- There's a central little tree lined area with some benches and then the far corner where there's some tree line, too.
So you have two potential places.
-LIAM-
Hopefully this will make our work ever so slightly easier.
-AABRIA-
"I'm happy to have helped."
-LIAM-
Remind me, GM, did the Lightkeeper leave premises?
-AABRIA-
Yes, they did.
-LIAM-
Yes. All right.
So you are going to check in with Nokari?
-AABRIA-
"Mm-hmm."
-LIAM-
All right.
-AABRIA-
"The way I understand it, this is not their chapter house."
-LIAM-
No.
-AABRIA-
"It's daytime.
I might lie low for a little longer, but I can make my way over.
The Steel is easy to navigate when it was your beat. (laughs) I'll be okay."
-NOSHIR-
Is Eloise still here?
-AABRIA-
You-- Above game, I don't think you have any reason to believe that she would have departed.
But if Rajan asked out loud, you just get a blank stare back from Silva.
He goes like, "Who?"
-SAM-
She should still be, yeah.
-LIAM-
Eloise?
-NOSHIR-
Yes, Professor.
-LIAM-
She minds the shop.
-NOSHIR-
Sarkis cannot be left alone here.
If the Ascendancy were to find him, what do you think will happen? We will never see him again.
More importantly, you know he must be observed.
-LIAM-
I might agree with that, doctor, but he seems to be having a serious effect on you.
I hate to see you stretched.
-SAM-
Also, not to be rude, but what do we care? We've got a mission, we've got a place, we've got a time, we've got a person.
I might have misjudged this whole Candela thing.
I mean, going after a sex-crazed nun kind of sounds fun now.
What do we need this guy anymore for? He gave us his info.
-AABRIA-
"Well."
-NOSHIR-
A sex-crazed nun.
Maybe you're right, Oscar.
Maybe it's not such a big deal after all.
-ASHLY-
Can I see-- I don't want to know.
I know that I wouldn't have noticed what he smeared on Silva.
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLY-
But I want to see if I can notice traces of scarlet use on Rajan as he's speaking.
-AABRIA-
Oh.
Give me a Read roll.
-ASHLY-
Can it be a Focus?
-SAM-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Yeah. You know what? Go ahead and make it a Focus roll. Love that.
(laughter)
Love that.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to spend a drive because I'll use a gilded.
I have a gilded baby in here.
Mm, that is a mixed success.
-AABRIA-
Uh-huh.
There is something to his pallor and presentation, There is something to his pallor and presentation, exacerbated by whatever you saw him fall into exacerbated by whatever you saw him fall into as he's been out here in proximity with this man.
Scarlet could explain it, but there's a lot of reasons that someone could look this way, look this drawn.
You feel it inside of you too, that wrongness, something scratching into you because of your proximity to this person.
-SAM-
Scarlet is a drug?
-AABRIA-
Scarlet is the predominant drug here.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
And has lots of different ways it pops up.
It's often mixed into alcohol and used for social things.
It's often mixed into alcohol and used for social things.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
But yeah, across the board.
-LIAM-
I'll tell you, Rajan, I was primarily concerned for you, son.
But I want the machine that is this circle to be well-oiled.
If you would feel more comfortable with him taking one of the rooms upstairs until Eloise can get word to Nokari, I can abide by that.
Would that ease your mind?
-NOSHIR-
Yes, Professor, thank you.
It's much appreciated.
-LIAM-
We are all friends here, son. We are friends.
-AABRIA-
With that, with a sort of understanding of the when and the how of it, plans to sneak out tonight to broach the grounds, to find for yourself, we're going to cut as you wait out the day.
You are able to make plans with Eloise who is, though she is drawn and skittish and very averse to picking up even bits and hints of your work with Candela now that she's out, she is capable and babysitting one man is an easy enough task to set her to, though she asks for as few details as possible.
-LIAM-
She was one of the sharpest agents in the field when she was still in the game.
I have no doubt in her.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
Before we fast forward too much, could I have a scene with Raj?
-AABRIA-
Love it. Go ahead and paint me a picture.
-LIAM-
I'll follow up afterward.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
So I think at this point that Silva has been-- escorted upstairs.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, off and away.
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to find a moment when Raj is alone and approach him.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you have hours until night falls.
-ASHLY-
Mm-hmm.
Raj?
-NOSHIR-
Elsie.
-ASHLY-
(sighs)
-NOSHIR-
Oh, I know that look. Ever the good doctor.
-ASHLY-
You seem a bit worse for the wear.
I wondered if I might (breathes shakily) do a brief examination to make sure everything's okay.
-NOSHIR-
What? Are you worried about me, Elsie?
-ASHLY-
I'm a doctor, it's my job.
-NOSHIR-
Yes.
I think I'm doing quite fine on my own, but I promise I will be a very good patient.
If I need you, I'll come running.
-ASHLY-
Doing fine on your own, and yet you joined this group.
How long have you been tracking this? What are you going to do if you don't find her?
-NOSHIR-
Ever full of doubts, Elsie.
-ASHLY-
I was given reason--
-NOSHIR-
Let's not worry about a problem that hasn't arised yet, yes? I don't need you looking after me right now.
-ASHLY-
Did you know I was going to be here?
-NOSHIR-
Complete surprise.
-ASHLY-
Hmm.
-NOSHIR-
I must say, though, it is very good to see you.
-ASHLY-
I wish I could say the same.
-NOSHIR-
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
I'm going to turn to leave unless he wants to stop me for a second.
-AABRIA-
He lets you leave, and something in that, the confrontation of it, the coldness of it.
Take another token.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-ASHLY-
♪ Oh, we're halfway there ♪
-NOSHIR-
On second thought-- No.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Hug her and tell her whatever's happening is fine.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Is there anything else you want to do before we get to the sanatorium?
-SAM-
I'll walk over--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
-- to wherever he is.
-LIAM-
In my study.
Close the door.
-SAM-
Oh, I had to-- Okay, sure.
-LIAM-
You find me with my back to you and Godot in my lap, staring at the painting on the wall behind my desk.
Piles of books and charts everywhere, sketches of strange Oldfairen architecture, symbols you can't read.
You look well, boy.
Like you always do, you look well.
-SAM-
I feel fine, yeah.
How about you? I mean, you know, you don't have to do this anymore.
I'm sure you've been told enough, but--
-LIAM-
Don't I-- Your time inside wasn't too harsh, I hope.
-SAM-
I mean, prison's a lot like every day.
I mean, prison's a lot like every day.
Same routine, just smaller walls, fewer windows.
I would've been fine.
You didn't have to pull strings and bust me out.
I would've been fine.
-LIAM-
Well, old habits and all that.
-SAM-
Yeah, you're always taking care of me.
(sighs) I appreciate it.
I just, I think it should be the other way around.
-LIAM-
Listen to me.
Believe it or not, I am glad to have you close.
I am trepidatious.
I don't know what to make of Dr. Savarimuthu and this man's coincidental overlap.
and this man's coincidental overlap.
I don't know what that means, but I do know that there will be eyes on us, Oscar.
I do know that there will be eyes on us, Oscar.
He hasn't looked at you once this whole time and finally turns.
There will be eyes on you.
-SAM-
I can take it.
I'll just be as subtle as I can be.
Look, if we get in a scrape, just stay behind me, okay? You don't need to be doing anything brave or bold.
You've done plenty, all right? Just take it easy.
We'll help these people out, help the prince out, or whatever his name is, go home, rest, and be done with it.
I know you want this to be more than just one of your regular missions, but I've stopped trying.
-LIAM-
Time is a funny thing.
Always wanting more, never enough.
Or is it too much? Is it too much time? Try not to rock the boat with the circle.
That young man is a good boy at his core.
-SAM-
Yeah, he seemed like he cared.
That's a good thing, I guess.
Still, I mean, come on, look at him.
-AABRIA-
(laughs quietly)
-SAM-
(sighs) I'll do my best, all right, Cosmo?
-LIAM-
Not all of us have played <i>baseball</i> down by the docks.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
We all walk different walks in this life.
-SAM-
Well, I hope it's a grand bam.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
That's an inside joke just for us.
(laughter)
Listen--
-SAM-
Listen. I got to go.
I got to go, I got to go, my boss is out there.
-GINA-
Oscar.
-SAM-
I got to go. I got to go.
-LIAM-
Yes, you beat me to it.
Madam Glask does not suffer fools. Go, go, go, go.
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-GINA-
Time is of the essence.
-SAM-
Eat something before we go tonight, all right?
-LIAM-
I hold up my wiener dog.
Oh, you have been eating fish.
-SAM-
No, no. Food.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Get Eloise to get you some-- All right, I'm out of here.
Is there anything else you want to cover before you head out?
I want to break into a sanatorium.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
-LIAM-
It's minor, but once Oscar departs, Cosmo spends the hours of the day poring through any books in his collection that discuss the history of the Ascendancy, dating all the way back to the War of Embers and looking for anything that sounds like this woman Iovar, and finds nothing.
-AABRIA-
She is a tidy blank in your copious research.
She is a tidy blank in your copious research.
-LIAM-
I had to try.
-AABRIA-
As you focus and fixate, doing what you do best in the field, which is know and understand and catalog and process, the hours slip away, and the sun moves across the sky, and at some point, you look up and night has settled over the Sidle and over Newfaire and night has settled over the Sidle and over Newfaire and it's time to go.
-LIAM-
The witching hour.
-AABRIA-
And we'll get to that after our break.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-NOSHIR-
(laughs)
-GINA-
Woo!
-AABRIA-
Woo! (laughs) We'll see you in a bit!

-AABRIA-
And after a day of preparation and thought, and conversations, you find yourselves standing in the street, looking up at the imposing dark gray structure that is the Grayslate Sanatorium.
It's been around for a couple centuries and any historical understanding of it and any historical understanding of it as a place of genuine convalescence and healing has given way to the understanding that it's where the rich hide away the family members that embarrass them, and largely, the Periphery uses it as a convenient dumping ground for their soldiers who have seen a little too much for their soldiers who have seen a little too much and are holding a little too much, and are no longer of use.
I think there's something in the brutal structure of it.
I think there's something in the brutal structure of it.
There's nothing calm or kind or sympathetic to a person at their lowest, most vulnerable, that you see, that yeah, this reads more like a fortress to keep things in than a place to heal and help.
As you look, you see maybe every two to three minutes, a guard in a dark gray jumpsuit that blends in with the wall if they ever go still to observe or listen in to the other side of the walls, makes their pathway around.
You're all hidden out of sight, it's night.
How do you make your way in? What's the plan?
-SAM-
With all due respect to all you guys: Your Highness, Madam, Doc, Cosmo.
This is sort of my bag, so if you wouldn't mind, maybe I can go out there and sneak around and see if I can get eyes on that guard that you know.
-GINA-
Sure, about 6'4", a dark mustache, a scar over his right eye.
-SAM-
That's me, you're talking about me.
(laughter)
-GINA-
6'4?
-SAM-
Well, I mean, okay.
I think I've seen him, though, at-- He's a customer, right? I think I've seen him around.
-GINA-
Yes, if you can get eyes on him, I can possibly ask him to let us in.
-SAM-
All right.
-LIAM-
So we're staying away from the front gates.
The entrance we're coming in on the side?
-SAM-
Maybe I should scurry up over.
Are these solid stone walls or cast iron?
-AABRIA-
So you're looking at a poured concrete and brick construction, but there's just enough of crenulation and decoration that there are footholds at least from the outside.
-SAM-
All right, I don't think I need a boost or anything, but I think I can make it up and peer over the top.
-ASHLY-
Be careful.
-SAM-
Thanks, Doc. If I fall, I know who's going to patch me up, right? (laughter)
Let's go.
-AABRIA-
Okay, you time it so the passing of the guard
Okay, you time it so the passing of the guard gives you your biggest clearance.
You have maybe a minute before someone will turn around a corner and if you're not high enough, you'll be spotted.
So give me, let's call it a Move roll, unless you want to make a case for something else.
-SAM-
No, Move sounds good.
Is it to get to the top of the--?
-AABRIA-
Yep, cleanly, quickly and quietly.
-SAM-
I will use a drive.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I will say the stakes on this are high not for harm, but for getting there unperceived, not for harm, but for getting there unperceived, either visually or auditorily.
-ASHLY-
I was going to say: Could I potentially be sort of--
-SAM-
Boosty?
-ASHLY-
Not boosty, but if you were to drop something that might make a sound or something, I want to be at the ready to maybe catch.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're all very aware that-- you've gotten a sense of the timing, so you can get in there, help as much as you can, and then get out of Dodge before--
-ASHLY-
Does that mean I add a drive to his?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-SAM-
Oh, so I get another dice, amazing.
-AABRIA-
Do you want to jump in on this?
-NOSHIR-
I'm wondering if perhaps it's worth it for Madam Glask and I to create a little commotion somewhere to draw a little bit of attention.
-SAM-
Oh boy. We're trying to do this sneaky.
You sure about that?
-NOSHIR-
Oh, I mean away from you.
-SAM-
Sure, sure.
-NOSHIR-
No, I'll let the professional handle this.
(laughter)
-GINA-
Oh, I was hoping we could have some fun.
-SAM-
We'll find out.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-SAM-
Four, that's a mixed success.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
How important is it to you--
-ASHLY-
Uh-oh.
-AABRIA-
-- to get up undetected? If you have to choose between success or harm to yourself, what do you choose?
-SAM-
Oh, success.
-AABRIA-
You scurry up, moving quickly and impressively quietly, and you have a spotter.
The Doc is under you ready to catch anything, to make sure you're soundless and you can feel it as you are picking all of your handholds and your footholds, there's something so hostile about the architecture that you feel your hand grabbing onto not smooth stone worn down by time, but it's almost as if it's been sanded or polished, so it hurts to hold.
You feel your hands ripping as you go, and it takes everything in you to wipe your shirt or your coat over the spot so you're not leaving bloody hand prints.
Please take a body.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
-ASHLY-
Shit.
-SAM-
Ah, that hurt, but I'm here.
-ASHLY-
Are you okay?
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nothing you can't fix, maybe.
You brought bandages, right?
-ASHLY-
Yes, I brought bandages, Oscar.
-SAM-
I'll peer over and see what I can see.
-AABRIA-
What you see is all of the decoration from the outside absolutely stops when you get on the inside.
You're about 16 feet in the air, and the sloped architecture that gives very gothic vibes falls away into a dead drop of intensely slick, polished stone that would provide no purchase on the other side for you to jump and come back.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-AABRIA-
But what you see-- Sorry, mic.
What you see is this flat, wide area of grass, maybe a hundred yards in every direction.
maybe a hundred yards in every direction.
A big square with a couple little pockets of trees.
To call them copses or little natural spots of shrubbery is a gross exaggeration and I think you have a strong sense of what becomes normal after a while, given how stark everything is in here.
You can count the number of trees on your fingers and toes and yeah, you've got eyes on the two areas highlighted by the map provided.
There's nothing visually that you can clock, but that central copse 50 yards to get there and then the tree edge, that would've been the other side of that diagonal that Johnny ran, would be probably skirting the outside.
It would take you maybe 120 yards to walk the edges and get over there.
-SAM-
Can I ID any of the guards walking around or see anyone coming?
-AABRIA-
I think we can walk that back and say that if you were trying to get the timing of the guards, you would have seen your mark, Cronin, making the rounds.
It takes him probably 20 minutes to do the full lap.
So the fact that you were seeing someone every couple of minutes means that there's five or six guards on duty.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
I will whisper all that back down to the Doc.
What do we do?
-LIAM-
What's it like at the front gate because I'm not going over the wall?
-AABRIA-
You have seconds to have this conversation before another one comes around.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to say: Just get down, get down for now.
-SAM-
I could throw a rock or--
-ASHLY-
Oscar, get down.
-SAM-
All right, all right, I'll get down.
It's just, they're so punchable, all right.
-ASHLY-
As soon as you get down, I'm going to take your hands and look at them.
-SAM-
It's fine, It's just a cut, it's fine.
-ASHLY-
I thought you were tougher than this.
-SAM-
I am.
-ASHLY-
Apparently not.
Then when I have a few moments of calm, I can make a Focus roll to heal one body mark on an ally.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-SAM-
Oh wow.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-SAM-
Don't waste that on me.
-NOSHIR-
I agree.
(laughter)
Kidding, kidding.
-ASHLY-
Who are you?
-SAM-
All right, so we know where-- Oh, do you have to roll for it?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
I do.
-AABRIA-
What'd you get?
-ASHLY-
On a four or a five, spend two intuition to accomplish this.
So one of them was a gilded die, so I'll get rid of one drive, and you get your body healed.
-AABRIA-
Did you take the result from your gilded die?
-ASHLY-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay, cool, cool, sweet.
-ASHLY-
Better?
-SAM-
Yeah, thank you.
-ASHLY-
Sure.
-SAM-
You doing okay?
-ASHLY-
(exhales) I'm, uh--
-NOSHIR-
Time is of the essence, people.
-SAM-
Sorry, sorry, yeah.
Okay, I saw the trees where we're going.
It's in there to the left, but there's lots of guards.
I think we're going to need some sort of distraction to get there.
-GINA-
I know one.
So you did see Cronin?
-SAM-
He's making the rounds, but so are a half dozen others.
-GINA-
Five others.
-ASHLY-
Well.
-LIAM-
What about the front entrance?
-SAM-
What did I see in the front entrance?
-AABRIA-
You looked-- So you popped up to look into the back and the lawn.
So I think your best eyes were on the back entrance to the main building.
What you see is, even though this place is very dark and very cold and very stark and not well lit, there's still movement inside.
It's early evening, so it's not like this place is settled down for the night.
But it does feel a little busy and without having to roll, you're street smart, you've got it.
If an inmate escaped, they've heightened patrols, they're on alert because the impossible has happened.
-ASHLY-
Cosmo and I could probably get in, but that's just the two of us.
-GINA-
I can distract them.
They're already on high alert because they've lost an inmate already.
What if we pretend that I just saw another inmate run out.
I'm sure that will--
-SAM-
Get everyone to run to the front gate at least, yeah.
We could do that and slip in while they run out.
-NOSHIR-
But if we put security at the front gate, there's no way the professor's getting over the wall.
-GINA-
To the back, since we're on the side of the back, right? I'll make a commotion on that side, they'll surely have to.
Is there a back gate thing? Oh, it's only the front.
-SAM-
Some of us could climb over while the two of them go in the front door.
I would have brought some rope with us knowing that we are breaking into a place, I would assume.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You can have your fucking rope.
-SAM-
Okay.
(laughter)
So some of us can go over the wall while these two go in the front.
-GINA-
I can escort you to the front or I can go with you to the front.
-ASHLY-
They might need you for--
-NOSHIR-
Oh good.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Are you okay at climbing, or--?
-GINA-
Because how am I going to climb that?
-NOSHIR-
I think I'll manage.
-SAM-
Will the slippers slip?
-AABRIA-
Oh!
-NOSHIR-
I think I'll be okay.
After all, I'm with a professional.
-ASHLY-
Are you two going to be okay on your own?
-NOSHIR-
Oh, absolutely.
-SAM-
Absolutely.
-AABRIA-
You got to take a token; that stressed me out.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
Convincing.
Well, Cosmo?
-LIAM-
Well, what's our story going in?
-ASHLY-
Well, we talked about this a little bit, I forgot, off-camera-- (laughter)
-- for the viewers.
I've dressed as if I'm working at the sanatorium, and you are prepared to act uncouth?
-LIAM-
That's easy, I'm just wondering about the first moments in the gate if there's anyone there.
Are we returning me from treatment?
-GINA-
My father has been so sick lately and now he's acting out of control and I don't know what to do! Please help him.
-SAM-
Like you're committing him.
-ASHLY-
She's pretty good.
-LIAM-
Yes, grandfather, though, probably.
-GINA-
Oh, grandfather.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Hey, you could have-- Hmm.
-GINA-
49.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
What happens when we get inside?
-ASHLY-
We might just have to make a beeline for the director's office.
I don't know if we're going to be able to get these two in.
-SAM-
We'll check out the outside, the copse of trees or whatever and depending on what we find, we can try to find you afterwards.
Rendezvous either inside at the office if it's easy or back outside the gate.
-LIAM-
You're just going to make a run for it? What about this man?
-SAM-
Man?
-GINA-
Is there any way I can, once we're inside, I can break away from you two and cause a commotion to distract the guards for them to climb over?
-SAM-
We'll be okay.
-GINA-
Yeah?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
You sure?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-NOSHIR-
Nothing ventured.
-ASHLY-
Fine, we'll go through the front.
-LIAM-
So we're just going to make a cold call to the director's office?
-ASHLY-
I don't know about cold.
Where on the map is the director's office?
-AABRIA-
20 feet from the front.
There's a little intake, reception desk and then, yeah, 20 feet back, massive office on the left.
-ASHLY-
If you two keep moving deeper into the sanatorium, and make a commotion like you said, I can try to slip into the director's office and see what I can find.
-LIAM-
Yes, and I will demand the director vociferously in the halls, and then you'll slip in.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Yes, I'll make a stink.
-ASHLY-
If I call for you, it's happening.
So just get them out.
-NOSHIR-
No one's leaving you alone in there, Elsie.
-ASHLY-
I'll be fine.
Let's go.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
All right.
We move from there to all the pieces in place.
You two at the back, still with that perfect timing of the guard's rotation.
It seems uninterrupted.
Now that you've had a couple more minutes while you're waiting for the rest of your circle to get in place, you see that even the pauses to knock some dirt off of a shoe or to scratch a back, they're all timed perfectly.
This is a feigned casualness, but they're staying in perfect sync with one another.
All of this is to affect a lack of concern, though you are absolutely certain that they are on high alert right now.
So you wait for your moment, and slip up and in and we'll cut to that.
The three of you walk through the front door, rolling, raving.
What does it look like?
-LIAM-
I don't know what you put in me.
-GINA-
No!
-LIAM-
What did you put in me?
-GINA-
Careful! I just don't know how--
-ASHLY-
Both of you--
-GINA-
-- to handle him anymore.
-ASHLY-
I'm sorry.
-LIAM-
I want to speak--
-GINA-
Please, help us.
-LIAM-
-- to who's in charge!
-ASHLY-
It was a mild sedative.
-LIAM-
It's not you!
-ASHLY-
I don't know why it's not taking.
I don't know why it's not taking.
-GINA-
Ever since his wife left him, he hasn't been the same.
-LIAM-
You're a bitch! What did you put in me?
-GINA-
No! You can't say that.
-LIAM-
What?
-ASHLY-
You need to keep your voice down, sir.
-GINA-
Oh my goodness gracious.
-LIAM-
I don't trust it.
I don't trust you!
-GINA-
(hysterical moans)
-ASHLY-
Can you control your grandfather, please?
-GINA-
Grandfather, please--
-LIAM-
I want to speak to the man or woman in charge!
-GINA-
Who's in charge?
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You move into this lobby, mid spin-up, and you see a receptionist that almost seemed to be dozing with a paperback book over their chest, snaps to attention.
A couple of orderlies, just normal people, they don't look particularly burly or intimidating, filter in from the sides, running up the halls to meet you with your energy.
You see this woman leans forward.
"I'm-- Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry. Sir?"
-LIAM-
You're not real.
-AABRIA-
"Sir."
-LIAM-
You're not real.
-GINA-
I don't know what to do anymore.
-LIAM-
You're not a real person.
-AABRIA-
"Sir!"
-GINA-
It's just so (hysterical speech)
-ASHLY-
Her grandfather needs to be admitted.
I've given him a sedative, it is not taking effect.
-LIAM-
She put something in me!
-AABRIA-
"Okay."
-ASHLY-
He's demanding to speak--
-GINA-
(sobs)
-LIAM-
(sharp groan)
-ASHLY-
-- to a director.
-LIAM-
I want to speak to who's in charge!
-ASHLY-
It might help calm him--
-LIAM-
Someone real!
-ASHLY-
-- if you could get your director, please.
-GINA-
Grandfather, please!
-AABRIA-
"Sir."
-LIAM-
I want to speak to someone real.
-AABRIA-
"I'm in charge.
My name is Kathleen, and I'm here to help."
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
I want someone real! Get me someone real!
-ASHLY-
Kathleen, look at me, this has been happening for 45 minutes.
I need you to get your director here now.
-LIAM-
You put some sort of drug in me!
-GINA-
It was nothing, Grandfather!
-LIAM-
I don't trust it.
-ASHLY-
Kathleen.
-GINA-
I just need you to go to sleep.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah."
-ASHLY-
He will become violent soon.
Now, your director, please.
-LIAM-
It burns. It burns!
-GINA-
So violent!
-AABRIA-
Give me a Sway.
-LIAM-
Give me someone real!
-GINA-
Ever so violent!
-SAM-
Come on!
-ASHLY-
Shit, I don't have any Sway.
-AABRIA-
Give me a Sway roll.
But I will say that the stakes of this, of being able to call down the manager is much simpler now because of the cacophony, and the way you've presented yourself and that calm command of, hey you, you specifically, you can do this. Yeah.
-LIAM-
I'm burning a drive in Cunning to help sway by screaming like a lunatic! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
(screams) Yeah.
-ASHLY-
Does that mean-- I have no Sway, so does that mean two?
-AABRIA-
So you're at one now.
-ASHLY-
I'm at one now.
-SAM-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Oh, I burn two.
-GINA-
I want to give her another one.
-ASHLY-
Oh, you're going to give me more?
-GINA-
I'll give her one.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Okay, one and one
-LIAM-
No, two from me.
-AABRIA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-ASHLY-
Okay, so three?
-AABRIA-
You're at three.
-SAM-
Add one from Gina.
-ASHLY-
So three?
-AABRIA-
Three total.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
Oh, I got two sixes.
-LIAM-
Critical! Critical!
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Holy shit!
-SAM-
Wait, because they helped-- Oh wait, they don't get their drive back.
-AABRIA-
They don't get their drive back.
-ASHLY-
Oh shit! (laughter)
-AABRIA-
You have to be bad at things, and this was the opposite of that.
Now, I think there's a moment where you realize this plan is psychotic and if there's any hole in it, you know everyone's on alert, you know that this could fall apart if it's not bought in.
But your comrades are good at what they do.
You see on your right, Madam Glask has dissolved into sobbing tears and is feigning that level of like I might faint.
The orderlies are like, we are in place to catch her, what's happening? Cosmo, losing his mind.
-AABRIA-
You are the point of order, and you words shoot through all of the noise and hit Kathleen perfectly.
It's a problem she can fix.
All she has to do is go get the director.
She says, "Yes, doctor, I'll be right back."
-ASHLY-
Quickly, please!
-AABRIA-
"Going."
-GINA-
Please, quickly.
-AABRIA-
She pushes away from the desk and runs down the hall and you see her I immediately bank left to where you know the director's office is, and she knocks on the door banging on it.
Then you see her correct herself, now like: Okay, I don't have to have the energy you have and it switches to a knock, opens the door, and you can't hear what she's saying, but you know she's having a hushed conversation with someone on the other side.
-LIAM-
This is a bloody mummers' show!
-AABRIA-
While this is happening, is there anything you're trying to scope now that you're inside with a clear view and the heat's kind of off you?
-ASHLY-
My hope is that we would successfully get the director out.
They would keep the ruckus up, and then I would (schloop)
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Sweet.
-ASHLY-
That's me sneaking.
That's what that was.
-AABRIA-
I was just seeing if you're going to scan anything while you're waiting to see the resolution on this.
-ASHLY-
If I was trying to see anything--
-AABRIA-
Yeah, trying to-- You have a moment to scan things without looking, without being noticed for casing a joint.
-ASHLY-
I suppose I should, since you're asking.
That would be a Survey, I'm guessing?
-AABRIA-
Just give me an idea of what you're looking for.
And that's for all three of you.
-ASHLY-
I want to make sure--
-AABRIA-
You have a moment.
-ASHLY-
-- that my path is clear to sneak into the director's office and not raise any suspicion.
I mean they're successfully distracting everyone, but I want to make sure I'm not going to turn a corner and a guard's going to come by and be like, what are you doing?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, from what you can see, all of that busyness and the commotion is way down the corridors and way down the hall towards, you can see pouring in of moonlight, that doors that would lead out into that back area would be.
So it seems like they're back there and then farther again away where the patients are probably being held.
So your way is clear.
Anyone else trying to look for something specific?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I know it's total chaos, but I would like to know if all the people who are rushing around us, they see stuff like this all the time.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
So, do they look really perturbed or upset or is it just business as usual?
-AABRIA-
The three people you've seen, Kathleen, the receptionist, and the two orderlies that have poured out, Kathleen seems by far the most startled.
She's not really actually--
-ASHLY-
Is she new here? (laughs)
-AABRIA-
She doesn't look like she's been around for a while, like oh, it popped off in a way and I don't really know the protocol, which is why she was so eager to align to a point of authority.
The orderlies on the other hand, seasoned professionals, and they're moving closer to you, and waiting, without grabbing you, you're not being manhandled, but you can see that they're on deck if you begin to pop off in the way that the doc warned them.
-LIAM-
I am starting to wheel away from the direction of where Elsie wants to go, trying to draw attention away from--
-SAM-
Oh, smart.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-GINA-
I chase after him.
Grandfather, no no, come back!
-LIAM-
None of you are real.
-GINA-
No, you can't-- But I'm barely running.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
You're not real!
-AABRIA-
You're doing the, I don't know how to run in heels.
-LIAM-
You're not real!
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-GINA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
They're trying to figure out, how the fuck do you get in the way of someone with wheels.
Oh, he's so side to side, curvy agile.
I'm used to a juke.
This is new.
-LIAM-
Bob and weave, serpentine, serpentine!
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (laughter)
So as they're trying to figure out the best way to have coverage on you, you draw them back towards the front door, and now you have space.
You can see Kathleen speaking into the office.
She stands back in a way that would suggest that she's waiting for the director to come out.
So if it is your intention to go in that way, you can head off.
You know that you've got a couple seconds before she emerges.
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
So what do you want to do?
-ASHLY-
Ideally, I would be part of the fracas still until the director is pulled past me, and then when his attention is distracted I would slip in behind them.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Yeah, you wait a couple seconds and you see her emerge.
Director Greenvale is shorter woman, very thin in that way of runners.
There's not a lot of extra flesh to her.
Appears to be in her early 40s, short severe blonde bob, and eyes that you can't really get a read on behind some fairly thick half frames.
She's dressed pristinely.
It's the early evening, but she looks like she's wearing freshly pressed clothes at the top of her day.
She comes out, nods something in confirmation to Kathleen, and then gives her the go ahead.
Kathleen takes off farther down the hall in the other direction and she turns and casually walks your direction.
(Director) "Seems-- (clears throat authoritatively) Seems like we have a little bit of a problem here."
-LIAM-
I'm still waiting!
-GINA-
Oh! We just need help!
-ASHLY-
Please, please, if you could go speak to him please.
-LIAM-
Who are you? Are you real?
-GINA-
We're all real grandfather, please.
-AABRIA-
"Remains to be seen, sir. One second." You see she slides off of you in a way that someone who works with rowdy patients and people in crisis, none of it is hitting her in any emotional way.
She re-locks in on you.
"Are you the one that's going to be committing him, ma'am?"
-ASHLY-
Yes, and transparently, this is-- I'm new to this sort of assignment, so I'm a little frazzled and I was hoping that maybe you could calm him because nothing I'm doing seems to be helping.
-LIAM-
I wheel up. I want-- You're the one, aren't you? I want my room prepared!
-AABRIA-
You get--
-LIAM-
I want a free room! (laughter)
I want a free room!
-GINA-
I grab him. "Grandfather--"
-LIAM-
And I want it to be real!
-GINA-
"It's not a hotel.
It's not a hotel!
-AABRIA-
How close do you get to the director?
-LIAM-
I get right up and I actually tug on her sleeve.
-AABRIA-
The moment you get within melee range, her foot comes up in her skirt and she stops you with the heel, in between your knees on your chair.
She goes, "Sir."
-LIAM-
Yes? Yes.
-AABRIA-
"I'm going to need you to wait a moment.
I'm speaking."
-LIAM-
I want to be in a room.
I want to be in a room away from this one and her tricks!
-GINA-
Oh, how could you? How could you?! He doesn't mean that.
-LIAM-
I want to be put in a room!
-GINA-
I'm his granddaughter, please.
-LIAM-
Right now!
-ASHLY-
I'm so, so sorry.
-GINA-
(hysterical mumbling)
-LIAM-
I don't want to speak to any underlings, or flunkies, or phonies, I want someone real.
-AABRIA-
"Eyes on me."
-LIAM-
(angrily) Ah!
-AABRIA-
"I need you to calm down.
My name is Director Greenvale and I will take care of you.
But nothing good will happen if you continue this way.
Do you understand?"
-LIAM-
My own room?
-AABRIA-
"Yes, your own room." You see her scanning you.
You're nicely dressed and it seems like only after she appraised you did she agree.
"Yes, now can you give us a minute, Mr.--?" "Yes, now can you give us a minute, Mr.--?"
-LIAM-
Ogilvy.
-AABRIA-
"Ogilvy.
Is that of the Ogilvys in Silverslip?"
-LIAM-
No, I'm from the Sidle.
-AABRIA-
"Hmm. Okay, we'll take care of you."
-LIAM-
You are a liar.
-AABRIA-
She's going to try to refocus on you.
So what do you want to do to try to break away from this?
-ASHLY-
I'm going to say: I'm so sorry.
I would love to speak to you about everything that's happened thus far, but I really would like a moment to compose myself if I could.
So if you wouldn't mind please taking him to his room and I will meet you there.
-AABRIA-
"Understood.
I have to-- Okay, I just sent Kathleen off.
That's fine.
I will draw up some intake paperwork.
If you can just hold on here.
Are you the executor of his estate? Can you sign that paperwork or would that be--"
-ASHLY-
That would be her.
-GINA-
That would be me.
-AABRIA-
"Okay."
-GINA-
I'm his granddaughter.
-AABRIA-
"I'll be back with paperwork for you.
Take all the time you need.
There's a powder room down the hall on the right."
-ASHLY-
Thank you very much.
-AABRIA-
She truly just, foot comes down she pushes past you.
There's just a coldness to her as she goes back into her office.
-ASHLY-
Oh, she goes back into the office?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
Fuck!
-GINA-
Oh, I know. Okay.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
I will say, 20 yards away, you see her moving back in that direction to go grab something.
-ASHLY-
I'm just going to be gone--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
-- as if I'm in the powder room.
-AABRIA-
Sweet.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to try to wait to have them all go--
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-GINA-
Before she makes it about 20 yards away--
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-GINA-
(whisper-mumbling character sheet info) Okay.
Madam Glask, as loud as she possibly can, just--
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-GINA-
(wailing) Oh! I can't take this anymore! And faints, just dramatically faints on the ground, furs all over the ground, rings flying out.
-AABRIA-
You land on the ground-- Do you commit to--
-GINA-
Yeah, oh baby yeah, absolutely.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
As you hit, you see the orderlies have moved off of Cosmo and are looking at you, and it's at that moment that you see the swing of the bob as the director peeks back out.
"What now? Fuck!" She comes back out and moves in your direction.
-SAM-
Awesome.
-GINA-
Yes.
-ASHLY-
Are they far enough away that it would be safe for me to go in there?
-AABRIA-
It looks like now everyone's grouped up around these two.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
So they're not even looking back in your direction.
-ASHLY-
Okay, I'm going to--
-AABRIA-
The way is clear.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to get in there then, I guess.
-AABRIA-
So you're diving into the office?
-ASHLY-
Yep, yep, yep.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-ASHLY-
That's what I'm doing.
-AABRIA-
Okay. You slip in.
Do you leave the door ajar? Do you close it? Do you lock it? How committed are you to giving yourself time?
-ASHLY-
Fuck. I think I need to keep it open so that I can hopefully move out quickly if I need to.
-AABRIA-
Fine. Okay.
Then we'll cut to that in a second.
Let's go see what's happening in the back of house.
Gentlemen, what's your plan?
-SAM-
If he can hack it, we'll scale the wall.
Wait 'til there's a break in the guards and dash over into the darkness.
-NOSHIR-
Lead the way.
-AABRIA-
I love all of this energy.
Okay. Your timing is locked in.
I need both of you to make Move rolls to go up.
I will say a slight difference in stakes between the two of you.
A regular roll, regular stakes, because you've seen it done before.
You have a sense of how to get up there, though you may not have a perfect sense of how physically precarious it is to go up.
But because your hands are bandaged, this is going to be a little harder for you.
It will require a full success--
-SAM-
Uh!
-AABRIA-
-- for you to get up in time.
-SAM-
Like a six?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-SAM-
Oh my god!
-ASHLY-
Even though I healed him?
-NOSHIR-
This is on a--
-AABRIA-
I mean you, did you use magick to heal him or did you patch him up?
-ASHLY-
I took his body away, his body mark.
-AABRIA-
Right, I think that handles the-- he's no longer dealing with the deleterious effects of harm.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
But unless-- How badly do you want it to be gone? How important is it to you that he is unimpeded and unbandaged.
-ASHLY-
I think it would be important to her, yeah.
-AABRIA-
So maybe there's something in the way you bandaged it, and the way you've cleaned these wounds that almost feels like they sealed up again.
That's how precise you were.
Even though this was very ragged, ripped damage, everything just settles in a way, like it was more of a surgical cut than a series of scrapes.
You are not worried about why it worked, simply that it did.
Take a bleed.
-ASHLY-
(sharp inhale) Baby's got one more bleed in the pocket.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
God dang.
-ASHLY-
I don't know what the fuck's-- (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Your roll is normal.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Good luck! (laughs)
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
So if this is a rope, is this a Move or a finesse?
-SAM-
I probably have to go up there with the rope first and drop it down to you, I would assume, unless you're going to let us--
-AABRIA-
I mean, I'm happy to let you have a grappling hook.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-GINA-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
If you want a grappling hook.
-SAM-
Sure, I mean, we knew we were going to go break into a place, right?
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Yes. Then yes, it can be an interaction that would be Move or Control.
I'll let you decide what you use.
-SAM-
Doesn't matter to me, so I'll burn a drive and start climbing up.
Okay, six.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
Would've been fine!
-AABRIA-
You actually see, he makes it look easy.
That first initial scrabble belies how effective and really graceful he is.
He's lithe. He slips up.
It barely makes a sound as it catches at the top of the wall and he's making a little too much eye contact with you as he begins to climb.
(laughter)
You actually see that Oscar-- You understand that there's a muscle memory to certain behaviors, because you actually see as he climbs, he's tucking the rope under him at first to cover his tracks, and then he remembers that it's for you, too, and he releases it behind him.
-SAM-
Before I release it, I'll be like: Hey.
Do you want to take off that jacket before you come up here? (laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Not really, no.
-SAM-
All right, fine.
Just don't sparkle us so much that you get us caught.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
I'm going to add a drive, because the fuck I'm getting shown up by this-- (laughter)
-AABRIA-
I love this energy.
-SAM-
I'll also give him a drive.
-GINA-
Oh!
-SAM-
Because I'll pull.
-AABRIA-
Ooh!
-GINA-
Okay.
-NOSHIR-
Oh, good.
-AABRIA-
That's so good.
-NOSHIR-
Charity.
-SAM-
With one arm.
-ASHLY-
I think you guys might have the sexual tension.
-AABRIA-
One arm, and in that way that he's not hiding that he's doing it.
-GINA-
Why don't we explore this more?
-NOSHIR-
Oh man. Wow, okay.
I barely make it with a four.
-AABRIA-
Ooh!
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Mixed success.
You make your way up, and you can feel him assisting you.
You can feel the ways in which you are confined by your outfit, though your pride won't let you back down.
I'm going to say, I'm going to make you take a brain mark as your pride has been checked in a really foundational way for you.
-SAM-
I got you. Don't worry.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Take a scar.
-GINA-
Oh my god! (laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Thank you, Oscar.
What would I do without you?
-SAM-
We'll find out soon enough.
Let's look out for the guards.
You look right, I'll look left.
-AABRIA-
You look out and over, and looking in, you see that the guards are guarding the perimeter.
I think you can have that moment of being significantly more impressed with Silva's ability to escape, because again, it's that polished stone sheer face that he was able to work something out with a little bit of the trees against the wall, even though they're not touching, and a little bit of the ivy.
Whatever he did was unreal to get up and out.
But there's no one patrolling the inside.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
So you can drop down, it's just a bit of a drop.
-SAM-
The coast is clear.
Let's go.
-NOSHIR-
Sarkis made this climb unaided.
-SAM-
Yeah, he must be some sort of acrobat or something.
-NOSHIR-
Or he was let out.
-SAM-
Hmm.
Well, we'll figure that out later, I guess.
Come on, we've got to go.
-NOSHIR-
All right, I'm right behind you.
-SAM-
All right, I take off.
-AABRIA-
You use the rope and drop down?
-SAM-
Yes, please.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
No roll required.
You drop into the back and you have a clear view of the two areas of intrigue.
You know that you've got a football field's length to the door where people are moving around inside.
But the moon is out, but there's a little bit of cloud cover.
It's not so well lit that you would stick out like a sore thumb, and most importantly, you're not wearing the stark white clothing that would give you away in uninterrupted expanse.
As long as nothing disastrous happens, you can make your way to either one of those points unimpeded.
-SAM-
Go to the closer one first, I guess.
-NOSHIR-
I'd like to use Focus to analyze what might be the most strategic place to go.
Closest isn't necessarily the best.
-SAM-
(sneers) (grumbles mockingly)
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me that roll.
-NOSHIR-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
Why can't we just be friends?
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
Oh right, because I don't like you.
-AABRIA-
(gasps)
-AABRIA-
I'm sorry!
-NOSHIR-
Double fives on my gilded, so a success.
-SAM-
Nice.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-NOSHIR-
I would hope.
-AABRIA-
Mixed success, and you get a drive back if you spent it.
You look.
You have a little time.
You can breathe.
You can think.
You could split up, but splitting up is dangerous.
There's just enough distance that if something goes awry, you're not able to work together and these walls are strange.
Just as a note, do you leave the rope hanging down, or do you take it down with you?
-SAM-
If we want to get out fast, I would have left it hanging.
-NOSHIR-
The only thing I would consider is, there is no way your father is getting out with that rope unless we carry him ourselves.
-SAM-
Cosmo is going to be fine.
He's got the doc with him.
He's got the Madam with him.
(sighs)
-NOSHIR-
So we take the rope, and your father fends for himself.
-SAM-
We still need to get out, don't we?
-NOSHIR-
I suppose we do.
Lead on, Captain.
-SAM-
All right.
-AABRIA-
Closest one first.
You make your way across the grassy expanse to three stunted oaks and some low-lying shrubbery.
You don't have to get all the way to the brush line to see the ways in which that low-lying plant life has been recently dug up and ripped out.
You realize quite quickly, even through the shadows and the not nearly enough moonlight that you are looking towards something that is hiding the depth of it from you as you approach a hole.
-SAM-
A hole? Okay, how big? How deep?
-AABRIA-
You get right in there.
Five feet across, and you look down.
Without any external light source, you don't have a strong sense, but it is just dark brown dirt that leads endlessly down.
You don't know how deep it goes.
-SAM-
Didn't happen to bring a flashlight with you, did you?
-NOSHIR-
A what? I have a candle.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
What in the what?
-SAM-
Wow, even your gear's assholes.
(laughter)
Great, light the candle, then.
-NOSHIR-
What is fla-- Is that a prison move or something?
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
I don't understand.
Okay.
-SAM-
Yeah!
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
Under the level of the hole, so that the light hopefully stays shielded from our insistent patrols, I'll light the candle.
-AABRIA-
You light the candle using the trees, make sure that in as much as you can block yourself from vision at the back of the actual building.
You tilt the candle down, and once you get a little light in there, you have a sense of depth.
This goes down about 15 feet and terminates at this slate gray shale rock at this slate gray shale rock that seems to have crumbled inward.
-SAM-
We've got to go down.
-NOSHIR-
We don't even know if this leads into the sanatorium.
-SAM-
Wherever it leads, it's weird, right? Candela's all about finding weird shit.
-GINA-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
Oh god.
-SAM-
That guy was scared, the Johnny guy, the patient guy.
He ran this way, maybe it was to get away to a secret spot he knew.
-NOSHIR-
This is the place on the map that's marked with the X? This is where Johnny disappeared?
-AABRIA-
This is the--
-SAM-
Direction that he ran.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, this is the trajectory.
With your memory of bloody hands and being coated in dirt? Yeah.
-SAM-
Why? What do you know about them? I saw your face when you were talking to that guy.
You went all blank.
What do you know that you're not telling us?
-NOSHIR-
Not enough, apparently.
Prepare yourself.
-SAM-
For what?
-NOSHIR-
Horrors.
After you.
-SAM-
(heavy exhale) All right, let's go.
-AABRIA-
In that moment, as you steel yourself to go below, we'll cut back to the office.
You find yourself in a massive office.
It stretches out.
There's just not enough furniture for this place.
You see what is too much of a big mahogany desk, probably eight feet long, beautifully carved, covered with all of the tchotchkes and little decanters and pen holders, and it still feels small and a little simple to you.
You grew up in finery and you understand how all of that should look and feel, what rooms that exude grandeur should evoke.
This feels, to you, a sort of bad attempt, a mockery of opulence.
-ASHLY-
Mm.
-AABRIA-
You're standing on a nice rug, but again, too small for this room.
The back wall is a bank of glass windows looking out onto the premises, the lawns, and you have an unimpeded view as the curtains are open.
There's a little bit of moonlight.
You see to the left, all the way flush against the wall, again, a too small set of cabinets and files.
On the far right wall, a little washbasin, but no other sitting arrangement.
Just her desk, her chair, her rug, and the tools of her business.
What do you look for?
-ASHLY-
I'd like to look for-- I think it would be potentially personal correspondence, because the nun I don't think is necessarily directly involved with the sanatorium.
-AABRIA-
Definitely not.
-ASHLY-
So there must be something.
It wouldn't be in medical files or anything, any information we're looking for, so I'm guessing I would go to the desk and try to see if there's anything that looks like it doesn't belong there, like it isn't about the business that she would be conducting.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Give me a Survey roll.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
Do I want to use drive?
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
That was adorable.
-ASHLY-
I got a mixed success.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
You begin searching frantically, and you have that sense of, I don't know how long I have, but I have to find it.
They figured out a way to make it, but I'm on my own, and if I squander this opportunity, it's wasted, and who knows what will happen to them? You don't know how they're doing.
Yeah.
(sighs)
-ASHLY-
Do I do this?
-AABRIA-
The question is, how stressed out is Elsie in this moment as she searches? You will, at the end of whatever this is, find the information you're looking for, but how calm and how confident are you as you search through, and it takes just a little bit too long? You're opening more drawers than you thought you would have to.
-ASHLY-
Not calm.
I think this is not-- Most of the assignments that she's been on with Cosmo have probably been less intense than this.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
She's already had to lie and act in front of a bunch of people.
That's not something she does.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
She knows that time is of the essence.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLY-
In general, the day has been kind of a bear, so I think she is not composed at all.
-AABRIA-
Okay. Token.
How many are you at?
-ASHLY-
Five.
-AABRIA-
Good to know.
-ASHLY-
I have one left.
-AABRIA-
One left.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-AABRIA-
(sighs) You eventually find it.
You see it there.
Letters, correspondence, folded in a way that official business simply isn't on heavier letter stock that isn't used in the day to day where you would spend time and money and care in woven paper and nice ink and maybe even a light smell to it.
I will say, your mixed success was not the panic.
That was coming no matter what.
The mixed success is that you notice, as you're moving, as you're searching around the desk looking for a hidden compartment, because you're not getting what you want, you see a little flicker of light off in the distance in the backyard, and your eye flicks up to that central little area of trees.
You're not sure what's happening, but you do see movement there, and the very specific yellow glow of a small bit of fire light or a candle.
-ASHLY-
Do I know-- Am I geographically savvy enough to know that that's where they would be headed?
-AABRIA-
You have that sense of, oh, this opens out onto the back area, and looking at the map, you're like, great, I knew that there was a thing in the middle, one off on a side, and then the back wall.
So yeah, you can put two and two together and say that that's either them or something different and worse is happening.
-ASHLY-
Okay, I'm going to, if I can, because there's a window, right?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to glance and see, have guards noticed this? Is this something-- Am I the only one seeing this or has there been--
-AABRIA-
There's no one else out in that lawn.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
(laughs) I know Raj keeps candles on him.
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
That's so quirky, it's got to be true.
-ASHLY-
Uh-huh.
-AABRIA-
I accept it, yeah.
-ASHLY-
Okay, well, if there aren't--
-AABRIA-
Little candle man.
-NOSHIR-
We were experimenting, what was I supposed to do?
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Candle wax.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
Temperature play.
-ASHLY-
So if I don't see any guards that could notice them, I don't necessarily think that I would panic about that.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
I would clock that--
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLY-
-- they've maybe found something.
-AABRIA-
Clocked, and it's just enough of a distraction that your mind moves to them and, oh, how are they doing?
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
How am I doing? We're all doing our jobs right now and we're under the clock.
-ASHLY-
Uh-huh. Okay.
-AABRIA-
Then you find the correspondence.
You open it up and see it, and you don't recognize the words.
It's not the alphabet that you've ever interacted with.
It's just strange symbols patterned with breaks and all of the spacing of a letter written in Fairen, and yet, even in your time in Candela, I don't know if you've come across ancient Fairen, but you know you're not looking at your language.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Something's different.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to pocket it and then try to put things back--
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ASHLY-
-- where they were and then (clicks tongue) skedaddle.
-AABRIA-
You restore order and slip out, hoping that you didn't waste too much time.
To my friends in the front, the fainter and the freak out, how are you doing? You have two orderlies around you, one's holding you heroically, and the other's just slapping your face.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Like, "Come on.
Up, up, up."
-GINA-
Get your filthy hands off of me.
(scoffs) I'm up.
-AABRIA-
"It's not filthy.
I have to be clean.
I work in a hospital."
-GINA-
I peek over at Cosmo to see how he's doing.
-LIAM-
Cosmo, at a lower level, is still babbling, but at a lower frequency.
I don't know, none of you are real.
This isn't real. Who are-- But I've got one eye creeping up to the hallway waiting for Elsie to appear.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
(babbling incoherently) But I want-- Yeah, she's lying to me, they're lying to me.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
I'm old. Eyes!
-AABRIA-
I'm not even going to make you roll because you've so fully committed to I'm a distraction and I will spin up and down and in sync with that and the moment you see just that little bit of extra moonlight, before you see her, before you see her shadow on the ground, you see the change in light there.
Yep.
-LIAM-
Where am I?
-AABRIA-
Spin up again.
-LIAM-
Where an I?
-GINA-
I keep an eye on him and I mirror him.
The more he freaks out, the more--
-LIAM-
What is this place? Where am I?
-GINA-
Oh! I don't feel that good!
-AABRIA-
"What's happening?"
-GINA-
Oh, it's so warm in here!
-ASHLY-
I'm going to come back out and--
-AABRIA-
"Where did the doctor go?"
-ASHLY-
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
-AABRIA-
"Did you pull it together?"
-LIAM-
I don't want this, I want my room.
I want my room!
-AABRIA-
"Sure, sure."
-LIAM-
I don't want this, I want my room!
-AABRIA-
"You know what?"
-GINA-
I'm missing eyebrows.
-AABRIA-
"We can have them committed--"
-LIAM-
Take me home to my room!
-AABRIA-
"-- now and have you pull--"
-ASHLY-
Look, I'm so sorry, I--
-LIAM-
I want my <i>room</i>!
-ASHLY-
I understand.
This is very unprofessional of me.
-AABRIA-
"Deeply. What's your name again?"
-ASHLY-
I'm so sorry.
-AABRIA-
"Do you have a license?"
-ASHLY-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
"Prove to me, just give me some kind of documentation."
-LIAM-
Take me home, I want my room.
-AABRIA-
"Because you're not giving me a lot of confidence in your medical abilities."
-LIAM-
I want my room.
-ASHLY-
I mean, I would have.
-GINA-
We will have a room soon.
-ASHLY-
Yeah, you're reading perfectly as a doctor.
She's just unloading on you.
Look, I'm so sorry.
I will take him back to his-- I can handle this.
-LIAM-
No!
-ASHLY-
I'll take him home.
-LIAM-
My room!
-ASHLY-
I know, I will take you home.
-LIAM-
My room!
-ASHLY-
I will take you home.
-AABRIA-
"You have 30 seconds to leave my facility--"
-ASHLY-
Yes, ma'am.
-AABRIA-
"-- or all of you will be put under evaluation."
-ASHLY-
Okay, yes, ma'am, we are leaving.
We are leaving.
-LIAM-
All of you can go to hell!
-ASHLY-
We're leaving and I take him and I start wheel him out.
-GINA-
We'll help him get home.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You feel as you are moving around to go grab the handles of his wheelchair, you see she puts a gentle hand.
It doesn't look flexed or hard on your shoulder, and with one violent jerk, actually scoots your chair so you are pointed out the door in a show of incredible strength with no effort.
-LIAM-
Take it, take it away.
-AABRIA-
"Have a good night."
-LIAM-
Take it away.
-ASHLY-
I'm so sorry.
-AABRIA-
"Make better choices."
-ASHLY-
I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry.
And then I keep going out.
-LIAM-
I'm surrounded by a circus of lies.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
As as we're leaving, he's, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ASHLY-
That's what we're doing.
-LIAM-
As we're leaving the door, because I don't want this just to shut off: What are you giving me? I don't want that.
I don't want that! Ow, ah! No! Ow, ow.
Oh.
Oh.
Into a faux medicated taper off.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
(weak groan)
-AABRIA-
Do you pause? Yeah.
-ASHLY-
We're going.
We're moseying back to where--
-LIAM-
Towards the exit.
I want to be quiet by the time we get there.
-AABRIA-
Perfect, yep.
You see the orderlies flanked by the director and now some of the guards that were farther down in the hall, and even maybe a patient or two, peeking through the glass doors at the far end of the hallway.
Everyone's just watching the commotion.
So, on top of all of that, you have pulled any focus the guards inside the building might have had on the back.
-ASHLY-
Sweet.
-LIAM-
I am now just limp body.
(groans)
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
(laughs) You make your way out back to the quiet evening.
Do you go down my little hole?
-SAM-
Of course.
(laughter)
Do you?
-NOSHIR-
Well, I want to ask.
-AABRIA-
Yeah?
-NOSHIR-
How does bleed detection work? Like what can be told from detecting bleed?
-AABRIA-
So the idea of this would be if you're trying to pick up a trail or detect bleed in thresholds or amounts that you wouldn't notice right away because anyone in proximity to incredible amounts of bleed is going to feel it regardless, but this allows you a little more sense of focus, directionality, intensity, and the ability to hone in.
-NOSHIR-
Does it give any indication of say recency?
-AABRIA-
Recency?
-NOSHIR-
Like if a bleed taint has been in the area recently, would that be something that you could tell with a bleed detector or not?
-AABRIA-
So the fun thing about this is you get to tell me what your bleed detector is like and what it's capable of, and if it was important to you to have that information, like the fact that your mind went to that might indicate that it would be something that you would, like a functionality you would want to have on you, so, yes.
-NOSHIR-
You don't have to like me, but do you trust me in this moment?
-SAM-
No.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-GINA-
Saw that coming.
-NOSHIR-
Do you trust Elsie, then?
-SAM-
Of course.
-NOSHIR-
Then for her sake, you keep a lookout.
I'm going to see if I can tell--
-SAM-
Me keep a lookout?
-NOSHIR-
-- if this creature's been down there, yes.
-SAM-
You're going to scurry down?
-NOSHIR-
I'm not going down there.
I just need to check on bleed real quick.
Can you do that for me? My attention will be focused here.
-SAM-
I can do that for her.
-NOSHIR-
On that, we can agree.
Thank you.
I pull a monocle out of my jacket pocket.
-AABRIA-
Oh!
-NOSHIR-
And peer down into the space.
While I do that, my other hand, de-gloved, goes to my jacket and clutches a claw.
As I watch in the space, centipedes and maggots and small insects start to come out of the soil and I'm watching to see the direction that they travel and how dense they arrive.
If it's scant, there won't be a lot of response, but if it's a high presence or recent activity, I'll see it in how agitated they are.
-AABRIA-
You watch this strange set of circumstances.
I think in your little bit of interaction with Candela, all of this is very technical and very clinical, stupid little gadgets made of brass that spin and squeal.
This feels close to the thing that you're looking for.
Monocle up, his hand in his pocket, and then as if a fresh rain has sent all of the bugs in this freshly turned earth upward, you see earthworms and centipedes rising up, writhing, wriggling, and then flinging themselves into the hole.
You can feel it.
She's there.
So close.
Your chest--
-NOSHIR-
We have to wait.
-SAM-
Wait? Wait for what?
-NOSHIR-
We have to wait for the others.
-SAM-
I don't even know if they're coming here.
-NOSHIR-
The two of us alone can't handle whatever she is and she is down there.
-SAM-
I'll wait if you tell me what she did to you.
-NOSHIR-
We don't have time for this.
-SAM-
We do if we wait.
What did she do to you?
-NOSHIR-
What she did to me is of no consequence.
-SAM-
Then I'm going down.
-NOSHIR-
She destroyed my sister.
Broke her into something I couldn't recognize.
Shattered her mind and broke her will, and then tore her into a thousand pieces in front of me.
Is that enough for you? What more details do you need?
-SAM-
How old were you?
-NOSHIR-
Not old enough.
-SAM-
I'm sorry.
-NOSHIR-
It was a long time ago.
-SAM-
(sighs)
-AABRIA-
Oscar, what are you going to do?
-SAM-
I scan around to see if any guards are afoot, anyone picking up our--
-AABRIA-
You see the guards that you saw milling about have now backed away and are gone.
-SAM-
That's weird.
(sighs) If I look towards the front door, do I see any of our people?
-ASHLY-
We would've presumably made some sort of plan about meeting up again or something.
-SAM-
Oh, you would think.
-ASHLY-
You would think.
-AABRIA-
That's really fun.
I didn't hear it.
-ASHLY-
Yeah, fair enough.
-SAM-
I didn't either.
-ASHLY-
Fair enough.
-SAM-
Fine, I'll go get them.
Wait here. I'll go get them. I'll be right back.
-NOSHIR-
You would--? Fine.
-SAM-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
What do you do?
-SAM-
I'll close up my coat and scurry across around the back towards the front, see if I can find our friends.
-AABRIA-
You get back up and over the wall.
-SAM-
Over the wall? We're inside the wall, right?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're inside the wall.
Where are you headed?
-SAM-
I'm going to the, I assume there's a--
-AABRIA-
This is basically a backyard with a single door that leads into the building.
-SAM-
Oh, it's not an open thing.
-AABRIA-
No, it doesn't go all the way around.
-SAM-
Oh, I--
-AABRIA-
You are stuck in the backyard of this place.
-LIAM-
I did not understand that.
-ASHLY-
I didn't either.
-SAM-
I didn't understand that either.
-AABRIA-
I didn't explain it well and that's on me.
-SAM-
It's not like a campus that we're inside the walls of now.
-AABRIA-
No.
-LIAM-
How the hell am I going to get there?
-SAM-
How are they going to get here? Well, if they're going to go-- if I knew that, then I would, I'll go around, up the wall all the way around the front to fetch them, I guess.
-AABRIA-
You know what? No.
I'll walk it back, it's okay.
You have a backyard.
You see that the main building is such that that's the one door you can go to.
There is that little bit of an edge between the main wall that's maybe a person's length and a little overgrown, that it would funnel you towards that set of doors, but the wall and the building are not flush together on the side, there's a little bit of clearance.
-SAM-
There's a dog run?
-AABRIA-
There's a dog-- (laughs) Yes.
There's a little dog run on the side that could get you to the front.
-SAM-
Okay, I'll peer down the little side run and if it's clear, I will shimmy through.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're able to make your way and pick your way through, and you can hear them before you can see them because there's still a little bit of getting around a corner and potentially interacting with any of the guard cycles and rotations, but you can hear distinct set of footsteps, boots, heels, wheels.
-SAM-
I can hear them.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you hear them coming out the front of the building.
-SAM-
Once they're clear, I will give a, if I see them, I'll give a: Psst, psst.
-ASHLY-
Oh, so we hear that?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-GINA-
We hear that?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-SAM-
Hey, over here.
-LIAM-
(weak groan)
-SAM-
Oh god, what did you do to him?
-ASHLY-
He's fine. He's acting.
He's being a little bit too method.
-GINA-
I think we're clear now.
-LIAM-
How'd you know my father was in the circus?
-GINA-
(laughs)
-ASHLY-
All right, so we're going to wheel him over.
-AABRIA-
So yeah, you have that sense of like, oh, okay.
Not seeing it from the front.
We'll give it up to a trick of the light and the imposing architecture that there is that little bit of gap there that is a little overgrown because it's not well-manicured, but there is clearance to get to the side and then the dog run and then back to the yard.
-SAM-
Is there clearance for a wheelchair or do we have to pick him up?
-AABRIA-
No, we can get a wheelchair back there.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I could Yoda it if I need to? (laughter)
-SAM-
You mean do flips and lightsabers?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-GINA-
Oscar, where's Rajan?
-SAM-
Oh yeah, he's in a dark, scary hole that's full of--
-GINA-
What? Ooh!
-ASHLY-
What do you mean a dark scary hole?
-GINA-
You left him there?
-SAM-
I don't know, there was all sorts of worms and bugs and stuff and--
-AABRIA-
Take it.
Token.
-ASHLY-
Fuck! Because I would know, wouldn't I?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-ASHLY-
Fuck.
So I roll six dice?
-AABRIA-
So let's talk about what's going to happen now as you explain and you watch as the good doctor begins to spin up.
It's quietly at first but you are aware of her breath, feeling it before you hear it.
She's not panting, but it's steady and it's loud.
You are going to roll 6d6 and I need you to tell me how many ones you get, if any.
-GINA-
Ooh, Elsie.
-LIAM-
Elsie, dear.
-SAM-
Doc?
-GINA-
You don't look too well.
-ASHLY-
What did he say about it?
-SAM-
He just said that there was lots. I'm sure it's fine.
Calm down.
-ASHLY-
He wouldn't have stayed there if it wasn't-- I got one.
-AABRIA-
One one?
-LIAM-
One one.
-AABRIA-
That's all it takes. Elsie.
You are asking, you are trying to make sense.
Maybe if you know a little more, if you know what was said, if you know what you saw, you could figure it out and you could spin yourself down.
Then you feel it, almost like a pulse.
Almost like a release that begins not in your heart but your lungs as your breath takes over and you are lost to it and you begin to transform.
-ASHLY-
Can I croak out a "Run!" before I start to transform?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ASHLY-
Okay.
Y'all know what that means.
-SAM-
I do.
-AABRIA-
I don't know. Cosmo.
-ASHLY-
Oscar.
-AABRIA-
Has Cosmo ever seen it?
-LIAM-
No.
-ASHLY-
Just Oscar.
-SAM-
I know.
-AABRIA-
Then what's about to happen will be quite a shock.
-SAM-
Run.
-AABRIA-
Would you like to describe what happens as Dr. Elsie Roberts loses herself to her beast?
-ASHLY-
I would love to.
-AABRIA-
Yeah?
-ASHLY-
So I scream "run" and then I manage maybe to croak out a "Raj, run!" as the veins in my neck pop out and the clothing on my body begins to shred as muscles that don't belong to a human start to gorge out of every part of my body.
My face, the skin on my face tears and in its place becomes a bastardized version of an orca and a mantis.
As the muscles protrude with sickening crunches as my bones elongate in ways they're not supposed to, I get onto all fours.
I become impossibly large, so large that I'm towering over them, and there's no vestige of who I was in my eyes anymore.
I am a creature and I am gasping for air.
As I gasp for air, a fog flood begins rolling over the surrounding grounds.
It's covering everything.
You can't see an inch in front of your face.
As I pant and wheeze and pant and wheeze and then scream and rush into the sanatorium.
-SAM-
Into?
-GINA-
Into?! Oh, we're just going in.
-AABRIA-
Oh!
-LIAM-
Oh, Elsie, I'm so sorry, child.
(wheelchair bumping) (laughter)
-SAM-
As that's happening, I instinctually put my body between hers and Cosmo's.
Before she runs off, since I know this is happening--
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
-- I'm going to try to prevent her from doing that, if that's all right.
-AABRIA-
Ooh.
I would love it.
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
There's a moment we can have here if we all agree at the table.
You have one "one" that you need to resolve.
-ASHLY-
Uh-huh.
-AABRIA-
Your beast must destroy something in order to resolve itself, in order to move through it.
There is something offering itself to you.
It would be so easy.
He's right there in front of you.
-ASHLY-
No.
-AABRIA-
Defenseless.
Do you think your beast would turn away such easy meat?
-ASHLY-
Could I make a roll to see if there's any Elsie in there that knows who's in front of her?
-AABRIA-
I love dice games and I love story.
-ASHLY-
You want me to just choose? (laughs)
-AABRIA-
But this is not a roll of the dice.
Your beast is not reasoned with and Elsie is not home.
Whatever you choose, we will respect and honor as a table.
I simply ask that you choose, and know that we all know what kind of story this is.
-ASHLY-
Okay. Okay.
-AABRIA-
No wrong choices.
What does the beast do?
-ASHLY-
(sighs) The beast would take Oscar by the neck--
-SAM-
Bring it.
-ASHLY-
-- and slam him against the nearest wall and start choking, but with the force of a gorilla, basically.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You do the thing that you always hoped to do, which was protect.
You agreed to be here in order to look out for the old man.
There is a perverse satisfaction to getting your wish.
There's no fighting it.
She's too strong.
You knew what was coming.
You knew what would happen.
So I guess there's not a lot of fear or noise or fight as you feel the tender flesh of your neck give way.
First your larynx, then the bone, and the nothing.
-SAM-
As my throat is crushed, I will try to eke out a very calm: It's okay, it's okay, I'll be fine.
-AABRIA-
And then he's dead.
[heavy breathing]
You feel yourself sated.
You return to the surface and maybe the fastest it's ever happened.
You come back, but we're not worried about Elsie right now.
Oscar, we're here again.
It's just you and me in the dark.
-ASHLY-
What?
-AABRIA-
How many times has this happened to you? [heavy breathing]
-SAM-
This'll be seven.
-GINA-
What the fuck?
-AABRIA-
Again and again and again.
Maybe this time you hope it would be different, but it feels just like every other time.
Oblivion and weightlessness.
But you're still there.
There's nowhere for you to go but back.
I'm going to ask you, you can feel it in this space.
I think some part of you knows that you won't keep the understanding of this back there.
But you have to pay a price every time.
You don't get to choose it.
You will return again.
You can't stay down.
What do you give to whatever this is that pulls you back? What do you lose forever?
-SAM-
(exhales sharply) [heavy breathing]
A memory, a skill, a friend, an image.
I've lost them all every time I'm killed.
-AABRIA-
Every time.
-SAM-
I don't remember my other kid.
I've forgotten most of my wife.
[heavy breathing]
I lost some of my charisma, my performance ability.
I don't really have anything else to lose.
-AABRIA-
That's not true.
-SAM-
I have only Cosmo.
-ASHLY-
(gasps)
-SAM-
I only have my son.
And so if I take a breath in, I know it will cleanse my mind of our days together.
[heavy breathing]
-AABRIA-
You feel something in that space.
There's always a pushback.
There's always something that you're fighting against, even at the edge of the void.
There's someone with you, something with you.
It doesn't stay your hand or claim all of your breath, but just a little gasp of surprise or panic.
Just some, not all.
He's everything.
Even that cost is too dear.
So a portion.
What do you lose of him?
-SAM-
I guess I'll lose everything from before.
I guess I'll lose everything from before.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
From when he was just a kid.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. That's enough.
Part of you.
Loving and doting and precious because every moment means so much because he'll grow up and someday you'll be gone.
All you can do is hope that your time together will allow him the strength and the wisdom and the grace to move through the world well.
A worthy cost.
And you have no other choice. It's gone.
You feel something important leave you.
It's not a voice, but you know there's a voice as something pours itself into the gap that your young son has left in you, and it tastes like old magick and melted gold.
"You're so close.
Any more, and I don't know if you'll be there, too, but I need you to come to me."
-SAM-
Who's saying that?
-AABRIA-
You have no idea.
The more you pour your thought and energy into what this is and where you are, you are rocketed back to the world, to life.
You will never remember the conversation, the seventh conversation that you've had here in the dark.
You all are standing over the corpse of Oscar Grimm.
What do you do?
-GINA-
I am holding onto him.
Oscar? Oscar, please no! I look over at Elsie.
What in the hells was that?!
-LIAM-
Elsie, dear?
-GINA-
Oscar?
-LIAM-
Elsie, it's all right.
-ASHLY-
Cosmo?
-LIAM-
It will be all right.
I'm so sorry, child.
-ASHLY-
I'm so sorry, Cosmo.
(breaths shakily)
-LIAM-
No, no.
No, no.
-GINA-
Oscar, wake up. Oscar?
-LIAM-
I brought you here.
I practically begged you.
It's all right, child.
It's all right.
It's all right.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and take two brain for me of the trauma of killing one of your closest relationships.
Now I will say, Raj, you heard the scream.
You see strange fog from that side in the corner.
Do you wait? Do you move?
-NOSHIR-
No.
-AABRIA-
What do you do?
-NOSHIR-
I heard Elsie cry.
-AABRIA-
You did.
-NOSHIR-
I go there as fast as I can.
-AABRIA-
So you have definitely rejoined them as the fog begins to dissipate.
No sign of the beast she became.
Just the person you once loved shaking and sobbing and standing over a corpse.
-GINA-
She killed him! Whatever she was.
-NOSHIR-
What?
-GINA-
She's this beast! She's not human! She killed Oscar.
Look at him.
-NOSHIR-
What are you talking about?
-GINA-
His throat's been ripped out because of her! Whatever the hell that was!
-LIAM-
Everybody just take a breath.
Take a breath.
Elsie is like a daughter to me.
-GINA-
What?
-LIAM-
It's going to be all right.
We have to keep our heads in this moment.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to take one of Oscar's hands and gently turn it to where I had bandaged it.
-AABRIA-
You just hold and weep.
Try to pull yourself together.
Keep it quiet.
You are still hidden.
You are still a part of a mission.
(thuds) (thuds)
-LIAM-
I take Glask by the hand.
-AABRIA-
(thuds)
-GINA-
Cosmo, what are you doing? What if she hurts us?
-AABRIA-
(loud thud)
-ASHLY-
I can't be here.
-GINA-
Cosmo.
-LIAM-
She's not going to.
-AABRIA-
(loud thud)
-GINA-
Look what she did!
-ASHLY-
I can't be here.
-GINA-
Cosmo, how can you trust her?
-LIAM-
As long as you've known me, you have to trust me.
-ASHLY-
Cosmo, I can't be here.
-AABRIA-
(loud thud)
-NOSHIR-
I'm going to hold her.
-AABRIA-
You feel it before you see it.
The shift in the corpse as broken vertebrae snap into place.
The distorted figure of his neck coming back into alignment.
-GINA-
Oscar?
-AABRIA-
The rush of blood that brings color back to his cheeks and then gently, peacefully, Oscar Grimm opens his eyes.
-GINA-
What?
-ASHLY-
Oscar?
-GINA-
What? Impossible.
-SAM-
I mean, most people call me Cary.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-GINA-
I hate him so much.
-LIAM-
I want-- Like sometimes you just--
-- everyone to keep their heads.
-ASHLY-
I killed you myself.
I killed you.
I snapped your neck, I felt your neck snap, how are you--
-LIAM-
Elsie, Elsie, Elsie.
-ASHLY-
How are you alive?
-SAM-
I don't know, but that was loud and we have to move.
-LIAM-
Are you all right? Look at me.
Are you all right?
-SAM-
I go over to Cosmo and I wrap my arms around him and I give him a giant hug and just say: I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
-LIAM-
For what?
-SAM-
I'm a burden on you.
-LIAM-
What, boy?
-SAM-
I'm a burden on you.
-LIAM-
No.
No.
This wasn't your choice, boy.
It wasn't your choice.
-SAM-
I should be taking care of you, not the other way around.
-LIAM-
We don't choose what our family is.
-SAM-
(heavy sigh)
-LIAM-
It simply is.
-SAM-
I'm sorry, Doc.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to all of you, but we can't stay here.
There's guards, there's-- We have to move.
We have to finish.
We have to get out of here.
-GINA-
Surely, we can't take her with us! Look what she just did.
-SAM-
She's one of us.
-AABRIA-
You know now-- I'm just going to jump in, Glask.
You know that with your raised tone, you can hear your voice carry.
It wraps through that little dog run area.
You can feel it echoing.
-ASHLY-
She's right, Cosmo.
-AABRIA-
You see the low-lying fog on the ground.
-LIAM-
We will have to continue this somewhere else, not on these grounds.
-ASHLY-
She's right, I'm not safe.
-SAM-
You're fine.
You're one of us.
-ASHLY-
I killed you.
-SAM-
Nobody's perfect.
We just got to look out for you like you look after me.
Like I look after him and he looks after me.
-LIAM-
So where do we go?
-AABRIA-
You have two options.
You know that the hole is important, but is that the priority? Do you prioritize the mission, or taking your shattered, broken circle or taking your shattered, broken circle to safety and cutting your losses?
-SAM-
That's not my choice.
It's the guy who lost his sister's choice.
-NOSHIR-
Lost my sister? You just lost yourself.
-LIAM-
Come. I'm moving--
-NOSHIR-
I don't understand.
-LIAM-
-- out onto the grounds away from this location.
Come.
-SAM-
Follow him.
-NOSHIR-
Elsie, he's fine.
I don't know what transpired here, but he's okay.
-ASHLY-
You don't know.
You don't know.
-NOSHIR-
I don't know, and I'm not going to pretend that I do, but Oscar is okay.
We're going to be okay.
-ASHLY-
I wish that were true, Raj.
I'm going to-- I think I'm going to start booking it in another direction.
-AABRIA-
You're in the center of this little catch, so you really only have two directions.
You're caught in that little nook where either you come back from whence you came and exit the grounds and leave and go somewhere else in the city, or you go back in the direction that Raj and Oscar came from to the back towards the hole.
-LIAM-
The doctor is a phenomenon, yes?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Yes.
As she begins to leave, I'm going to use my occultist ability, Speak Their Language, and I start to speak simple words in Oldfairen that reverberate in a barely noticeable, unnatural way.
that reverberate in a barely noticeable, unnatural way.
In the base of your skull, you understand me to be saying: Come back.
You are not alone.
Come.
-ASHLY-
Slowly, I'm going to, very much against my will, turn back around and look at Cosmo.
Then let's go now.
-NOSHIR-
We have to leave.
-SAM-
I'm going to the hole.
-NOSHIR-
No.
-SAM-
We're going to the hole.
-NOSHIR-
No.
-SAM-
We didn't come all this way, I didn't die for nothing.
-NOSHIR-
I'm not losing more people I love because we're not ready.
Do you understand? We're not even close to full strength.
As it is, there's no chance.
-SAM-
What are you talking about? We're fine.
-NOSHIR-
We're fine? She's broken in spirit.
I don't even know what's happened to you.
-LIAM-
Doctor, I think Elsie's strength speaks for itself.
-ASHLY-
Let's finish what we started.
-AABRIA-
In this moment, what is Madam Glask thinking?
-GINA-
She does not trust Elsie at all.
She's torn between what she just saw and one of her oldest friends, Cosmo, reassuring her that everything is fine and she wants to believe him so bad.
He's never led her astray.
-AABRIA-
I need you to take a brain.
-GINA-
Mm.
-AABRIA-
This is beyond the pale.
-GINA-
This is inhuman, it's not real.
-AABRIA-
You didn't sign up for this.
You thought the monsters would be the things you fought, not the things you fought alongside.
-GINA-
You have been in my home with my girls and you didn't say anything! Cosmo, and you knew about this!
-ASHLY-
I'm sorry.
-GINA-
Sorry? How do I know you're not going to do this again?
-NOSHIR-
Cordelia, it is not the time.
-GINA-
How do I know if I'm safe?
-SAM-
Keep your voices down.
-GINA-
How do I know if I'm safe?
-ASHLY-
You're not.
-NOSHIR-
None of us are safe.
-LIAM-
I will take responsibility for this.
-GINA-
Cosmo.
-LIAM-
Dr. Roberts is not a danger in the city from day to day with your girls or with you.
I take it on myself.
I dragged her here.
-GINA-
Cosmo, if anything happened to you, Cosmo.
-LIAM-
I have lived enough for three lifetimes.
I'm not worried about me.
-AABRIA-
In this moment, I think as the pivot point, the lack of trust, the lack of commitment to the cause, commitment to this, you don't have skin in this game the way the others seem to.
I want you to make the choice.
Which way do you walk? Back into the grounds towards the hole, or do you leave?
-GINA-
I walk back in, I trust-- Cosmo, you've-- You're the longest friend I've had.
If anything, I will be there to make sure you're safe.
-LIAM-
Dear, I-- I don't want you to do anything you don't have a stomach for, but this is why Candela shines in the dark for so many centuries.
If not for us, what will keep the dark at bay? Yes, we had to dabble in it ourselves to understand and cope.
-GINA-
Madam Glask takes a last look at Elsie.
So we finish what we've started, then.
-SAM-
Lead on by the light of the candle.
-ASHLY-
It's what you came here for, Raj.
-NOSHIR-
Is it? All right, professor.
Let's see it done.
-AABRIA-
So you are resolved to finish what you began, to see this assignment through, to climb down a hole that goes down to Mother knows where, and you time your passage across that lawn to the settling of the interior of the sanitorium.
You make quick work using some clever use of rope.
Everyone makes it down, yourself included, past the dirt, down the slope, past that broken-in stone that you realize is the collapsed ceiling of some unadorned, is the collapsed ceiling of some unadorned, unimportant hallway in an Oldfairen building.
Now, in a city like this that's so obviously and celebrated for being built on top of the ruins of what came before, this would be unremarkable, but hmm, I need Cosmo.
but hmm, I need Cosmo.
-LIAM-
Yes?
-AABRIA-
Can you make a Focus roll for me?
-LIAM-
Of course, hmm.
So that's one of mine, yes.
I will go just a straight roll as it is.
-NOSHIR-
With my archeological experience, is this something that I can support?
-AABRIA-
Absolutely.
-NOSHIR-
I'll give you a Drive.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-NOSHIR-
Oh, you've already rolled.
-LIAM-
Save that shit! (laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Never mind.
-LIAM-
Because I got a six on the gilded.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful!
-ASHLY-
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
A full success.
As your circle deals with how to lower you As your circle deals with how to lower you and your chair down, you begin to think, you spread out where you are and the mental map that you have of Oldfaire beneath.
Though there are places due east of here between the Sidle and the Stentorian River, between the Sidle and the Stentorian River, so many sites in Oldfaire sit underneath Groundswell and Hallowharbor and the Eaves and South Soffit.
But to your recollection, you do not know of any Oldfairen sites that sit underneath the Sidle, and yet-- [astrolabe scraping]
You are all down there.
You hear it, you see it.
You are in an unadorned tunnel, some attic caved in, in a bureaucratic building, hallways extending in every direction.
And down littered by your feet, along with 2,000 years of uninterrupted dust and detritus, you see the corpses of five other patients, their hands destroyed, broken down to nubs, missing fingers their hands destroyed, broken down to nubs, missing fingers beaten away as they spent their lives clawing, excavating, beaten away as they spent their lives clawing, excavating, getting down, following orders from the nun, the Maw.
getting down, following orders from the nun, the Maw.
They lie here, spent and forgotten.
You all see a mess of footprints headed off to the left down a series of dark halls.
You make your way carefully, as quietly as you can, until you hear it a little clearer, thumping, scratching, knocking, the sounds of further excavation down and away, knocking, the sounds of further excavation down and away, and low voices.
You make your way, and then you feel it, you know it.
You are just around the corner from whatever this is, whoever's down here, whatever's going on.
It's so loud.
The beating, the scratching, the clawing, not with tools, but again that wet flesh being flung against stone and wood but again that wet flesh being flung against stone and wood and ancient history.
They don't hear you.
They didn't hear you coming.
So you have a moment now before whatever happens happens.
What do you want to do?
-ASHLY-
Raj?
-NOSHIR-
This circle is not broken, but it is most certainly bent.
My sister, Aadtika, suffered a fate very similar to these chained servitors, and I need you to know the little bit that I found.
Oldfaire specialized in ferocious weaponry.
Oldfaire specialized in ferocious weaponry.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-NOSHIR-
One of their weapons that they found a way to control was famine.
that they found a way to control was famine.
Using dark forces, they turned locusts into flesh-eating, venomous spirits en mass.
In the other lands, the remains of those barren fields were walked by children whose parents had been annihilated.
The Great Maw comes from the despair of starving children.
The Great Maw comes from the despair of starving children.
To that end, if we go in there with doubt, or the crumbling of hope, we will never succeed.
I don't have to like you to trust you.
I promise you here and now, I will give my everything to keep you safe.
-LIAM-
It is not an easy burden that Candela bears.
We've carried it for centuries and more.
I wouldn't have begrudged any of you for leaving, but I am grateful to have you here.
If things go south, Rajan, all of you, it will be harder for me to go up than it was to go down.
Don't let that trouble you, do your duty.
-SAM-
It's not going to come to that.
We're not going to leave you.
-NOSHIR-
I agree.
-ASHLY-
Raj.
What's on the other side of that door?
-NOSHIR-
If she is here, I don't know the form she takes today.
She was beautiful and then she was toothed horror, like nothing I've ever seen, more insect than person.
She will try to lever your greatest fears and your deepest mistrusts.
-LIAM-
I reach into the satchel I always have at my side and pull out a jawbone.
This jawbone detects bleed.
I found it 30 years ago or more on a long dead fellow I found it 30 years ago or more on a long dead fellow in another part of Oldfaire.
It has served me many a time.
As we move forward, I intend to use it to gauge how close we are to trouble.
-AABRIA-
What does it normally feel like when you detect bleed through that bone?
-LIAM-
It starts to bite like cold in my hand, the barest sensation of electricity to it, similar but different.
It normally leaves a bit of a welt, but it's worth the pain.
-AABRIA-
The moment you wrap your hands around it even through your leather gloves, you feel it.
That stinging sticking cold.
But what's more, your index finger wrapped around the back of the bone, you feel a little pinprick as a tooth in the back grows longer pressing through the leather piercing into your finger.
There is no need to detect bleed, you are in proximity to it, you're here.
-LIAM-
We are in the frying pan, children.
Watch your step.
-SAM-
We're in a hallway, just a standard hallway, there's not offshoots or anything like that?
-AABRIA-
You see that there are other little areas.
As you were walking down, it probably took five minutes for you to get over here, walking pretty slowly and trying to muffle your steps in the dust.
Lots of offshoots, several collapsed in, no light anywhere else.
The only sound you were hearing was this thud and talking that you've followed to a blind corner that you're about to cross.
-GINA-
Madam Glask has been keeping a close eye on Elsie.
-AABRIA-
What are you looking for?
-GINA-
She still doesn't trust Elsie and is still very scared of what may happen.
Elsie, whatever is behind that door, will you be able to control yourself?
-ASHLY-
You say this thing feeds on mistrust, then I owe you an explanation.
-GINA-
Yes.
-ASHLY-
I'm dying.
I have cullet.
You've probably seen it at The Glass Cat.
-AABRIA-
I'll jump in.
All of you know of cullet.
There's a technical term that no one can bother to remember, but especially lately, in the last six or seven years, following the war, the poorer populations, and neighborhoods, and districts of Newfaire have been falling ill with a degenerative lung disease that as the patient, as the victim coughs, they have a sensation like broken glass inside their lungs, ripping it up, hence the name.
-ASHLY-
I was researching it to help cure some of my clients
I was researching it to help cure some of my clients in the Eaves that didn't want to be associated with what they saw as a degenerate's disease.
And in the course of my research, I became ill myself.
And so I started experimenting.
I tried to find ways to keep the pain at bay but the worse it got, the more desperate I got.
And I started meddling with things that I...
I didn't know about before I met you, Raj.
And I became something unrecognizable.
-GINA-
That beast out there?
-ASHLY-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Need you to take a brain--
-SAM-
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
-- at hearing this.
Having said that, empty your beast pool as it resets.
-SAM-
Beast pool?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm!
-SAM-
Ooh.
-ASHLY-
You don't have a beast pool?
-SAM-
I mean, it's more of a kiddie pool.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
And now that you are returned back to life, if you have any body marks, remove them.
-SAM-
I do not, since the good doctor already healed me.
-ASHLY-
I have spent my time in Candela only around Cosmo and Oscar because I know I'm a liability, I know I'm dangerous, and I've been able to control it and I've been able to control it until you came back.
The one benefit is if I can't control myself in there I'd make a very good distraction and I would encourage you to take the opportunity and run.
-GINA-
That's if you don't attack us Whatever it is that you have going between you two right now, make it clear.
I don't want to risk any more casualties.
We're lucky Oscar's still even here.
-SAM-
Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to lie, that was pretty scary.
-ASHLY-
I'm sorry.
-SAM-
No, it's...
-ASHLY-
I never...
-SAM-
It's something that I knew that you could do, but I-- It hurt just the same.
-GINA-
You were tasked to protect me and the girls.
-SAM-
And I will. And I do.
-ASHLY-
It hasn't-- I thought that I-- I thought I had more control.
-SAM-
Madam Glask, I mean, with all due respect, I know that this is super scary and we got to keep moving, but I've known Doc for a while and you've known her, too, and she's not a threat, she's a victim.
-ASHLY-
I am a threat.
-SAM-
Or maybe she's both.
-AABRIA-
You hear suddenly the speech stop, and shortly thereafter that rhythmic thud and just a (sniffing) quietly from around the corner.
-GINA-
We have no choice. Figure it out.
-ASHLY-
Get behind me.
-SAM-
Should we hide, split up? I'm sorry, I'm honestly, I'm having trouble thinking too clearly right now.
Someone just tell me what to do.
-ASHLY-
Can I-- Ooh, I shouldn't do that, never mind.
-AABRIA-
Hmm?
-ASHLY-
I'll take a brain mark if I do that.
You feel like you're ready to do something.
-LIAM-
I'm going to wheel on an angle slowly while they're having their debate and try to look around the corner.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
Go ahead and give me a Survey roll.
-LIAM-
Oh, I'm not good at that.
But I'll burn a drive and adjust my weight.
-AABRIA-
(snorting cough)
-GINA-
(laughs) Yes!
-LIAM-
Put on my action glasses here.
-ASHLY-
Sport mode.
-GINA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Yes.
-GINA-
Oh, I love them!
-AABRIA-
Gets into sport mode.
-GINA-
So cute.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-NOSHIR-
Means business.
-AABRIA-
Incredible, this was going to be a high stakes roll anyhow.
-LIAM-
So this is Survey.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
With a drive, it's just a straight roll.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Here we go.
-AABRIA-
I will let you know the expectation setting here is on a miss you will be spotted.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
So think, as you approach that corner, you see that there isn't the beginning of hinges for a door.
-LIAM-
Well, maybe we'll burn two drives, then.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
Can I give him an assist? I'll be at the back of the chair and help ease him out, so that if he tells me to, I can pull him back in cover.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Is that a third?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Yes.
All right, I adjust my glasses and lean forward in my chair and try to be quiet as a 97-year-old mouse.
That's a six.
-SAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Beautiful.
You wheel around, get that perfect little view.
Now that you know that someone's controlling the wheels of your chair, you can lean a little more without worrying about squeaking or making a sound.
You see the edge of this cohort.
You see a man, a woman, and a wretched thrall throwing themselves against a massive stone wall trying to find purchase to break through.
It seems like a strange dead end, but the room is probably 40 feet by 30 feet and the ceiling opens up.
You go from this low hallway that couldn't be more than seven or eight feet tall to something that expands up and domes at about, by your guess, maybe 15 feet of height?
-LIAM-
You said a man and a woman and a thrall?
-AABRIA-
Yes, another one of those patients that is bloodying themselves against the wall under orders that they can't help but obey even at the loss of their own physicality.
-LIAM-
And the man and woman are standing back and allowing this.
Is that what I'm seeing?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
The woman is dressed like a nun.
She is beautiful.
Even in that slim profile.
The man has a look on his face, so taut and tight his features smooth over a out-of-fashion, thin mustache, with jet black hair slicked back.
But all the countenance of someone who looks like he couldn't smile or shout if he tried.
A very Serious Man that you recognize from decades ago.
-LIAM-
Somewhere around 90 years?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
It is only because of your full success, and your wisdom, and how often you have seen things that defy imagination and expectation that you are able to face this without taking any kind of mark.
-LIAM-
I quickly shoot a look back to Oscar, and then up to you, Rajan.
-NOSHIR-
I ease him back.
-LIAM-
They were like 50ish feet away?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, they're on the far side of the room, so you've got 50 feet.
But you do also see that while they're facing each other they're not speaking.
They're paused, and the nun was sniffing the air delicately.
You can see the body posture as you're being wheeled back, slowly turning in your direction.
-SAM-
What does that mean? Okay.
-LIAM-
And Oscar?
-SAM-
What?
-LIAM-
It's another.
-SAM-
Oh, two people? Okay.
Three people?
-ASHLY-
Rajan.
-GINA-
Rajan.
-LIAM-
Boy.
-ASHLY-
Do I understand what he just did?
-AABRIA-
You absolutely do.
-ASHLY-
Raj, look at me.
-NOSHIR-
I'm so sorry, little bird, that you had to keep this secret on your own, that I didn't make you feel safe enough to share it with me.
But I will not leave you.
-ASHLY-
We can't handle this if you are on that.
-AABRIA-
"You might as well come in.
I know you're there.
You reek of my favorite flavors.
(unsettling laughter)"
-ASHLY-
Rajan, we can still leave.
-NOSHIR-
No, my darling, we can't.
I am going to ready my Core Sampler and the acid vial that I prepared to open up a lock.
-AABRIA-
I need you to make a Sense roll because you feel it deep inside you, like a buzzing, as whatever is deep within you, the rot that she placed roils.
Though after long years you have believed that you are the master of your monstrosity, they know their mother and they're so close.
-NOSHIR-
I'm going to add two drive.
Oh, can I do that if I have nothing in Sense?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you can.
Burn the Sense now.
-NOSHIR-
A one and a six.
(relieved groans)
-GINA-
He's so good.
-ASHLY-
He's now how to do drama, this guy.
-AABRIA-
That was delightful.
The question is which one are you going to take, the gilded result or the other?
-NOSHIR-
(laughs) I don't think I have much choice in this matter.
I have to take the six.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
You feel it and you feel the beginnings of something crawling up the neck of your fine cut shirt, but it stops, it yields.
You hear her on the other side of this blind corner beginning to growl.
"Don't make me wait," and footsteps begin to move across the room.
-SAM-
What's the play, Raj?
-NOSHIR-
There is no play, Oscar.
We fight for survival.
-LIAM-
Cosmo rolls out into the opening.
-SAM-
Oh!
-GINA-
Cosmo, no.
-AABRIA-
What you see in front of The Serious Man
What you see in front of The Serious Man who has hung behind and just watches serenely.
The woman that walked forward that was a nun, too beautiful, proportions picked along lines that feel more mathematical than possible, and yet she was real and in front of you and inspiring feelings that maybe you have not considered in a very long time.
That falls away.
She releases herself, releases form and continuity and she becomes this thing shifting algorithmically, and she becomes this thing shifting algorithmically, fractally across line, and form, and sinew.
Her limbs lengthen.
You see musculature roping under her skin and the monstrosity of her.
Everywhere you look, wherever your eyes linger, Cosmo, you see a mouth begin to form in the line and shadow of her shoulder and neck, across the fingers that now stretch outward that terminate in too long of claws.
The form of her when she was a nun and human was beautiful.
But the point of her is a Maw and she's moving towards you, smiling with too many mouths and too many teeth.
-LIAM-
I manage to tear my gaze from her for a moment to look at the man in the distance as she closes the distance and say: Hello again.
I grab the brass knob on the end of my wheelchair and pull out an ancient brass dagger couched inside to meet this woman as she attacks.
The blade cuts through my own hand and glows pale blue at her approach.
-SAM-
Oh shit.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
She sees it.
She smells blood.
You've made it easier.
You've opened yourself to her and she loves when you open yourself to her.
She's going to pounce at you.
I need you to try to roll to resist this as a monster flings themselves in your direction gleefully.
-LIAM-
I don't.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LIAM-
I sink the blade using my Ghostblade ability.
I sink the blade using my Ghostblade ability.
-AABRIA-
You take a body mark for using your Ghostblade.
-LIAM-
Yes, you attune a ritual knife to yourself if you coat it in your own blood.
It is particularly effective against magickal beings.
And I stab knowing that she will reciprocate and then some.
-AABRIA-
She falls onto you and folds around you, and you feel the bites of a hundred mouths shifting again, and again, and again.
Then one of the mouths screams as you plunge the ghostblade into it and beyond expectation, she rears back, blood pouring from a set of gapped, jagged teeth emerging from her left breast.
You're going to take two body marks.
-LIAM-
I loll terribly in my chair--
-AABRIA-
"What?"
-LIAM-
-- holding an Ancient Fairen blade of crude blonde.
-AABRIA-
"(screams)"
-ASHLY-
If I may?
-AABRIA-
Yes, please.
-ASHLY-
Well, I actually have a question.
-AABRIA-
Sure!
-ASHLY-
At this point, does Elsie have the capability to bring out the beast on command?
-AABRIA-
Oh, what a fun question.
It's so early in your story, and mechanically, we have a set of triggers that this is the onset; anxiety and panic stack, breath caught, pushes you to a brink.
But I don't know if you've ever chosen it before.
-ASHLY-
I don't know if I have, either.
I'm wondering if I could try--
-AABRIA-
So what if we roll? Yeah.
-ASHLY-
-- to choose now.
-AABRIA-
I'm going to let you tell me what you're going to roll to see if you can summon this yourself.
-ASHLY-
I want to try Focus, because I want to try to see if I can pinpoint and almost try to commune with it, and say that: You're going to come out but you're going to come out and I'm going to be there with you.
-AABRIA-
A concession.
-ASHLY-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
Communication, this feels good.
I think Cosmo's speaking to you in that strange ancient tongue has alighted onto the idea that it can be communicated with and treated with.
Go ahead and make your Focus roll, no one can assist you.
-ASHLY-
That's fine.
-AABRIA-
The stakes are thus: A full success or a miss will allow you to transform, but only one of them will allow you to control it.
-SAM-
Shoot.
-ASHLY-
Okay, this seems like a good chance to use a couple of drives.
-AABRIA-
Burn them now.
Where else would they come in?
-ASHLY-
So I can roll-- Should I just use all my drives? Fuck it.
-LIAM-
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to smoke 'em if I got 'em.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Oh my god.
-ASHLY-
I got a success.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-ASHLY-
A six.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to ignore this gilded die, which was a one.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
I like that you have put it away.
-ASHLY-
I don't want to even look at it or touch it.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Go in the corner.
-AABRIA-
What does it feel like as you begin to spin yourself up into this of your own volition for the first time?
-ASHLY-
So I think the intensity of telling Raj, of seeing him take scarlet, of all the implications that that is, of having killed one of my only friends, and now seeing one of my only other friends being one-on-one with this horrible beast, I think the panic is starting to come.
But it just happened, so there is this sense of: Not again, you don't get to do this to me again, not without me being here, too.
So you can come out, but you're going to play nice.
And I let the transformation begin to happen, but this time, it isn't as intense.
There's almost a calmness to it.
As my arm extends-- [bestial growling]
-- my legs extend, and as I start to transform I say in a voice that is part beast, but part Elsie: Get behind me.
[bestial growling]
As I transform, I'm going to lope into the room and put myself between Cosmo and the Maw.
-NOSHIR-
Beautiful.
-AABRIA-
I will add to that.
You speak, "Get behind me," you think it.
But the beast, this thing that you are, is a thing of stories and tales told to children in the Fairelands for centuries, millennia.
It is not of the language that you use.
So when you speak, only those that speak Ancient Fairen understand you.
The rest hear growls, words, syllables, hard and sharp, filled with great power as the beast within you is pleased at a target.
You see the Maw, this terrible creature, bleeding, confused by her moment of triumph, bleeding, confused by her moment of triumph, takes a step back, confused, concerned for the first time in a very long life.
Before I have your beast attack, is there anything anyone else wants to do or put into play? is there anything anyone else wants to do or put into play?
-GINA-
Yes, in the panic of seeing the beast again I rush over to Cosmo and grab his chair and as fast as I can, run behind Elsie and back to where we came from to get him to safety.
-LIAM-
Thank you, dear.
-GINA-
Yes, Cosmo.
-LIAM-
Thank you.
-GINA-
Are you all right?
-LIAM-
I have seen a few better days.
-GINA-
I take off my shawl and I start compressing his wound.
Stay still.
-LIAM-
It's crimson in seconds.
[bestial growling]
-AABRIA-
Anything from over here?
-SAM-
I am, seeing Cosmo attacked and seeing Elsie change, my instinct is to react, to pounce, to fight back.
But weirdly, I just don't know what to do.
I reach for something at my hip and there's nothing there.
I'm just a little confused.
It's like I've forgotten how this all works.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
So for a moment, I'm just looking around, dumbfounded at what's going on.
-AABRIA-
I will say in that moment, as you search and look and assess your group and assess the room, you make eye contact with The Serious Man, and he narrows his eyes, and recognizes you.
-SAM-
Do I recognize him anymore?
-AABRIA-
Oh.
I think there's a lot of things that you, in that space, have agreed to trade away, but I don't think there's any world in which, even if you thought in that moment it was important to forget and move on, whatever was in there with you knows that it's too important to forget.
You could forget the name of the ship, anyone else in that crew, the people that you traveled with, and worked with, and performed with.
You could forget every other member of your family, and maybe there are some there that you have, but you are not allowed to forget this man, because he is why you're like this.
-SAM-
Seeing his face and his stupid mustache that looks just like mine right now--
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
No, it's very thin.
Yours is like, it's fashionable.
You're giving "Peaky Blinders." It's good.
-SAM-
I'm just overcome with shock and rage.
I guess I'll step forward and I will focus myself, and I will take a ready stance in case he comes closer.
But my eyes are locked on him now, not on the crazy mouth woman.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
Good.
Rajan, I need you to take a bleed.
You are next to her.
It's undeniable.
All of the old history comes crashing back in you and through you, not as trauma remembered, but trauma lived in this moment.
What do you want to do as your friend Elsie, or whatever she is now, truly is now, begins to attack?
-NOSHIR-
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
-ASHLY-
(laughs quietly)
-SAM-
What?
-NOSHIR-
I certainly won't leave her alone.
I have never seen Maw looking like she was on the back foot.
I hear a voice in my head, "Mother Mercy ensconced in white--" I recognize my mother.
"-- tends the hungry day and night." I hear my sister, Aadtika, and I continue the nursery rhyme, which I now know to be a chant of binding, "loving mother to the poor," and I start to loosen my cravat.
"Dare not enter through her door."
-AABRIA-
"No."
-NOSHIR-
"Mind this verse--
-AABRIA-
"Stop."
-NOSHIR-
"-- lest you should meet."
-AABRIA-
"Stop!"
-NOSHIR-
"Please mind her smile--"
-AABRIA-
"Shut up!
-NOSHIR-
"-- and mind her teeth!"
-AABRIA-
(furious) "No!"
-NOSHIR-
"Your name is known to me, Great Maw! Now unbind us from tooth and claw!"
-AABRIA-
Mouths across her body snap shut.
You see this shifting thing begin to freeze and panic.
So the normal way we agreed on resolving your beast was never about a roll, it was never about mechanics, it was about destruction.
One for the one success.
You need to do one great and terrible act to sate the beast and return to yourself.
No roll required.
What do you do?
-ASHLY-
I would like to plunge my claw to plunge my claw into the Maw's chest, and if I can find something approximating lungs, crush them.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You plunge in with an arm, like the knuckles of a gorilla, like the claw of a badger, like the sharp spike of a mantis, and a mouth slowly beginning to freeze itself shut opens enough to scream in defiance and you plunge in past it.
You touch something soft.
There's nothing soft about her like this.
You grab, and you pull, and you crush, and you feel it.
What breath is, what it means.
It is not just air.
It is a soul.
So much of Oldfairen death culture is around breath.
Protect the breath, keep the soul in the body so that it doesn't wander this world.
But you feel it now because you are like it, magickal and wrong.
You crush it.
I want to ask you, you feel the soul beginning to move through your fingertips.
Do you let it go, or do you take that, too? How much of a monster are you right now, Dr. Roberts?
-ASHLY-
I don't think the beast would discriminate.
So if it's possible to crush a soul, my grip tightens.
-AABRIA-
You crush the lungs, you crush the body, you end the life and you feel yourself in tune with the beast.
But this it knows as a predator, lashes out, snaps at the air over the Maw's crumping form, bites the soul, dispels it, destroys it, takes it into itself.
Your beast is a little worse now for it.
The line of the mouth gets a little longer, new rows of teeth, an impressive addition to a terrible creature.
That's it. A terrible act.
If you want to try to hold on and continue a rampage, I'll have you roll again.
But you do feel yourself beginning to calm down and move back to yourself, as The Serious Man in the back, seeing what has been done, is about to bolt past you towards the only exit.
This thrall, even with the thing that compelled it to throw itself away for a cause, for a goal.
There's no tether, there's no magick to break.
This is simply its truth, his truth, and he will continue to bludgeon himself to death against the wall.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to let myself return to Elsie with the understanding that whatever I just did, I think I've made the beast even harder to control, not easier.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I think that makes sense.
You see The Serious Man begin to sprint past the returning form of Elsie, and he's going to try to push past you to get out the door.
-SAM-
I think I will just buckle down, lower my shoulders, and try to run up and tackle him as he goes.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, give me a Strike roll.
-SAM-
Strike? Okay.
-AABRIA-
Knock down is one of the three listed.
-SAM-
Yeah, I will use a drive. Why not?
-AABRIA-
I will say in this moment, you are tending wounds.
If there's any way anyone else wants to assist in this moment, you can.
-NOSHIR-
I'm going after The Serious Man.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-SAM-
I rolled a three on the gilded.
-AABRIA-
Okay, you get your drive back.
(laughter)
-GINA-
It's something.
-AABRIA-
You lower your shoulder and this man, who's maybe only an inch or two taller than you, barrels through you with a strength you didn't expect.
You wheel and turn, please take a body.
-SAM-
Sure.
-AABRIA-
You stand as the last line of defense as Madam Glask and Cosmo are off to the side, tending wounds.
Last chance. He'll get away. What do you do? You know him, too.
How many walks did you go on spotting him and your mother in quiet conversation? Your past really is coming to haunt you tonight and it's getting away.
-NOSHIR-
No. No, he's not.
I take my pointed ring and gouge from shoulder to navel.
-SAM-
Oh my god, everybody's fucked up.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
And tear the remnants of my jacket and shirt, revealing paper and hexagonal cells, a hive built into my body.
-ASHLY-
(gasps)
-GINA-
What the fuck?
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-NOSHIR-
I reach for The Serious Man, specifically his legs.
And I tell my children to feed.
-ASHLY-
(gasps)
-SAM-
Children?
-AABRIA-
These locusts, this sign of pestilence that was inflicted on you by the creature once known as the Great Maw.
So long you thought it was a plague, a curse, a punishment for being too young or naive, not strong enough to stand up against her.
But over time, an affliction can become a part of you.
They are yours.
And for the cost of two bleed, they will follow your directions perfectly.
Where often they only follow your energy Where often they only follow your energy and swarm, and bite, and sting as they would do.
Do you accept this cost?
-NOSHIR-
As I direct my host, parts of the hive crumble and two runes on my tattoos burn into scars.
My claw marks start to travel across my face, entering the eye where something other moves, entering the eye where something other moves, and I collapse, knowing that I've done all I can.
-AABRIA-
And it will be enough.
From his legs, you all watch the direction in which he reaches and points.
The little bit of light given by the hand torch that he was holding and directing the work with, casting shadows across the room, but never on himself.
They swarm at the ankles and move upward ripping away clothing, fine, but maybe a little strangely out of date.
They leave welts, and scabs, and scars as they go moving up, feasting, eating, building on themselves, impossibly.
A hive becomes a swarm, becomes a pestilence, becomes a plague, and this Serious Man is lost within it.
-SAM-
Does it look like he's going to die?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-SAM-
I'm going to call out: Stop, stop, please, you can't do this, you can't let him die, stop!
-AABRIA-
He falls to the ground unconscious.
-GINA-
Who is he to you?
-ASHLY-
Can I, whoo, I have--
-AABRIA-
What do you want to do to try to stop this?
-ASHLY-
Well, I went back to being normal.
-SAM-
Okay. Okay.
-ASHLY-
I have Resuscitate-- Well, did you take a scar just now?
-NOSHIR-
I took, yes.
-ASHLY-
So Resuscitation, when a nearby ally takes a scar, you can make a Focus roll in an attempt to immediately revive them.
-AABRIA-
Oh.
-NOSHIR-
Damn.
-ASHLY-
On a six, it works.
-SAM-
Oh boy.
-ASHLY-
Though they still receive the scar, they're back on their feet.
On a four to five, it'll cost three drive points of your choosing.
-GINA-
Oof.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to do it.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLY-
I used all my drive on the last one, so she's going to be...
-SAM-
Is there a way I can assist?
-LIAM-
Ooh!
-SAM-
Oh, well.
Maybe I don't have to.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
Should I take, I'm going to take the mixed success so I can get a drive back, but it was a five.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLY-
If that matters.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ASHLY-
So I'm going to, seeing what these guys are saying and with what little strength I have left, I'm going to--
-AABRIA-
You still have to spend two other-- You still have to spend three drives on a mixed success.
-ASHLY-
Oh! Then I should just take the six.
-AABRIA-
You should just take the six.
-ASHLY-
I'll take the six.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ASHLY-
So I'm extremely fatigued at this point.
But hearing them shout, I'm going to drag myself over to Raj and flip him over and start whatever doing whatever resuscitation means.
(laughs) Whatever that looks like.
-AABRIA-
I think you are looking at a man whose face has split open.
-SAM-
Oh jesus.
-AABRIA-
The hive in his upper torso has collapsed.
So we can say that this is less of a medical event and more of--
-ASHLY-
Emotional.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. It's an emotional connection.
It's a reaching with the thing beyond what you know exists in this world.
To do so, you will take a brain.
Mostly because this is a stressful situation and you are pushing yourself.
-ASHLY-
Raj, get up.
-SAM-
Call them off, damn it.
-ASHLY-
Raj, wake up!
-NOSHIR-
My right eye opens, and in a kaleidoscopic effect, I can see Elsie in a fractal of nine, and The Serious Man in the background.
I only have the strength to whisper to my children: Death is too easy for him.
You let him live, but barely.
-AABRIA-
Suddenly they all stop, the swarm doubled, tripled, tenfold, the swarm doubled, tripled, tenfold, all drop to the ground dead.
Your hive will be back.
They always come back.
-NOSHIR-
I know.
-AABRIA-
But The Serious Man is alive, but in shock on the ground
-LIAM-
What shape is his flesh in?
-AABRIA-
He's looking pretty bad.
Just ripped up by bugs.
And like all of-- It's like he was attacked by swarms and swarms of different things.
Biting things and stinging things together.
So there are welts of stings and welts of allergic reactions and bites, and chews, and blood.
He's alive and shaking.
-GINA-
As I'm aiding Cosmo, I ask him: Cosmo, who is this man? Why did we let him live?
-LIAM-
It's a full circle today for my father and I.
-GINA-
Your father?
-LIAM-
Oh yes.
-SAM-
I'll go over and examine the body while he's talking.
-GINA-
Is that your father on the floor?
-LIAM-
No.
That one is.
-SAM-
I'll pick up the man and turn him over and see if it's the same face I remember, if it's him, if he's there, if he's alive.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
He is hyperventilating.
He's very shallow breathing and ragged, but he is alive, just barely.
You recognize him from the day you became whatever this is, a ritual gone wrong or right at his hands.
Then in a moment of conflux, as your ship broke, he left, abandoning his work and whatever great magick he called into the world foisted on you.
He loses consciousness, but he's alive in your hands.
-LIAM-
I can scarcely believe it.
-SAM-
Yeah.
Can you-- Doc, are you okay? Can you stabilize him? We need him alive.
He has answers that I need.
-NOSHIR-
The elder Grimm.
-ASHLY-
I'm going to look at Raj, take his face in my hands and check him and then gently put his head down and then walk over to this man, and I suppose I will try to tend to him.
-AABRIA-
There's a lot happening right now.
Just to interject, he is stabilized, but bleeding out in his chair.
-SAM-
Oh, Cosmo is?
-AABRIA-
Yeah
-ASHLY-
Let's do that first, then.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
You have The Serious Man, unconscious and in various states.
He's been brought back, but has taken and is showing signs of damage that stagger the imagination.
I would recommend that you take the spoils of victory here and now and recover in safety somewhere else.
-ASHLY-
That sounds like a good idea.
-LIAM-
I just barely managed to lift this thousands of years old dagger and slot it into my chair.
You hear old metal scrape as it slides back in.
-ASHLY-
Cosmo, Cosmo.
-GINA-
I call Elsie over.
I scream: Elsie, please! I put more pressure on the wound.
-SAM-
I lift up the man, seeing Cosmo hurt, I'll try to shoulder him and carry him out.
We got to go, we got to save him.
We got to go now.
-AABRIA-
It will take effort.
But outside of the danger of The Serious Man and the Great Maw, you have time.
You can make your way back make your way up the gentle slope of dirt and debris that you came down into this random tunnel in Oldfaire, a dead end, but no, not really.
Time it, sneak, hide, make your way back.
Get back to the safe house, the chapter house, The Antiquarian, and recover and figure out just exactly what happened here after you rest.
-NOSHIR-
Can I ask one question? Am I able to get out on my own feet?
-AABRIA-
You are, but barely.
-NOSHIR-
I can't leave a thrall of Maw alone down here to waste away.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-NOSHIR-
So I gently place my hand upon his chest.
I take the Core Sampler and I ram it home and the blade from the tube runs through his front and spikes him to the wall in the back, and I wish him an easy and quiet rest.
-AABRIA-
I think that's a good place to end because only you, with all of your knowledge of what your sister went through, what the Maw is capable of, and maybe the little bit inside of him that remembers himself and what he used to be and can watch himself reduced to whatever this is, will know what great mercy you showed here tonight.
And with that, we will end the first episode.
-ASHLY-
That was just one episode.
-SAM-
That felt like 20.
-GINA-
Oh my gosh.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-GINA-
Oh my gosh.
-SAM-
It's a season.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-GINA-
We got orcas, and mantises, and <i>bees</i>?
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ASHLY-
Oh my!
-GINA-
We're going to a petting zoo, oh my!
-AABRIA-
Oh my!
-GINA-
Jeez.
-LIAM-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay, before we go as we're transitioning out of heavy shit, let's do the thing we didn't really get a chance to do at the top and introduce yourselves--
-ASHLY-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
-- and a little bit about your character to the audience before we go.
We got to get a little aftercare in here.
It is heavy in the club.
-ASHLY-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Let's change the music.
Do we have some Cardi B? No, it's not on my stream deck? Wild.
Let's start with you.
-NOSHIR-
Is this actually happening at the end?
-AABRIA-
Hmm?
-NOSHIR-
Like, we can talk about what has just transpired, or--?
-AABRIA-
Well, this is just a little quick introduction--
-GINA-
On the ride home.
-AABRIA-
-- because no one knows who any of you are.
And then we'll get into all of the fallout from that next time.
-ASHLY-
Great.
-NOSHIR-
I am Noshir Dalal, playing Professor Rajan Savarimuthu, scholar/professor.
-ASHLY-
Slash bee man.
-SAM-
Slash dick.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Slash--
-AABRIA-
He's of beekeeping age.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
It's that old Eddie Izzard bit: Do you-- Do you know that you're covered in bees? (laughter)
-SAM-
I am Sam Riegel, I'm playing Oscar "Cary" Grimm.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
Still trying.
-SAM-
That's it, that's who I am.
And I'm very surprised at everyone's very intense backstory.
(laughter)
-NOSHIR-
Because yours is super chill.
-AABRIA-
Super chill! (laughter)
-SAM-
I think everyone at this table's like, "I've got something good." (laughter)
But nope, it's not as good as the next person.
-GINA-
I am Gina Darling, and I play Madam Glask, owner of the Glass Cat Casino and discrete brothel.
Am I the only normal one here? Who knows? We'll find out.
-NOSHIR-
No such thing, no such thing.
-ASHLY-
Hi, I'm Ashly Burch, I play Dr. Elsie Roberts, and I am half woman, half beast.
-SAM-
In real life.
(laughter)
-ASHLY-
In real life.
-LIAM-
(as Cosmo) I am Liam O'Brien.
I'm playing Cosmo Grimm.
I've been in Candela Obscura for many, many decades, and I work sometimes with my father.
-ASHLY-
(gasps)
-SAM-
Hi.
(laughter)
-GINA-
What is the skincare routine? Amazing.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-NOSHIR-
Long story, long story.
-AABRIA-
Drop the products.
-LIAM-
Very long story.
-AABRIA-
And I have been Aabria Iyengar, your overjoyed storyteller here for the Circle of Tide &amp; Bone.
And we'll see you next time.
Until then, take a deep breath in, out.
-ALL-
(breathe in and out)
-AABRIA-
Is it Thursday yet?

Critical Role Campaign 3 Episode 72 "Phantasmal Parley"
-MATT-
Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Oh!

I don't know this franchise.
Cool, we'll do Travis.
-TRAVIS-
No, I'm in it I can't do it. Somebody else. Over there.
-LAURA-
I don't know anything about it.
-SAM-
Okay, Ashley and Laura.
-MARISHA-
You didn't specify people couldn't participate.
That's unfair!
-SAM-
Okay, here's the rules.
I will list some names, you buzz in and tell me which is the real Mortal Kombat character and you will win a point.
Now, we don't have buzzers, so to buzz in, you must say: Get over here!
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
Or: Finish him! Or: I am Sub-Zero, not Captain Cold!
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) That's not a catchphrase.
-TALIESIN-
Fake fatality, okay.
-SAM-
Okay.
Are you ready?
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Round one.
Who is the real Mortal Kombat character? Mokap, Creed Aventus, Jovan Musk, or Toy Boy?
-ASHLEY-
Get over here!
-SAM-
Okay, who is it?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, good buzz in.
-ASHLEY-
Creed Aventus.
-SAM-
Is the real one?
-ASHLEY-
Sure. (laughs)
-SAM-
Incorrect.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Laura, would you like to steal?
-ASHLEY-
Shit, I think I know what it is.
-MATT-
I know--
-LAURA-
Get over here! Toy Boy.
-SAM-
Incorrect. Those are both men's cologne brands.
(laughter)
As is Jovan Musk.
Mokap is the correct--
-MATT-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Dang it, I was going to say that!
-MATT-
It's just a dude in a Mokap suit.
-ASHLEY-
I was--
-LAURA-
Awesome!
-MATT-
It's not awesome.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Round two! (laughter) (laughter)
But Mortal Kombat 1 is.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
Round two.
(deep) Round two.
Here you do that.
-MARISHA-
Round two.
-TRAVIS-
That was dog shit.
-SAM-
Thank you.
Now I'll list three--
-MARISHA-
Trivia.
-SAM-
Now I'll list three real names.
Which of these four is fake? Ready? Nightwolf.
Daegon.
Afrojack. Meat.
-LAURA-
Get over here!
-SAM-
What is it?
-LAURA-
Daegon.
-SAM-
Incorrect.
-LAURA-
Ah!
-LIAM-
Oh! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
That's crazy.
-LIAM-
Tricksy.
-ASHLEY-
Finish him!
-SAM-
Yes, Ashley?
-ASHLEY-
Um.
(laughs)
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Meat? (laughter)
-SAM-
Incorrect.
-ASHLEY-
Dang it, I had a feeling.
-SAM-
The answer is Afrojack.
He's actually a Dutch DJ and he's 6'10".
-MARISHA-
Oh, is he really? Wow.
-ASHLEY-
All right, all right, all right.
-SAM-
Round three. Someone please get one right.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
He's 6'10"?
-SAM-
I will list guest characters from past games or the upcoming MK 1 game.
Tell me which one was not a guest character.
-LAURA-
Wait, a guest character on what?
-SAM-
They have guest characters come in to--
-TALIESIN-
No!
-MARISHA-
Like cross--
-TRAVIS-
Previous ones have been like Robocop.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Don't tell them!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, sorry.
-LAURA-
Okay.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I think I actually know this. Okay.
-SAM-

Yes, Ashley.
-ASHLEY-

-SAM-
No!
-MARISHA-
He's in the upcoming one.
-LAURA-
Is it Rambo? Is it Rambo?
-SAM-
No.
-MATT-
Ashley, you ruined it.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Have you ever seen Skeletor in Mortal Kombat?!
-LAURA-
I don't know!
-LIAM-
It's Skeletor, you boob!
-LAURA-
I mean, the other ones!
-TALIESIN-
Skeletor should be in Mortal Kombat.
-LAURA-
Skeletor is awesome! All I could picture was Skeletor.
-LIAM-
Next time.
-SAM-
There was no winner, so I will get the prize.
The prize was reading the end of the ad.

-MATT-
And welcome back.
Last we left off, Bells Hells had traversed across Exandria in an instant at the behest of the Voice of the Tempest to one of the many islands that make up the Shattered Teeth.
From beyond the fog curtain, they landed upon the island of Slival.
Upon wandering through the strange dense forests and black rock cliffs and beaches you encountered strange, flying, frog-like, pixie creatures.
You befriended some, and requested a bunch to shit on you.
-SAM-
Uh-huh.
-TRAVIS-
That's right.
-MATT-
You found out about a guardian upon this island in hopes maybe they could guide you to your individual of interest, The Shore Shrew.
-ALL-
(mumbled) Shore Shrew.
-MATT-
You, at the request of these creatures lit a massive bonfire at one of the hilltops, which called the attention of a dangerous, sightless beast that began to attack Chetney and the rest of the group.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking rude.
-MATT-
In defending them and trying to gain control of the battlefield, a massive shadow grew in the sky where a incredibly large, blackened toad creature slammed into the ground and revealed itself to be the living abode of, indeed, Jirana, The Shore Shrew that you were seeking.
After managing to knock away the creature of danger, you were invited into her home and answered a number of your questions, presented some possible opportunities to get to your destination, the island of Kalutha.
You decided the best route was to take an enchanted compass that belonged to a dread captain who runs a ghost ship.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-MATT-
After taking a moment to rest, enjoying some tea and some light conversation the toad homestead bounded across the island and has just deposited you on the island shore, the northeastern shore, to find the rest of your journey.
So here you have stepped out from the mouth into the midday, fog obscured light.
You can hear the ocean waves crashing and can see just beyond the edges of the tree line there, where the water curls up along the beach and then pulls back and away.
-LIAM-
Somebody--
-SAM-
We have the--
-LIAM-
Somebody got that compass?
-SAM-
-- the compass.
-TRAVIS-
I got it.
-SAM-
Want to dip it?
-TRAVIS-
I've also whittled an exact copy, you know, just in case we need to pull a switcheroo or whatever.
-LAURA-
So smart.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
You realize--
-TRAVIS-
I sure am.
-TALIESIN-
You do realize that when you put your exact copy into the water, it's going to float.
Right?
-TRAVIS-
Well, yeah.
-LAURA-
It's more so if we want to steal the compass back and escape, I think.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I think, how's the weight differential here? I'm sure--
-TRAVIS-
It's a little significant, but, you know, <i>they're ghosts</i>.
-ASHLEY-
Like how significant?
-TRAVIS-
So you know, it's just going to fall through their--
-MARISHA-
That's fair.
-TRAVIS-
-- hands. Right?
-TALIESIN-
I'll give you that.
That's okay. That's okay.
-MARISHA-
Also, even if we wanted to steal the compass back isn't their a whole deal that they're like, "Wah-ah, my compass," and they keep following the compass.
-LAURA-
Forever.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, unless things get really weird I'm perfectly okay with keeping it.
-SAM-
Wait. They follow the compass forever?
-TRAVIS-
We're literally making up the rules right now.
(laughter)
It's not backed by science or experience.
-LIAM-
Those rules are very defined.
-LAURA-
The guy who owned the compass previous to Jirana said that he had been chased by them.
They were trying to get him because he had it.
So he pawned off on her--
-SAM-
So they want it back.
-LAURA-
-- and for some reason, they didn't go after her.
-TRAVIS-
That's what she's going to say.
-SAM-
She's landlocked.
-MARISHA-
She's landlocked.
-LIAM-
That house is moving.
-MARISHA-
They chase it when it's on the water.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Probably hard to catch.
-MARISHA-
You got to be in the water.
But then, remember, they were also, she also said that he's looking around for all of his lost treasure and that's part of it.
-LAURA-
Let's call him up.
-TRAVIS-
We also got to keep our eyes out for some beef serpent named Esquala or something, I can't remember.
-LAURA-
Beef serpent?
-TRAVIS-
<i>Reef</i> serpent.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
With an R.
-ASHLEY-
Musk.
-TALIESIN-
Reef.
-ASHLEY-
♪ Reef musk bombs ♪
-TRAVIS-
Reef serpent.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no, that's something else, I'm sorry.
-TRAVIS-
Although, beef serpent's not that bad.
Okay, here comes the compass.
Is it open or is it a lid to it?
-MATT-
This compass, actually, it looks in shape and size like a larger sea navigational compass.
It has an additional layer that clasps over it that you can see elements of it both adjust with a magnetic directional point but it doesn't have any numbers scrawled on it.
As you know, a number of these compasses are specifically enchanted to lead to a specific location.
So it's less about figuring out where you are and more the direction your target is.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-LIAM-
Wait-- Oh, ugh.
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Hmm.
-TRAVIS-
Can I do an investigation, or can I really closely analyze the compass for any initials or notches or pictograms or anything?
-MATT-
Certainly. Make an investigation check.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-SAM-
Once we get the ghost ship here, what do we, how do we convince them to do our bidding? Will they just obey us?
-TALIESIN-
I think that we'll have to come--
-TRAVIS-
17.
-TALIESIN-
-- to some sort of mutually beneficial--
-SAM-
We have money.
We have money, right?
-TALIESIN-
They don't want money. Well, I assume.
I don't know, maybe ghost money, I don't know.
-SAM-
Laudna, what do ghosts like?
-TRAVIS-
Booty.
-MARISHA-
Closure.
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Booty?
-TALIESIN-
Who doesn't like closure?
-SAM-
It's sad.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
17 on the compass check.
-MATT-
It's definitely weathered.
The brass exterior of it has a number of scrapes and gash marks.
There's a little crack on the glass, but it seems to still be functioning.
-SAM-
(heavy exhale)
-LAURA-
(heavy exhale)
-MATT-
You don't see any initials on it, but you do see that it looks like it was probably crafted initially to just be a compass and then had elements added to it before the enchantment was placed within.
That's as much as you can tell.
-TRAVIS-
If we're facing towards the eastern ocean, is that correct?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Facing east.
Which way is it pointing from where we are?
-MATT-
From where you are, it's pointing in a southeastern direction.
-TRAVIS-
Southeastern?! We're down by the Shattered Teeth.
Wow.
Crazy.
-MARISHA-
Maybe he lost it amongst the Shattered Teeth.
What if we just follow where the compass is for a little bit? Maybe we'll find the hidden treasure and then we can use that to barter.
-SAM-
Follow the compass?
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
Because the compass isn't-- As our brains indicated, usually is enchanted to a single--
-MARISHA-
Specific location.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
It's got to be pointing at something.
That's fair. Is it pointing at something? Spin around in a circle.
-ASHLEY-
Spin around, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Turn around.
-SAM-
Can you turn it to something else?
-MATT-
It definitely seems locked in a direction.
-LIAM-
It stays fixed?
-SAM-
But can you move the dial, to select a different direction?
-LAURA-
Wait, what? Do you know how compasses work? (laughter)
-SAM-
Nope!
-TRAVIS-
FCG, normally a compass reads north, so you know which direction you're pointing.
-SAM-
But you said it's pointing southeast.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it's pointed at a specific enchanted location.
-MARISHA-
Above the table, Matt Mercer literally just said it's enchanted to point to a place of interest.
-TRAVIS-
A place of import.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That they want.
-LIAM-
Let's talk about this.
(laughter)
-SAM-
All right, fine.
-TALIESIN-
What's on the map in that direction?
-MARISHA-
That island. I mean, it's where we need to go.
-SAM-
Kalutha.
-LAURA-
What if we just--
But how are we going to follow it? We can't swim in the water.
-SAM-
They're going to give us a ride.
-TALIESIN-
Maybe they want to go there, too.
-TRAVIS-
Literally nothing.
We're over here somewhere, right?
-SAM-
Southeast is--
-TRAVIS-
Southeast is that way.
-TALIESIN-
Are you sure?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Because maybe the map's upside down.
-TRAVIS-
The words are like this.
-TALIESIN-
I'm fucking with you.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, okay.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
What if you do this and do this? (laughter)
Then this appears.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Do we have-- We have a pocket dimension, right? We have a hole?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
We have a hole full of dead people, yes.
-TALIESIN-
That fucking reminds me, we got to clean that up.
-LAURA-
Oh, let's not open that up.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah.
We've got-- (laughs)
-LAURA-
We need them. Wait!
-SAM-
Oh, I was supposed to talk to the dead people.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
While we wait, let's call the pirates.
While we're waiting for them to arrive--
-TRAVIS-
No, I think they'll show up fast.
We put the talking part first.
-LAURA-
We should talk to the dead people, then call the dead.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
You think the ghost people will come that fast?
-TRAVIS-
Probably. They're ghosts.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-SAM-
All right, we'll pull out the dead bodies.
But I was going to say, after we call the pirates, why don't we put the compass in the hole because then they can be like, "Where's our compass?" And we can be like: "We don't have it anymore.
-SAM-
It's not on this plane of existence.
You can use your magics, but you won't find it.
-TALIESIN-
And then what?
-SAM-
And we'll only give it to you if you take us to our destination.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, FCG, this is dastardly.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
A bit aggressive, but all right.
I think that's good.
-SAM-
You taught me well, Ashton.
-LAURA-
You don't think we can just charm them?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, I'm taking it.
-SAM-
We could charm them, too, but-- I don't know.
-LIAM-
We're going to summon them and then, with this thing that they're intent on.
-SAM-
Yeah, be like: We have it, but we won't give it to you until--
-LIAM-
What if they feel it in their intangible undead bones--
-SAM-
They can't if it's in a different dimension.
-LIAM-
But aren't we going to call them with it first?
-SAM-
Yeah, we'll call them and then put it away.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
But once they get the call, they're going to be like, "How'd you call? You got my cell phone."
-SAM-
No, we can say we had it and we'll give it back to you, but with our crazy sorcery, it's not here right now.
-TRAVIS-
Look, we made an amazing one-for-one replica.
We've definitely gotten our eyes on it.
-ASHLEY-
We'd just be like--
-SAM-
That's proof that we know what it looks like.
-ASHLEY-
-- it's right here.
It's right here.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
Who's got the red? Who's got the red? (laughter)
Who's got the red?
-TALIESIN-
I feel like they're the seeds--
-LAURA-
It's a great idea.
-TALIESIN-
-- of a decent plan here.
-LAURA-
Let's talk to dead people.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah. Break out that hole!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
All right, are we near water or--
-LAURA-
What are we even supposed to ask these dead people?
-SAM-
I don't remember who these guys are. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
Yeah, who did we kill?
-TRAVIS-
It's all the Grim Verity that we beat, right?
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's right.
-MATT-
The Grim Verity?
-MARISHA-
Ratanish and stuff.
-TRAVIS-
Or--
-MATT-
Ruby Vanguard?
-MARISHA-
Paragon's Call. Right?
-LAURA-
Ruby Vanguard.
-TALIESIN-
Paragon's Call.
-TRAVIS-
Whatever the red color's--
-TALIESIN-
There's also General Ratanish is in there, too.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's right.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, we were going to talk to him and be like, "What's your plan?"
-TALIESIN-
Then we are going to put that body in the ocean and let it go away.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
A proper burial at sea.
-TRAVIS-
So they can come back later.
-TALIESIN-
Sure.
-SAM-
All right, pull them out, Ashton.
I'll get my spell ready.
-TALIESIN-
Are we near water or anything or--
-SAM-
We're right at the water.
-TALIESIN-
All right, all right.
-LIAM-
That's where the frog deposited us.
-LAURA-
Yes, all right.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to find somewhere flat--
-LAURA-
What was I going to say?
-TALIESIN-
-- where the water, the tide's not going to--
-SAM-
I don't know!
-TALIESIN-
I assume there's somewhere flat that the tide's not--
-TRAVIS-
Don't have it prepared?
-MATT-
There is a stretch of--
-SAM-
I have it prepared.
-MATT-
-- darker beach that--
-LAURA-
No, I had something that I was about to say--
-MATT-
-- stretches for about 20 or so feet before it hits the water.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, yeah.
I don't want to be one of those--
-MARISHA-
Maybe it'll come back.
-TALIESIN-
-- terrible videos.
All right.
-TRAVIS-
You literally forgot what you were about to say?
-TALIESIN-
Flatten it out and I'm going to take everything.
-LAURA-
Like 10 minutes ago.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take them out.
-MATT-
Oh, I see what you mean. For the hole.
-TALIESIN-
For the hole.
-MATT-
For the hole.
-LIAM-
You need a flat surface.
-MATT-
You have to search a bit and find a bit of sea-worn rock where it's not a perfectly flat surface, but it's just enough of a flat surface that it bends over and creates the hole.
But it takes you about an hour to find the right place for it.
-LAURA-
Could we flatten out some sand?
-TALIESIN-
I was going to say.
We can pound sand or no?
-MATT-
(sighs) Sand, unfortunately, is porous.
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-MATT-
It needs a relatively a majority contact with a specific flat material.
-TALIESIN-
No, respect.
-MATT-
So I'll say you do find a rock that it's been battered by the ocean and up to the point where it has a smooth space, so you can finagle it and make it work.
-TALIESIN-
We also have a pair of boots that have never been identified in there.
-SAM-
Oh, I can do that as well.
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's right.
They were fancy.
-SAM-
Oh, can I?
-TALIESIN-
So, well, we can wait if we need to.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to open it up.
I'm going to pull them out.
I'm going to take off as much, all the armor and otherwise, and--
-SAM-
Make them look real sexy.
What am I asking these guys?
-TALIESIN-
I don't know.
-LIAM-
Oof, they're ripe.
-MARISHA-
You have five.
-LAURA-
What's your plan?
-SAM-
I have five questions.
"What's your plan?"
-LIAM-
"What were you doing with Imahara?"
-MARISHA-
Well, we know that.
-TRAVIS-
"Where's Ludinus?"
-LIAM-
But for what?
-MARISHA-
He was making weapons for the Paragon's Call.
-SAM-
We know where Ludinus is.
He's on the moon.
-ASHLEY-
Brumestone nullifiers or something like that?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
I guess we'll just see if there's something else.
-TRAVIS-
Are those items that we got from Jirana in the inventory?
-MARISHA-
Let's see what else.
-MATT-
They should be.
-TRAVIS-
We can add them? Okay.
-LIAM-
"Did you like being a member of the Paragon's Call?"
-SAM-
"What do they pay?"
-ASHLEY-
Maybe you could say like, "What were you having Imahara Joe make explosives for?" I don't know.
Or something like that.
Did we already know that?
-MARISHA-
Well, because they were doing--
-SAM-
They were blowing up the skyships.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's right.
-MARISHA-
They were blowing up ships.
-MATT-
To remind you, dead creatures are not compelled to tell the truth, especially if they identify you as an enemy or a hostile, so--
-SAM-
I'm going to be really sweet to them.
-MARISHA-
Well--
-SAM-
Oh, we could put on-- Do we have any Paragon's Call robes?
-LAURA-
I could style my hair like my mom.
-TALIESIN-
You can just blindfold them.
-SAM-
You could.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-SAM-
You could be your mom.
-TALIESIN-
Never mind, that's better.
-ASHLEY-
That's a good idea.
-SAM-
That's really cool.
-TALIESIN-
I like that.
-SAM-
Do we--
-MARISHA-
I can make a Minor Illusion.
What if I illusion your mom and puppet her.
-LIAM-
A little mom?
-MARISHA-
And then you talk.
-SAM-
Like you move the mouth and you talk?
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
That seems like it'll work.
-LAURA-
That's definitely way better than just styling my hair.
-SAM-
We just style your hair and put you in some of their robes?
-LAURA-
Sure.
-SAM-
What does she wear normally?
-LAURA-
Just regular clothes.
Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
Not like red?
-LAURA-
I don't think she was in red.
-MATT-
No, last you saw her--
-LAURA-
She was in a trench.
Wasn't she?
-MATT-
She was wearing a dark brown trench coat, yeah.
-SAM-
Do we have one of them?
-TALIESIN-
I do have a-- It's a little much, but it's a sleeveless black trench with a red inter--
-LAURA-
Yeah, let's switch it out. I'll put it on.
-TALIESIN-
Into it. (grunts)
-MATT-
(chuckles)
-LAURA-
Hair in a braid.
-SAM-
Laudna, help her with her hair.
-MARISHA-
(uncertain murmurs)
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
And then...
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
You can stitch a skull into a rat and this is a problem.
-MARISHA-
I did, I wasn't around little girls for a long time, but I don't know how to braid, really.
-SAM-
Should I do the main guy, General Ratanish, or one of the underlings? I feel like we should practice on one of the underlings.
-LAURA-
Underlings first?
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
You can do a couple of--
-SAM-
I think a couple of folks.
-LIAM-
How many do we have?
-LAURA-
I don't have any idea what the fuck I'm asking about.
-SAM-
That's okay.
-LAURA-
It's just like: Hey, it's me.
-TALIESIN-
Who are they working for?
-LAURA-
What are we doing?
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
"I'm your boss.
Tell me what my plan is."
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
I mean, think about it.
-TRAVIS-
"What was I last doing on the moon when you saw me?"
-SAM-
All right, I will cast the incantation.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
I will raise the spirits of the dead--
-TRAVIS-
You are so good at this.
-SAM-
-- and speak to one of the underlings.
Please forgive me for corrupting the fates, Changebringer.
I'll cast the spell.
-MATT-
Okay, is this someone of the standard, nearby, bruiser types? Is this the druid? Which bodies did you take?
-SAM-
Oh! Druid sounds good.
They might know some stuff.
-TALIESIN-
We took everything that was a problem.
-MATT-
Right, but which body are you doing?
-SAM-
Druid, I'll do druid.
-TALIESIN-
Pull the druid out, I imagine.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
They least know some stuff.
-TALIESIN-
I'll take the other. Yeah, I'll drag them--
-SAM-
Oh, let's all hide so she only sees--
-LAURA-
Oh, so it's just me.
-SAM-
Druid. I mean, you.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
All righty.
So you pull over the druid, its body broken from the impact of plummeting from the sky in its final moments in Bassuras, the jaw open in this agape, terrified final moment expression of pain in the eyes.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's right.
-MATT-
Still wide, if the muscles themselves are lax.
Stench already isn't great.
But you pull the body out onto the beach and you leave your incantation, and you watch as the mist that's rolling by, some of it seems to swirl a bit and gather before (air sucking) going into the open mouth.
The druid's chest expands, the eyes (stiff creaking) look over and lock in with yours, and the jaw twitches, like it's trying to begin to make noise but has no purpose to yet.
But the spell has taken hold.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
So you're standing there with me?
-SAM-
Well, guess I had to cast the spell and now I'll quietly back away.
-TRAVIS-
(wheel squeaking)
-SAM-
Turn my attention to Imogen.
-LAURA-
I'm going to look at the dead druid.
You failed your mission.
Where's Thull?
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-SAM-
I should have--
-ASHLEY-
Guidance!
-SAM-
-- given you some Guidance or something ahead.
-LAURA-
Yeah, you really should have.
-SAM-
This is why we practice.
-LAURA-
19.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
19.
-LAURA-
Oh wait, no.
That's a lie. 21.
-MATT-
21. Okay.
-SAM-
You deceived.
-LIAM-
You really did deception.
-LAURA-
You deceived.
(laughter)
-MATT-
The eyes-- (stiff creaking)
-ASHLEY-
Double deception.
-MATT-
-- shift over back to you, and you asked it?
-LAURA-
Where is Thull?
-MATT-
(dry, raspy gasp) "She remains at the Key."
-SAM-
The Key.
-ASHLEY-
Remains at the Key.
-SAM-
Okay, okay, okay.
Key.
-TRAVIS-
Here at the wall.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
In my head, I will say to FCG: What the fuck else am I supposed to be asking about?
-SAM-
They told me to ask about Ludinus, what was the plan?
-LAURA-
(sighs)
-TRAVIS-
Is-- (stammers excitedly)
-SAM-
What else were we supposed to ask?
-TRAVIS-
Predathos, Predathos.
-SAM-
(pigeon coos) Predathos.
What-- I don't know.
-MARISHA-
Is it gaining strength?
-SAM-
Yeah, is it time? I don't know. Timeline?
-LAURA-
How many have come over?
-MATT-
"I don't know.
I saw a hundred or more."
-LAURA-
Did you ever speak to Ludinus?
-MATT-
"No, just watched him."
-SAM-
What about the defenses at ground zero? I don't know why a--
-LIAM-
How much time is left?
-SAM-
That's a good one, too.
-ASHLEY-
That's a good one.
That's a good one.
-SAM-
(pigeon coos) (chuckling)
-LIAM-
Just New York City pigeons--
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Hold it, Matt!
-LIAM-
-- on this tropical island.
-TRAVIS-
Hold that fucking face.
(laughter)
Tears start coming down.
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
How much time until we strike?
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
(laughs) A dead person's confused.
-TRAVIS-
(continues laughing)
-MATT-
"I don't know."
-SAM-
Good, good.
-MARISHA-
Was that three questions?
-LAURA-
No, that was four.
-SAM-
That was four.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, it was four.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-SAM-
This is going about as well as it could go.
-LAURA-
Did--
-TRAVIS-
Predathos.
-LAURA-
What?
-SAM-
What about Predathos?
-TALIESIN-
What happened to--
-LAURA-
What about Predathos? I can't just ask: "So, Predathos--
-TRAVIS-
Is he loose?
-MARISHA-
Is he gaining strength?
-TRAVIS-
What's Ludinus doing next?
-MARISHA-
Is he going to break free?
-SAM-
What are Predathos' weaknesses?
-TRAVIS-
What were they--
-LAURA-
So anyway, have you talked to Predathos? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Imahara Joe?
-LAURA-
What about him?
-SAM-
We know that already.
-LAURA-
Uh-huh.
-TRAVIS-
I guess so, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Why are they blowing up the ships, though?
-MARISHA-
Because they're resistance.
-LAURA-
Because the ships are going to go attack them.
-MARISHA-
We know this.
-TALIESIN-
So cast right--
-MARISHA-
(laughs) We know this.
-LAURA-
I'm just staring at you in your head.
I'm just staring at you.
-MATT-
"(choked rasping)"
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
(laughs) We can't just leave it at four.
-LAURA-
I just let him sit here.
-TRAVIS-
What's the greatest threat?
-SAM-
To our organization?
-LAURA-
What is the greatest threat to our organization?
-MATT-
"They've mentioned unity."
-LAURA-
Unity.
-MATT-
"Keep them scattered.
(dry gasp)" (thuds)
-SAM-
That was a good one.
-LAURA-
That was good, that was good.
-MATT-
The spell releases.
-LAURA-
Jeez Louise.
That was pathetic.
-MARISHA-
I didn't get it.
-SAM-
I didn't get the first couple words either, but it seemed like unity was--
-LAURA-
They mentioned unity.
-MARISHA-
Unity.
-LAURA-
They're trying to keep them scattered.
-MARISHA-
Scattered? Okay.
-LAURA-
So--
-MARISHA-
Is that why we got shunted?
-LAURA-
Maybe.
Maybe they're trying to cause dissension among the gods, Maybe they're trying to cause dissension among the gods, the different--
-SAM-
Or keep the mortals from gathering and organizing, and that's why they're blowing up all these ships and--
-LIAM-
Stopping communication.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Mm-hmm.
We need to figure out a way to send messages to gather folks, like a chain letter.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
What's a--
-SAM-
You write a letter to one person.
If they don't send it to 10, bad luck shall--
-TRAVIS-
Should we ask for a hidden--
-ASHLEY-
They die?
-TRAVIS-
-- or secret way to the key?
-LIAM-
Send a message?
-TALIESIN-
There's some way that they're communicating.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, where's the secret entrance?
-TALIESIN-
They have some way around.
-SAM-
Oh yeah, do they have a way of communicating?
-TALIESIN-
Clearly, they're organized.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah, they are, aren't they?
-SAM-
All right, if we raise up General Ratanish, why don't we do a little bit better planning on what we're going to ask?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we probably should do that.
-MARISHA-
Do we have another dead person?
-LAURA-
Is there somebody else that-- I didn't think about the fact that why would I be asking the questions if I'm my mom?
-LIAM-
Right? You're the boss.
-LAURA-
Why am I asking them?
-TRAVIS-
Because--
-SAM-
Maybe you can say--
-TRAVIS-
-- you drank a lot last night.
-SAM-
Yeah, I was going to say you bonked your head and can't remember some of the details.
-ASHLEY-
You're just making sure--
-TRAVIS-
As a good and dutiful soldier, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
You're interrogating them.
-ASHLEY-
You're testing.
You're making sure he's--
-SAM-
Ooh, testing's good.
-TRAVIS-
Before you bring them back.
-LIAM-
Oh, okay.
-TALIESIN-
Proves that they know their shit.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Prove you know and then you can go on your merry way to death
-LAURA-
Or back to life.
-ASHLEY-
Or back to life if you do a good job.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Back to death ♪ TRAVIS and ASHLEY: ♪ Back to reality ♪
-SAM-
All right, we're going to ask them if they have any special means of communication.
-ASHLEY-
Guidance.
-LAURA-
Yeah, thanks.
-SAM-
We're going to ask them if they have any--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
Yeah, thanks.
-SAM-
-- special defenses at ground zero maybe? I don't know.
-LAURA-
Sure, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Secret ways in or out.
-SAM-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
How do you get in and out of-- That's all we got. (laughs)
-LAURA-
What about our secret entrances? Do you have them guarded? Should I act like I already know about our secret entrances?
-SAM-
Yeah, of course.
-LIAM-
Or maybe you could fudge it like you've been split off from their forces and are a little out of the loop?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Yeah, that's why you would want to communicate.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Maybe something went wrong and you got shunted.
-LIAM-
Right.
You've been tied up with the Dawnfather's forces.
-LAURA-
All right.
-LIAM-
Something like that.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-LIAM-
But better.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Maybe if we ask the greatest threat again and specify unity.
Do they mean the gods? Do they mean mortals?
-LAURA-
Or I can be like, "Our greatest threat is unity."
-SAM-
Clarify.
-LAURA-
Clarify.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Unity of what?
-TRAVIS-
Expand.
-LIAM-
Don't you think--
-TALIESIN-
I would like a number.
-SAM-
All right, we got four questions.
The fifth question can be just potpourri.
-LAURA-
I didn't write them down.
-SAM-
I got them.
-LAURA-
Okay, you feed them to me.
-TALIESIN-
We can also ask what happened to the other two.
-SAM-
Other two?
-TALIESIN-
The monk and the other one.
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Oh!
-SAM-
The dirt wizard and the monk.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah.
-SAM-
Yeah, that's good.
-LIAM-
Yeah, what happened to those two?
-SAM-
Great, all right.
-LIAM-
The Dwendalian Empire folk sniffing around.
-TRAVIS-
Sad sacks of--
-LIAM-
Yeah, terrible.
-TRAVIS-
-- allies.
-SAM-
I will place my coin on General Ratanish's forehead and imbue in it--
-LAURA-
What am I starting?
-SAM-
-- the magic of life, but brief life.
-MATT-
Okay.
The ruined torso of Ratanish lays sprawled out on this beach, the cold mist blowing through.
As you put the coin to the forehead, that mist swirl happens once more and the chest rises.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Yeah.
-MATT-
(exhales)
-LIAM-
Oh, that's right, did you jelly the head?
-TRAVIS-
He's pissed even in death.
-TALIESIN-
Chest is jelly; the head's fine.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
The eyes like (squelching).
You hear the congealed liquid--
-ALL-
(sounds of protest)
-TRAVIS-
You don't need to do it!
-MATT-
-- straining against the dried eyes.
-TRAVIS-
Jeez.
-TALIESIN-
I am sitting behind this, just enjoying the view of the back.
-MARISHA-
I know, I know.
-LIAM-
Stupid, talented voiceover.
-MATT-
"(strangled gurgling)"
-LAURA-
Congratulations, you fell to a group of weaklings.
Luckily, our master is forgiving.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
We can bring you back if you prove yourself.
-ASHLEY-
That's good, hat's good.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-ASHLEY-
That's good, that's good.
-ALL-
You got Guidance.
-SAM-
G-g-guidance!
-TRAVIS-
(blows raspberry)
-LAURA-
Okay, that's 11 plus nine.
-SAM-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay.
-LIAM-
That's a 12.
Eight and four is 12.
-LAURA-
12 plus nine.
-SAM-
That's 21!
-LAURA-
21 again.
-MARISHA-
Blackjack.
-TRAVIS-
Plus five.
-LAURA-
Because?
-TRAVIS-
Because I'm naked.
-LIAM-
Carry the three.
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-MATT-
He's just looking at you.
-SAM-
You haven't asked a question yet, so maybe that's okay.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
In your head: What am I asking?
-SAM-
Sorry, sorry.
So, means of communication that they use.
Secret ways of communicating-- (laughter)
-- that they use.
-MARISHA-
Over long distance.
-LIAM-
You've been cut off, right?
-LAURA-
Tell me how we communicate.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"The old fashioned way.
This solstice has scrambled us all."
-SAM-
The old fashioned way?
-LAURA-
Yeah, just--
-TALIESIN-
Insight check.
-MARISHA-
They don't--
-LAURA-
Yeah, insight check him.
I feel like he's lying.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-SAM-
The old fashioned way is they sleep with each other.
-TALIESIN-
Eight.
-MATT-
It seems like a dead person answering a question.
-LAURA-
Can I Detect Thoughts on a dead person that's being--
-MATT-
There is no conscious brain or mind here.
This is a spell that is recalling memories and personality, but it's its own separate conjuration, so no, you cannot.
-TALIESIN-
There's technically no one there anymore.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
The house is empty.
-MATT-
This is the body remembering an echo of who once occupied it.
-LIAM-
These are memberberries.
-MATT-
Yes. "'Member a question you ask?"
-LIAM-
'Member Ludinus?
-SAM-
We were going to ask them about any secret entrances or defenses.
-LAURA-
Tell me how you've protected-- How we've protected our entrances into the Key.
-MATT-
"We've manned them as requested, and
"We've manned them as requested, and the moon folk have kept eyes as well." "the moon folk have kept eyes as well."
-SAM-
Kept eyes as well.
-LAURA-
As well.
Is that what you said? Okay.
-LIAM-
That's another question.
-LAURA-
No! Oh no! Ah!
-ASHLEY-
What was the first bit?
-SAM-
I didn't catch the first part.
-LAURA-
I didn't hear the first part he said, either.
-SAM-
God, this spell is the worst.
-TALIESIN-
It was, the soldiers have been moved, as you requested.
-LAURA-
Oh.
Great. Good.
-SAM-
That was defenses. We got secret entrances, maybe? Or something about unity, specifically specifying who we're trying to keep un-united?
-LAURA-
Goddamn it.
-LIAM-
The Empire siblings?
-LAURA-
You were in charge of keeping rebellions down, yes? That was a question, shit! Fuck! (laughter)
-MATT-
"Partially." (laughter)
-LAURA-
Fuck!
-MARISHA-
Partially? Is he going to elaborate? No, he's not.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah, fucking amazing. There you go.
Stare him down, stare him down! (laughter)
Boil him down! (laughter)
-SAM-
Is this "Curb Your Enthusiasm"?
-TRAVIS-
Here we go.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Okay, okay. Shit!
-TRAVIS-
A little crab.
-SAM-
Then the monk and the wizard.
Wait, was that three questions?
-TRAVIS-
He didn't even answer.
-ASHLEY-
That was three.
We have two more.
-SAM-
We have two more, so you can still press on about unity or secret entrances, or the monk and the wizard.
-LAURA-
(sighs)
-TRAVIS-
Unity, entrances, monk and the wizard.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Which?
-MARISHA-
I agree.
-LAURA-
I don't know how to phrase, "Where are our entrances that are secret?" Do you know what I mean?
-TRAVIS-
How would Jester phrase it?
-LAURA-
I mean, that's fully-- I'm going full Jester.
-SAM-
You're trying to get back there as fast as you can.
You need to know where the latest secret entrances are.
-TRAVIS-
You got separated.
-TALIESIN-
That's assuming that they've been changing.
It's tense in there.
-LAURA-
As you can see, I've been separated--
-TRAVIS-
(fart sound)
-LAURA-
-- from our forces.
Fuck off.
-SAM-
Right.
-LIAM-
Your husband made a fart sound! (laughter) (laughter)
-LAURA-
Tell me about our entrances into the Key.
-SAM-
Please?
-LAURA-
Can you? (laughter)
-SAM-
She's become Yoda.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
(like Yoda) Me want to the secret entrances, tell you? (laughter) (laughter)
-LAURA-
This is the worst!
-TRAVIS-
(like Yoda) Can you? (laughter)
-LIAM-
(like Yoda) Monk and a wizard, do you?
-MATT-
"You have many tricks up your sleeve."
-LAURA-
Yes, I do.
-MATT-
"The main pit entrance is easy."
-LIAM-
Main pit entrance?
-MATT-
"Otherwise--" Make a deception check again.
-ASHLEY-
Still need Guidance?
-LIAM-
He's putting two and two together in his dead skull.
Come on. Come on.
-LAURA-
Fuck, shit, balls, motherfuck, shit.
14.
-MATT-
14?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
"They were closed behind us as a precaution."
-TALIESIN-
Insight.
-ASHLEY-
Should I insight check him?
-SAM-
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that was weird.
-SAM-
Ashley's doing it, too.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
-SAM-
Monk and the wizard!
-LIAM-
Not for me.
-LAURA-
Everybody's is balls.
-ASHLEY-
17.
-SAM-
What?
-ASHLEY-
17.
-SAM-
You have a plus 13 on insight? Holy shit!
-LAURA-
What?
-SAM-
Oh, a whisper!
-ASHLEY-
Oh, oh, oh! Me?
-SAM-
Guys, what do we have to plug?
-LAURA-
God!
-SAM-
What's coming out this week? Mortal Kombat?
-MARISHA-
Queen by Midnight.
-TRAVIS-
Mortal Kombat one-shot.
-MARISHA-
Mortal Kombat one-shot.
-TALIESIN-
Play the game, it's great.
-SAM-
Queen by Midnight.
-TALIESIN-
It's super fun.
-SAM-
Queen by Kombat.
Mortal Queens.
-LIAM-
Mortal Queenbats!
-ASHLEY-
I look at you like, get in my head.
-LAURA-
I'm in your head.
What?
-ASHLEY-
He, I don't think, is being truthful.
He's being a little sassy with you.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I think he knows.
-ASHLEY-
Which I feel like you probably picked up on. Okay.
-SAM-
Intimidate him!
-MARISHA-
Punch him in his dead face!
-ASHLEY-
Say, I'm going to kill you!
-SAM-
Punch him in his dick.
-TALIESIN-
What the hell? What are we--
-LAURA-
Huh?
-TRAVIS-
Pull part of your body with your dick, punch it.
-LAURA-
I'm going to use my Mage Hand.
I'm going to rip the head off of the dead body and bring it up in the air so it's looking at me in the eye.
-MATT-
Tongue's kind of (lolling).
-LAURA-
What happened to the two, the wizard and the monk?
-MATT-
"Probably dead."
-LAURA-
Just like you.
-SAM-
You did so well.
-LAURA-
That was fucking terrible!
-ASHLEY-
You did really good.
No, no, no, it was great.
-SAM-
You did great! If it makes you feel better, why don't you take his head and use it like a skipping stone across the ocean?
-LAURA-
I do that.
-MATT-
(laughs) (thudding splashes)
-TRAVIS-
Big monster's like-- (roars) (screaming) (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Should we do the other one?
-LAURA-
God!
-SAM-
We're doing more?
-ASHLEY-
Do we have another one?
-LAURA-
No, don't make me do that again. Somebody else can do it.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to deal with some of this shit, anyway.
-SAM-
There's nothing else to glean.
-LAURA-
There's nothing--
-SAM-
These are low level punks.
-LAURA-
But we do know that there were secret entrances.
We just don't have the locations.
-ASHLEY-
They closed-- okay.
-MARISHA-
We know that there are soldiers and moon folk.
-LAURA-
And a hundred strong had come over.
-MARISHA-
And a hundred--
-SAM-
Reilorans.
-LAURA-
Reilorans had come over.
-TRAVIS-
That's the moon folk, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
They communicate the old fashioned way.
-LAURA-
That's great.
-ASHLEY-
By pigeon, I guess.
-SAM-
Uh-huh. Telegraph.
-MARISHA-
That Otohan Thull remains at the Malleus Key.
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's good info.
-LAURA-
That is good info.
-SAM-
You did great!
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to go clean up our mess, if you don't mind.
I'm going to bundle up whoever's left and grab the head and walk a little bit down towards the shore, and I'm going to remove the armor, and I'm going to start tossing the meat chunks into the water, and then I'm going to beat the metal parts until they are not recognizable as armor.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to throw them in the water, too.
Give them a nice big throw.
-MATT-
Got it.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, wait, wait.
-TALIESIN-
What?
-ASHLEY-
Can you give me a couple of Ratanish's molars? Just a couple teefies.
-TALIESIN-
Happily.
-ASHLEY-
Thank you.
-MATT-
Put down a couple of Ratanish molars in your inventory.
-LAURA-
I did throw the head into the sea.
-LIAM-
How'd you do that? She pulverized--
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's right.
-TALIESIN-
I thought you skipped it, you didn't-- I thought you skipped it down the beach.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah, no.
-ASHLEY-
It's fine.
-MATT-
Water's not too-- Well, it's kind of chilly.
You can jump out there and grab it, if you want.
-LIAM-
Look, it's like 15 feet out floating right over there.
-ASHLEY-
I'll go grab it.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
It came back in.
-MATT-
All righty.
-SAM-
All right, should we call the ghost pirates?
-LAURA-
Uh-huh.
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to need my jacket back.
-MARISHA-
We call the ghost pirates by taking the compass and sticking it in the water?
-LAURA-
Sticking it in the water.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Sure.
I don't know anything about the sea.
Is this a good place for a boat to land? I guess this is a ghost boat. It doesn't matter.
-TALIESIN-
It's not like it's going to run ashore or anything.
Let's make sure that we're a bit far--
-MARISHA-
This is a ghost boat.
-LAURA-
How do we step on a ghost boat?
-SAM-
The boat's real, but the ghosts aren't?
-MARISHA-
Correct.
-LIAM-
How is everybody feeling at the moment?
-MARISHA-
I don't know, I'm just speculating.
-TRAVIS-
That's true, that's true.
-SAM-
You're an expert! You're dead!
-TRAVIS-
Some of us are figgity-fucked up.
-LIAM-
Hold up, hold up.
Before we start to travel with more dead people, is everyone okay? Do you want to take a couple hours?
-LAURA-
We took a short rest in the toad.
-SAM-
We did.
-LIAM-
Yeah. I'm good, but--
-SAM-
I'm good.
-MARISHA-
I don't think I got messed with.
-TRAVIS-
I don't think I did.
-TALIESIN-
Let's see where I'm at.
-LAURA-
I regained my spells from the vial.
-SAM-
By the way, does anyone want that, what's it called?
-TALIESIN-
We have a bunch of vials.
-SAM-
Pearl of Power?
-LAURA-
Yeah?
-MARISHA-
We had tea.
-SAM-
Do you want that?
-MATT-
Short rest was inside the toad.
-LAURA-
Oh wait, you have to attune to it.
-SAM-
Yes, you do.
-TRAVIS-
Did I not take it for a reason? I wasn't on watch or anything, right?
-MATT-
No.
-TRAVIS-
I'll take it.
-LAURA-
I think I'm full up on attunement.
-MATT-
Go for it.
You can do that as well.
-TALIESIN-
I've got two rages left, I think. That's pretty good.
-LIAM-
I can make flowers twice.
-LAURA-
(laughs) So, not so much?
-LIAM-
Mm-hm.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'll live.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
All right, let's dip the dip stick.
-MATT-
He's doing his make up short rest here.
-TALIESIN-
I assume that our little flat plane is close enough away from the water that we can get to the hole, since I haven't folded it up yet.
We can get to the hole and toss the compass in there if we need.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Chetney's having a sit down.
-TALIESIN-
If we need.
You're doing this?
-TRAVIS-
Compass--
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
-- of the Dread Captain Novos--
-TALIESIN-
For fuck's sake.
-TRAVIS-
-- which is Sovon backwards.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Grant us--
-LIAM-
He cracked the code.
-TRAVIS-
-- thy booty.
Dip in the water.
-MATT-
You place it into the water. Sploosh.
You pull it out, and as the water drips off of it, where it hits the water, this renewed thick mist (billowing).
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-MATT-
Billows out from where it made contact and spills out.
You can see it gives this thick layer of low-hanging mist that begins to spread across the beachside in front of you.
The fog, at this time of day where it burns back a little bit, you can't see the horizon, but definitely you have a better view of many of the rocks of the inlet.
100, 200, 300 feet out, it begins to close in even further.
The temperature noticeably gets colder, and where it was a comfortable maybe low 60s, it almost immediately begins to crawl into the 50s, to the 40s.
You begin to see your breath in the air.
-LAURA-
Oh, he's got a bag of holding, right?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, bag of holding.
That's fair.
-TRAVIS-
We've got two of them.
-ASHLEY-
What happens if we put the portable hole?
-LAURA-
We've got two holes! (laughs)
-LIAM-
Do I hear anything through the fog with a 29?
-MATT-
With a 29?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
You hear nothing.
-LIAM-
Except Imogen talking about her holes.
-LAURA-
Sorry!
-MATT-
Other than the adjusting of waves crashing on the shore, and the winds blowing through, you hear nothing.
What you see--
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy!
-MATT-
-- noiselessly, is a shadowed shape beginning to breach the distant fog bank that obscures and encloses your vision.
You begin to see, as it cruises at an angle from the outer portion of what water you can see, the bow of a massive ship.
As it begins to cruise up, you can see chains hanging off the side, some thick, like an overgrown moss that seems to cluster up this damaged ship as it continues to push through.
You see masts come into view, the sails tattered and hanging in strips, and you see a handful of dark shapes along the bow as it silently approaches.
-SAM-
Who's going to talk to these guys?
-TRAVIS-
I got it.
-MATT-
And closer.
-SAM-
Let me give you some sort of a boost.
-LIAM-
That was crazy.
She said use the compass, and you used the compass, and they just came!
-SAM-
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on you and give you, what's it called?
-MARISHA-
Charisma, the charisma one.
-SAM-
Yeah, the charisma.
Owl's Wisdom? Nope, that's not it.
-MARISHA-
No, I think Cat's--
-LIAM-
Meow.
-SAM-
Cat's Grace? Nope, that's dexterity.
-MARISHA-
Which one do I think it is?
-SAM-
Eagle's Splendor? Eagle's Splendor!
-MARISHA-
Splendor! That's right.
-SAM-
Charisma checks.
You get advantage on all charisma.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
How about Guidance? Anybody? Guidance?
-TRAVIS-
I get advantage?
-SAM-
Advantage on like--
-MATT-
The ship--
-SAM-
-- deception and persuasion.
-MATT-
-- curves--
-LAURA-
Yeah, they'll like you.
-MATT-
-- along the--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
-- outskirts of the cove that you're at, the beach-- [wooden clattering]
-- with the rocks.
-LAURA-
Ah!
-ASHLEY-
Get Laudna out there, too.
[wooden clattering]
-LIAM-
Cursed episode.
-MMARISHA-
I'll stand next to Chetney and take my ball gown and kind of like--
-ASHLEY-
Fix it!
-LAURA-
I know! It's bugging-- You have to fix it.
-MARISHA-
-- hike it up.
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Putting it out?
-MARISHA-
Yes. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Putting out the vibe?
-ASHLEY-
<i>Matthew!</i> (laughter)
-MATT-
It's fine.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
(shudders)
-LAURA-
No, no!
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
It's going to ruin her.
-MATT-
I'll fix it.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Yes!
-LAURA-
You're terrible.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, it's because it's not--
-LIAM-
It's not straight!
-TALIESIN-
Ah!
-TRAVIS-
Ah!
-LIAM-
I guess that's right.
-MATT-
The ship stops, and you can see mist pouring off the deck and into the water below to meet the mist that has been apparating from the space where you placed the compass.
Immediately, about six of the shadowed shapes sploosh into the water.
-MARISHA-
Oh, they can swim!
-SAM-
Do they make a splash?
-MATT-
And they vanish beneath the waves.
-MARISHA-
They're ghosts who can swim!
-MATT-
Four more (splashing).
-SAM-
They all sink and drown.
-TALIESIN-
The word you're looking for is--
-TRAVIS-
We can't swim!
-TALIESIN-
We're going to be parleying.
We're going to be talking.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
This is going to be a negotiation.
-LAURA-
I'm going to cast Mage Armor on myself, just in case.
-TALIESIN-
Don't start shit.
-MARISHA-
I floof up my hair.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Get the girls out.
-MATT-
The water begins to break about 30 or so feet from where you are on the beach.
-ASHLEY-
Fruit Roll-Up.
-MATT-
The water breaches, and you can see figures walking through the waves.
-TRAVIS-
Dope.
-SAM-
Cool, cool.
-MATT-
The rotted remnants of long-missing skin and flesh now left in thin lines across what is mainly skeletal figures wearing bits of torn leather armor and holding cutlasses and daggers at their sides as they emerge from the water.
(splashing)
-LIAM-
What the fuck?
-MATT-
Four, six, ten of them, all marching up the shore towards you.
-SAM-
Are they splashing the water, or they're just cutting through the water?
-MATT-
No, the water is splashing.
They are physical, skeletal creatures.
-SAM-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Splishes and splashes.
-TALIESIN-
Do any of them have a head wound?
-MATT-
You can see one of them that looks like it has a part of it was shot with probably a bolt of some kind.
-TALIESIN-
Are any of them nicely dressed or anything?
-MATT-
They all look pretty ragged.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that's fair.
-LAURA-
It was a bolt, though.
-MATT-
You can see there are a few other handful of figures that are still on the ship back there.
As they approach at a decent march, weapons out.
The thick, briny waters spilling through the ribs that are exposed now to the open jaws, draining out of the empty cavities in the skull as they approach.
This raspy voice echoes out from the ship beyond.
"Take it from them.
Leave them bleeding.
Whatever they have is ours."
-SAM-
We hid it, right?
-MATT-
I need you to roll initiative.
(screaming)
-SAM-
This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis! Join forces with the Mighty Nein!
-TRAVIS-
Not what I was expecting!
-LAURA-
We didn't even parley!
-LIAM-
What happened to the parley?
-TALIESIN-
You didn't decide to say anything--
-LIAM-
Just take their haunted shit.
-SAM-
Join forces with the Mighty Nein and take on the terrifying Uk'otoa.
-ALL-
(whispering) Uk'otoa.
-SAM-
Pre-order this behemoth today.
Expand your collection of CR miniatures at wizkids.io.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-SAM-
Wizkids.io/crminis or your local game store.
WizKids Combat Cam, everybody.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, we're going to beach them off so hard.
-SAM-
Hey, look, we're back in Dalen's Closet.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
It's very picturesque here.
I was picturing the coast of Seattle or something.
-TALIESIN-
What?
-SAM-
A little more gloomy.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, what?
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh.
-LIAM-
Yeah!
-TRAVIS-
Come on, Matt, come on.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's huge.
Cool! Look at the anchor.
-LIAM-
Level up to the WizKids boat.
-TRAVIS-
The anchor's like a clawed foot.
-LAURA-
That is a cool anchor.
-TRAVIS-
A clawed foot!
-LAURA-
Yes!
-TRAVIS-
It's so rad!
-LAURA-
Bring that fog in here! [fog machine beeps]
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
Beep.
-LIAM-
Yeah, here comes the Seattle now.
-SAM-
Thank you. I need it.
-TALIESIN-
Well.
-MATT-
So where are you amongst this beach at the moment?
-TALIESIN-
We were a bit back.
I mean, yeah.
-MARISHA-
I'll be standing next to Chet.
-TRAVIS-
About right here.
-MATT-
Okay, so you would've been here.
Chetney will be here.
-MARISHA-
This is going to be great.
-TALIESIN-
Where would've the big hole have been?
-MATT-
The hole would've been up here, would be closest you would've had.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
I would've been probably a couple-- I would've been a couple layers down there.
Probably on that one with the little three rock--
-MATT-
Like right there?
-TALIESIN-
No, the other way.
-MATT-
Here?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I will be next to the little stack of rocks.
-MARISHA-
Make friendsies.
-MATT-
All right, stack of rocks over here.
Like that?
-LAURA-
Sorry, closer in.
-MATT-
There?
-LAURA-
Do do do do.
It looks like a little stack of rocks from-- Yeah!
-MATT-
Oh, I see. Okay.
Put you there. FCG?
-SAM-
Oh, left of Chetney 10 feet.
-MATT-
10 feet there.
-SAM-
Great.
-MATT-
Orym?
-LIAM-
Orym will stick with Fearne wherever she goes right now.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, maybe we should, so we're not all-- Yeah. Maybe over here?
-MATT-
Over here?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
In the front or the back?
-ASHLEY-
Maybe in the back.
-LIAM-
Like over here?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Like in this area.
-MATT-
Over here?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
How do we feel about that?
-LIAM-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Orym's there.
Mister out?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Why not?
-LIAM-
Oh, boy.
-MATT-
Mister there.
-MARISHA-
Man, what do we do?
-SAM-
Well, they're attacking us, so--
-LAURA-
We probably attack them back.
-ALL-
Oh!
-LIAM-
It's a lot of them.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
That's a--
-LAURA-
Oh.
-LIAM-
Oh, look at that gnarly one.
-TALIESIN-
You have a bunch of--
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Just reminding FCG.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Yep, yep.
I had a funny feeling.
-SAM-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
I knew it.
-LAURA-
Oh.
That's cute.
-TALIESIN-
It's actually got a, yeah.
-MARISHA-
It's wet.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
What is it?
-ASHLEY-
It's poop.
-MARISHA-
Feel it.
-MATT-
That's horrifying.
-LIAM-
Is it like kid slime?
-SAM-
It's poop.
-LIAM-
You're poop.
-MATT-
All righty, so with that, 25 to 20.
-LIAM-
21.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, wait, shit, sorry.
I'm also 21.
-TRAVIS-
Higher dex.
-MARISHA-
Or Rollies.
-MATT-
It's Orym. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
These things are clearly advancing menacingly? That's the deal here?
-TALIESIN-
They sort of--
-MATT-
Ghost pirates don't show up to parley for the item that got taken from them.
They take it.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
It's fine.
We got a ghost ship.
-SAM-
You've got advanced--
-MATT-
20 to 15.
-MARISHA-
16.
-TRAVIS-
15.
No, 17. Sorry, so Chet, Laudna.
-TALIESIN-
Also, you have Turn Undead and stuff, too, so.
-MATT-
Okay.
15 to 10?
-TALIESIN-
You're third?
-TRAVIS-
17.
So Orym, Ashton, Chet.
-LAURA-
10.
-MATT-
All right, so 10 is Imogen.
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Where's FCG?
-SAM-
I'm at six.
-TRAVIS-
Fearne?
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Five.
Taking up the rear.
-MATT-
All righty.
So with that, top of this is Orym.
As they are marching forward weapons out.
(snarling)
-LIAM-
Okay, right off the bat, I'm going to scooch under Fearne's legs and switch her here.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
And say: You're going to light them up, right? I am going to give you an additional five to your AC, as long as you're close.
You don't have to stay close, but you have it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'll stay close.
-LIAM-
Then I'll go to there.
-ASHLEY-
Thanks.
-LIAM-
I'll actually go and then I'll step in front of her further.
Actually, going to scooch out real fast next to FCG.
Then I'm going to slice the air towards the one in the lead and test them out.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
So this big tall one in the front.
Yeah, I'll cut through the fog, hopefully. Natural 20.
-SAM-
Nice.
-LIAM-
The second one will be a 15.
-MATT-
All right, both of those hit.
-LIAM-
Okay, so the first one--
-TALIESIN-
I'll be chilling with these ones there.
Obviously, not the main course.
-LIAM-
Yeah, not the main course.
So just 12 for that because I'm not going to juice it up, and then the second one--
-SAM-
♪ Juice it up ♪
-LIAM-
-- is a 10.
So again, just a little exploratory slash at it.
As soon as I cut the air like that, I'll hop right back in front of Fearne.
-MATT-
Okay, so (slicing) and you duck back.
The slices hit. (slicing) You see bones crack and break.
One of the arms falls to the side for a bit, but holds on by a tether of some sort of leather strap and it continues to (disjointed shuffling) forward.
-LIAM-
Okay.
So not super slow or anything, just-- Cool, got it.
-MATT-
Yeah.
It looks like it took some heavy damage.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
It's holding on by a thread.
-LIAM-
Okay.
Next!
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
All right, finishing Orym's go. Ashton, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
What does 40 feet look like straight into the fray, out of curiosity.
-MATT-
40 feet?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
20 guys all in a row.
-MATT-
40 will get you about there.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, can I get into melee with that one?
-MATT-
With that one, you can.
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'm going to get into melee with that one and let's see what we got going! I'm going to rage.
And, ooh, interesting.
-LAURA-
It's so annoying.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Because you can do so much damage, but--
-TALIESIN-
This will be a lot of fun.
Well, I suddenly go a little translucent.
So this is going to be fun.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh!
-TALIESIN-
There's a hole in my head that goes straight through.
-SAM-
There's a hole in my head.
-TALIESIN-
Let's see.
All right, I'm going to take-- I'm going to take a standard swing at this guy.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
27 to hit.
-SAM-
Nice.
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
Here we go.
-SAM-
Come on, Ash.
-LIAM-
Get the AoE out.
-TALIESIN-
17 points of damage.
-MATT-
17 points damage on that first hit.
Crack! (raspy groan) It looks like it was a heavy hit and it's looking pretty hurt already in one strike.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to hit it again!
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
What am I doing?
-TALIESIN-
15 to hit?
-MATT-
15 just hits.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, 15.
Now we know.
Cool beans.
That's-- Oh wow, that landed. Well, okay.
-SAM-
Oh, keep going.
-TALIESIN-
22 points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Dang.
-SAM-
Nice!
-MATT-
(annihilating crash) Just smashes it onto the ground.
The rib cage breaks open.
The arm wounds filter out.
The weapon skitters a bit to the side.
It is lying there in the still wet, mushy bit of the sand, just unmoving.
-TALIESIN-
Is is that considered a creature kill?
-MATT-
That would be, technically.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I fall into the water, straight down.
-SAM-
What?
-MATT-
(splash)
-TALIESIN-
I show up right between FCG and--
-SAM-
Whoa, cool.
-MATT-
And Orym?
-TRAVIS-
Dang!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, right there.
I come, yeah, I drop back down.
-SAM-
Whoa!
-TALIESIN-
Next!
-LAURA-
Awesome.
-MATT-
All righty. That's great.
-ASHLEY-
Cool!
-SAM-
Amazing!
-LAURA-
Tight, tight, tight.
-ASHLEY-
(rapidly) Tight, tight, tight, tight.
-MATT-
"Don't stop until you take what's mine." At the 20 count, you watch as the water begins to swirl.
-LAURA-
Oh, no.
-MATT-
(soft shifting) In this direction.
It's like the beach front itself, a little bit of water there, is beginning to pour into this massive whirlpool.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Cool.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
We're not quite in the water, are we?
-MATT-
No. This figure over here on the edge of the ship leans forward with this high shrill screaming voice, "You heard the captain! Bring what he wants!" and pulls a moss-covered pistol, like a musket, and leans off to the side, a big blade at the side and--
-ASHLEY-
Mossberg.
-MATT-
(gunshot) -- is going to take a shot.
-TRAVIS-
Mossberg.
-MATT-
Right towards you, because you're right up front, the one who was last seen holding it.
Let's see.
You are beyond the 60-foot, so it'll be at disadvantage on the shot.
But with disadvantage, that'll be a 20 to hit?
-TRAVIS-
Hits.
-MATT-
All righty.
It'll make its second strike on you as well.
Second one will miss.
But you take, ooh! Nine points of cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
When you watch, when it fires (gunshot), the muzzle flash is blue flame. (explosion) As it impacts you, ice freezes up along the front of your chest before it cracks as you move your body.
-SAM-
Ouch.
-TRAVIS-
Damn.
-MATT-
Glance up in pain and look around at the surrounding, and you can now get a better look at a lot of these skeletons as they emerge with these dull, blue burning points of light in their skulls as they emerge.
As they step, you see the surface of the water seem to crack, like there's this blanket of freezing energy that's causing the water to slightly crystallize in their presence.
-TALIESIN-
Good to know.
-TRAVIS-
All right.
Damn.
-MATT-
That finishes their turn.
Chetney, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
Sheesh!
-SAM-
Come on, Chet.
-TRAVIS-
I'm stoked.
I will use-- Yeah, I'll use Minor Illusion to conjure a copy of the compass in my hand and I'll hold it up to the captain and I'll say: Call off your men! We know where your compass is! One of our party has gone to another island, but we need your ship to get us there.
Take us and we will help you retrieve your item!
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Oh, for fuck's sake.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-ASHLEY-
You also have Guidance.
-TRAVIS-
Advantage.
-ASHLEY-
I Guided you earlier.
-SAM-
You have advantage on it.
-TALIESIN-
Wow, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
What's guidance, a d4?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, d4.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Come on!
-TRAVIS-
(excited warbling)
-MARISHA-
(excited growls)
-TRAVIS-
13, 17.
18, 19, 20, 21.
-SAM-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
21.
-TALIESIN-
My god, the community theater worked.
-LAURA-
That's with advantage?
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
With advantage. The other one was a natural one.
-LAURA-
Yikes.
-SAM-
Did you roll a one or--
-MATT-
Natural 20.
(groaning)
-LAURA-
Come on!
-TRAVIS-
Plus stuff?
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
(deflating tone)
-MATT-
"That's fine! We'll find your friend.
But we don't leave survivors."
-TRAVIS-
They don't leave--
-LIAM-
(laugh)
-TALIESIN-
Well, that's--
-TRAVIS-
That's all right.
Your crew can stay here with us.
I'll-- (creaking joints) (howling) I'll use my Hybrid Transformation to go wolf mode.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TALIESIN-
You're hungry like the wolf.
You haven't had a sandwich.
-TRAVIS-
Because I'm not in melee, I will break over this way, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.
-MATT-
Right there. You got it.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Let's go, guys.
-MATT-
Laudna, you're up.
-LIAM-
Let's go casters.
-MARISHA-
All right.
Looking at their undead bony forms, I crack and dislocate a few of my bones and go into my Form of Dread.
-MATT-
(body tearing) Which looks like?
-MARISHA-
You know, it's a little halfway between, you know, my tree form and my widow form.
-MATT-
Okay, so a merger between the two of them.
-MARISHA-
Mirroring them a little bit, too.
Maybe I got some barnacles.
I don't know.
-MATT-
Cool.
-MARISHA-
Then I'm going to Fireball them.
-MATT-
Okay!
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-TALIESIN-
That's how it's done!
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-MATT-
Just right there?
-ASHLEY-
Boosh!
-MARISHA-
Yep!
-MATT-
You could-- Okay, yeah.
So all those right there? (projectile explosion)
-LIAM-
♪ It's AoE ♪
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll for--
-TALIESIN-
Well, okay.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll for damage on that one.
-TRAVIS-
Well, okay!
-MATT-
That's a fail.
Fail.
-LAURA-
♪ Ey oh ey ♪ (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
♪ Eh oh ey ♪
-MATT-
What's the DC?
-LIAM-
10 seconds later. Yep.
-MARISHA-
16.
-MATT-
Fail.
-LIAM-
That's my dumb joke.
-MATT-
Fail.
Fail.
-LAURA-
Yay.
-MATT-
Fail. Jesus, how many eights are they going to roll?
-LIAM-
So many eights, Matt.
-MATT-
Fail.
Success.
All right. So all of them failed except for that one tiny guy over there.
-TALIESIN-
Some Rosencrantz and Guildenstern shit right there.
-LIAM-
(sneering) Meh!
-LAURA-
They are going to die.
Destroy them.
-MARISHA-
26 fire damage.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
26 fire damage.
(one-by-one death thuds)
-SAM-
Oh my god!
-TRAVIS-
Yo!
-ASHLEY-
Let's go!
-MATT-
They all just, in this explosion--
-TRAVIS-
Calm the fuck down!
-MATT-
You watch the bones scatter out--
-SAM-
Whoa!
-MATT-
-- from the detonation.
(explosion) The mist is burned away in a minute before it all begins to roll back in to fill the space and they all crumble into piles of bone and armor under the waves as the ocean begins to almost drag them back out.
-TRAVIS-
We also do a "Point Break"-like shock wave, like-- (slow-mo, theatrical explosion) (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you see the water do that dip and then come back.
Yeah, a little mushroom? Then, I don't know, are they immune to fear?
-MATT-
They're all destroyed.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Didn't you say one--?
-MATT-
There is one, there is one. You're right.
-TRAVIS-
There's the little one.
-MARISHA-
He's afraid of me.
He's scared.
-MATT-
Nah. He's immune to frightened, sorry.
-MARISHA-
He's immune to fear.
That's what I thought.
Can I just as a--
-TALIESIN-
Oh no, I'm going to die.
-MARISHA-
Shout to the captain in Shadow Cant and say: Sure you don't want to make a deal?
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-ASHLEY-
Let's do it.
-LAURA-
Yaas!
-SAM-
Shadow Cant came in handy.
-MARISHA-
For once!
-ASHLEY-
Can I Guide her?
-MATT-
You got to touch somebody to Guide them and it's your action to do it.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
(laughs) But good for trying.
-TRAVIS-
It's your action to do it. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Now I know.
-MARISHA-
Natural 20! (cheering)
-MATT-
For a total of?
-MARISHA-
24.
-MATT-
24.
You now glance over and up here, you see the haggard- looking skeletal dwarf with this patchy, awful, mossy beard that hangs down, tucked into this breasted over long jacket.
This hat brim that's burning, cleft up top.
You can see his eyes are burning, these bright flaming blue balls that (whooshing) out from the front of the face.
You see him holding this massive saber up and this gnarled-looking hand cannon in the other hand.
Looks back and meets your gaze.
"Well, let's have a chat," and he puts his weapons away.
-SAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
"The rest, kill them."
-TRAVIS-
(groans) You can parley.
-MARISHA-
Stick. (laughs) All right.
-MATT-
Do you want to move? Or stay put?
-MARISHA-
I'll skitter towards that way.
I'll skitter that way.
-LAURA-
So did he say, "The rest, kill them"--
-LIAM-
Kill us.
-MATT-
30 is there.
-LAURA-
-- to us?
-MARISHA-
Go back one.
-LAURA-
About us?
-MARISHA-
Go back one.
-MATT-
There you go.
-SAM-
He only wants to talk to Laudna.
And I don't blame him!
-LAURA-
They're parleying, so I shouldn't attack him? Is that what we're saying?
-SAM-
They're going to attack us.
-TALIESIN-
I think we have a couple more to deal with.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your turn.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
They're going to get back up. They're not gone.
He did not take them away.
-MATT-
It is the captain's turn.
The captain is holding his action.
-SAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
He has his weapons away.
-SAM-
But he's doing it in a bitchy way.
-MATT-
He's essentially waiting on the ship and doing a slight pacing back and forth as he looks over in your direction and over the rest of the field.
He will, as a bonus action, do Command From the Grave.
So he commands one crew member within 120 feet.
This one here turns, goes into a full move.
30, up to you.
-SAM-
Oh no!
-MATT-
Hears the captain goes, after shouting, "The rest, kill them," the one looks over (groans), looks over just past you and goes into an unnatural sprint.
All of a sudden, this undead strength go through it.
Comes charging over the beach.
(snarling) Rushing up towards you and it's going to--
-LAURA-
Were you not close enough to attack?
-TRAVIS-
Attack of opportunity?
-MATT-
You were five feet away from it, so.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
10 feet, technically.
So it's going to take two attacks at you with its longsword.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
Imogen, no!
-MATT-
That's going to be 11.
-LAURA-
Miss!
-LIAM-
(gasps)
-MATT-
And a 15.
-LAURA-
Miss!
-SAM-
Imogen, yeah!
-LAURA-
It's the Mage Armor.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Your Mage Armor deflects it off to the side.
(snarls) Up in front of you right there.
That's going to finish the captain's turn.
Now it is Imogen's go.
-LAURA-
Ugh.
I wanted to do something so much cooler than just fucking kill one little skeleton.
-TALIESIN-
Well, I mean, that skeleton, anything could happen to that skeleton in the next round.
-TRAVIS-
Get on up!
-TALIESIN-
Just saying.
-SAM-
Get up!
-TRAVIS-
Hey Matt, just because I can't see it all, it looks like one person on the deck, one in a crow's nest, and the captain?
-MATT-
Correct.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
For now.
-SAM-
That we can see.
-MATT-
That you can see, yeah.
-SAM-
Could be more under in the hold.
-TRAVIS-
(old sailor voice) More hidden behind the sail is what you're telling me!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
(old sailor voice) There could be more down below decks.
-LAURA-
I know.
-MATT-
Whatcha thinking, Imogen?
-TRAVIS-
On the leeward side.
-SAM-
(laughs)
On the poop.
-LAURA-
What if he attacks Laudna before I can--
-TALIESIN-
Hmm, interesting.
-TRAVIS-
I love it when Taliesin says "interesting."
-LAURA-
I'm going to--
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit, never mind.
-TRAVIS-
Aw.
-LAURA-
The rocks on the ground around me are going to start shaking and they're going to float up and start spinning around my head again.
-LIAM-
♪ Rocks ♪
-MATT-
(whipping wind)
-TALIESIN-
♪ Ah ♪
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
And--
-TRAVIS-
♪ ("Flash") ♪
-TALIESIN-
Thank you for that.
-LAURA-
I'm going to bonus action push the skeleton away from me.
-MATT-
Okay.
Strength save, right?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
That is going to fail. Four.
-LAURA-
All right, and then when I do that, two of the meteors are going to slam into him.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-MATT-
All right, he gets a dex save for those?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Okay.
(laughs) Two saves? Against each one?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
First one's a fail.
Second one is also a fail.
A four and an eight.
-LAURA-
Okay, great.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
So that's 4d6 fire damage.
-MATT-
(meteors impacting)
-LAURA-
11, 13...
Was that a three? Let's go with that, it was was a three.
16 points of fire damage.
-MATT-
16 points of fire damage.
Bones splinter off.
You can see a portion of where its armor was collapses inward and the metal's dented from the impact and the flames burn up the side.
(snarls) It looks hurt, but it's still standing.
-LAURA-
(groans) Can I move back and get up onto the rock behind me?
-SAM-
Get up!
-MATT-
Yes, you can.
-LAURA-
How high can I get? Yeah.
-MATT-
You can get up there, probably.
-TRAVIS-
Does it look like it reacts any kind of way to the fire?
-MATT-
It gets hurt by it.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
It doesn't seem like it's resistant to it, if that's what you were trying to ask.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right, so that finishes your turn, Imogen?
-LAURA-
Yes, sir.
-MATT-
All righty.
So now, the one up here in the crow's nest.
-TRAVIS-
Somebody jump in the whirlpool! (laughs)
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Laudna seems to be walking right towards it.
-TRAVIS-
See what happens!
-MARISHA-
Well...
-MATT-
The one in the crow's nest, as you glance up, you can see it in shadow as it sits up a bit and leans into the edge.
This skeleton is blackened.
The actual bone itself is a soot color.
You can almost see veins of reddish light through it, like it's a molten skeleton in some way.
You can see it has this heavy sash over its shoulder and a partially armored breastplate that's only over one shoulder.
The skull sits in there, and you can see it has this long leather strap that seems to be embedded in the back of the skull.
It dangles down in front as it pulls up this massive heavy crossbow and aims in a sniper shot from above.
It's going to use its bonus action sniper to give itself advantage on the next attack, and it's going to--
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-MATT-
-- make two heavy crossbow strikes.
-TRAVIS-
Two?! These are never good.
-MATT-
Yeah.
One of them's going to be at FCG.
-SAM-
Bring it.
-MATT-
One of them's going to be at you.
-TRAVIS-
No!
-MATT-
This one at FCG has advantage on the strike.
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Damn! Second one!
-MATT-
That's crazy.
He didn't even need advantage on it. (laughs) Natural 20 and a natural 19 on an advantage on that shot.
I'm getting some good rolls.
Let's keep it going.
-SAM-
Nice, nice.
-MATT-
Then the one against you.
That's going to be a 22 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Hits.
-MATT-
All righty.
Some good rolls there.
-TALIESIN-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
All right, so against you, FCG.
-LIAM-
Or made up.
-SAM-
It's going to be rough.
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-LAURA-
I didn't even see the guy in the crow's nest.
-MATT-
Because it's a crit, however--
-SAM-
I will negate the crit by asking.
-MATT-
What?
-SAM-
I'm just going to ask you to negate the crit.
-MATT-
Oh. You can do that?
-SAM-
Yeah, I just am.
-TRAVIS-
He's asking you on a personal--
-ASHLEY-
As Sam?
-SAM-
As a personal favor.
-MATT-
Oh, no no.
No, that's not going to work. Sorry, no.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Be your best friend!
-MATT-
No.
(laughter)
That's going to be 18 piercing damage.
-LAURA-
Oh. No.
-SAM-
Doubled?
-MATT-
No, 18 piercing damage.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
And 36 cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god!
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-LIAM-
Frozen robot.
-MATT-
As the crossbow releases--
-SAM-
54!
-MATT-
-- this burst of blueish magical energy scatters off of it, and you--
-TRAVIS-
54?
-SAM-
54?
-MATT-
When the heavy bolt hits FCG, it almost pushes you back five feet and you're almost pinned into the beach itself for a second as you have to (straining)--
-LAURA-
Oh my god!
-MATT-
-- get yourself back up onto your wheel, and it is through your torso, poking out the back.
-SAM-
Oh no, it pierced my metal! Oh schnack!
-TALIESIN-
How bad are you?
-TRAVIS-
34 and 18?
-SAM-
I'm okay. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Liar.
-MATT-
All righty.
That finishes their go.
-SAM-
It hit you, or it missed you?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, you didn't roll damage on me.
-MATT-
That's right, and then--
-TRAVIS-
I mean, yes you did.
Don't worry about it, keep going.
-MATT-
That's cool.
(laughter)
You take 11 points of piercing damage reduced to five because of your form--
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying to get that guy--
-MATT-
-- and five points of cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Which I take all of.
-TALIESIN-
Can I?
-MATT-
Yes, you do.
Finishing their go.
-SAM-
Woof.
-MATT-
It now goes to the crew members' turn.
-SAM-
But they're dead!
-MATT-
All the water (splashing) as the crew members' pieces reattach, and they all get right back up out of the water.
-SAM-
Oh no!
-TRAVIS-
(groans)
-TALIESIN-
That's what you need to deal with.
-TRAVIS-
I got to become the captain.
-MARISHA-
You got to do that thing, he won't die.
-TRAVIS-
You got to talk?
-MARISHA-
You have to talk to him.
-SAM-
(rapping) You gotta get a got, gotta get a got--
-TRAVIS-
Or we got to reach in and pull his gonads out of his body?
-MATT-
They can only move half speed.
-TRAVIS-
And then [inaudible].
-SAM-
Is it their--
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Is it their action to reform?
-TRAVIS-
Get a little pirate jaw.
-MATT-
Nope.
At the start of their turn, they regain hit points.
-SAM-
Oh shit.
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
-LIAM-
Shite.
-ASHLEY-
Shit!
-MARISHA-
Do they regain all their hit points?
-TRAVIS-
It's got to be worth taking that shit.
-TALIESIN-
When do you go again?
-SAM-
Huh? It's my turn next.
-LAURA-
Yeah, there's got to be a way to steer the ship.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, well then, yeah.
-SAM-
I know, I've just got to get there.
-TRAVIS-
Get the wheel!
-LAURA-
Yeah, charm him.
-TRAVIS-
Then say: Jesus!
-MATT-
This one's going to dash with its action.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Take the wheel ♪
-MATT-
To just scoot past.
It is going to go past you, Laudna.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
It ignores you, but it remains in combat with you.
Actually, this one's going to keep going up to here.
-ASHLEY-
Shit, shit, shit.
-MATT-
You do get an opportunity attack, if you want to, against the one that goes by.
-MARISHA-
Melee?
-MATT-
If you want to take it.
-MARISHA-
I just punch him?
-LAURA-
You haven't gone yet.
-MATT-
You can if you want to.
-LIAM-
I went first.
-MARISHA-
I have negative strength.
-SAM-
Punch a ghost!
-TRAVIS-
Do it! Who knows what's going to happen?
-SAM-
Punch a ghost!
-MATT-
What could possibly happen in the middle of a parley with a ghost captain?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's the thing, I don't want to-- No.
-MATT-
Then don't. Okay.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
The question was there.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
You're going to bait me into this.
-LAURA-
FCG hasn't gone yet.
-SAM-
I'm about to.
-TRAVIS-
Should we threaten the cursed item?
-MATT-
Those two can't strike.
-TRAVIS-
Should we threaten the compass?
-LAURA-
No, Laudna's right--
-MATT-
They're swarming in here.
-TRAVIS-
Threaten to destroy it?
-TALIESIN-
This is going to, if--
-ASHLEY-
Uh!
-TALIESIN-
This is going to do it.
-MATT-
This one, which can go, is going to rush up to you.
-MARISHA-
Are you a werewolf again?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
This one's going to one, two, three, and it's going to dash up to here as well.
-SAM-
Why, does she mean something to you?
-MATT-
This one's going to run up to the top of the mountain after you, Imogen.
-LAURA-
Me?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Me?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Why, though?
Sweet little me?
-MATT-
That's going to be, two of them are going to attack you twice.
The other two are going to attack you twice.
-TALIESIN-
Awesome.
-MATT-
Rushing up with unnatural speed, slashing at you twice, FCG.
That's going to be 20 to hit.
-SAM-
Hits.
-MATT-
Other one is a natural one.
-LAURA-
Ha ha!
-SAM-
Misses!
-MATT-
All right, so that one is going to be--
-TRAVIS-
Oh man! (screams)
-MATT-
Over here.
Eight points of slashing damage and one cold.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
The other one's attacking you twice.
Natural one.
And a natural 20. Wow, getting it back to back.
-TALIESIN-
God fucking damn it.
-ASHLEY-
Jeez!
-MATT-
So that will be--
-LAURA-
He's going.
I go after all these.
-ASHLEY-
So many 20s!
-TRAVIS-
Stop it, Matt. Stop.
-MATT-
14 points of slashing damage and six points of cold damage.
-SAM-
Ow!
-MATT-
Then four against you.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
That'll be 15 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
Misses.
-MATT-
14 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
(whooshes)
-MATT-
23 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-MATT-
And a 19 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
And that hits.
-MATT-
Okay, so for that, you take six points of slashing damage, reduced to three, and two points of cold.
-TALIESIN-
So that's five.
-MATT-
Five, and then that is going to be 10 points of slashing damage reduced to five and five points of cold.
-TALIESIN-
15 points of damage.
-MATT-
There you go.
That finishes their go over there.
The two that are on you are going to roll for twice, each of them.
Actually, only one of them can, so it's going to be 17 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Misses.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 24 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Definitely hits.
-MATT-
That will be nine points of slashing damage and three points of cold, so four--
-TRAVIS-
Seven?
-MATT-
Seven, and the one that rushed up to you, Imogen, two strikes on you.
That's going to be 14 to hit.
And 12 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Payback for those 20s.
-MATT-
The same one, it's climbing up the hill like (snarls) and striking out, and as you dart backward, your Mage Armor is flashing in places as it deflects the blade in its claws as it swipes out at you.
It's clambering up the hill on the rock after you and can't seem to get hold, yet.
Finishing their go, now it is FCG, with Fearne on deck.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
All right.
Surrounded and harried by undead, I assume, creatures, I will take my coin and flip it up into the air above us and mutter a quick prayer.
Changebringer, no offense to Laudna, but can you please shine your light and wipe these evil dead souls off the face of this flat planet? I will cast Turn Undead/Destroy Undead.
-MATT-
Okay, all right, so what's the DC on this?
-SAM-
It is a 15.
-MATT-
15. Starting over here, it's 30 feet, right?
-SAM-
30 feet.
-MATT-
Yeah, so over here.
That is a success.
Wait, hold on.
No, they have no wisdom bonus.
That is actually just a fail.
So he is turned. That one--
-SAM-
Or destroyed.
-MATT-
-- also fail.
What's the--? They are CR2, technically.
-SAM-
Oh. Well, then they're just turned.
-MATT-
They're just turned.
They're just getting turnt.
All right, that guy there.
-SAM-
Because wait, what level are we? We're 10.
-MATT-
That's a fail.
-TRAVIS-
We're 10.
-SAM-
Yeah, so it's one or lower.
-MATT-
Next one, that's a two. Turn.
One behind Laudna. Man, now they're rolling shit.
-SAM-
Good.
-LAURA-
Good!
-MATT-
Turn.
-TRAVIS-
Just looking for a ride!
-MATT-
The one next to Orym. Natural seven, turn.
-MARISHA-
Do I have to roll again?
-MATT-
Yes, you do.
Man, all of them fail.
-TRAVIS-
Affects you, too?
-MATT-
They are all currently afraid of you.
-SAM-
"A turned creature spends its turn trying to move farther away from you.
It can't willingly move to the space--"
-MARISHA-
Balance.
-MATT-
What's up?
-MARISHA-
I rolled a natural one.
-MATT-
A natural one.
You are also afraid.
-TRAVIS-
Of FCG.
-MARISHA-
Well, I'm immune to fear.
-MATT-
So then don't even worry about it.
-TALIESIN-
It just feels weird.
-LAURA-
Aren't they immune to fear? Wait, how does that work?
-SAM-
It's not fear.
-LAURA-
It's Turn Undead.
-SAM-
It's turned; it's not fear.
-MATT-
That's right.
So then it wouldn't-- So Turn Undead here.
Yeah, it must spend its turns trying to move as far away as it can.
-TALIESIN-
What can cancel that?
-MATT-
So it's technically not fear.
-TALIESIN-
How do you undo-- If you attack a creature that has been turned, do they have to stop turning, or do they keep turning?
-SAM-
There's nothing they can do.
-MATT-
It's one minute, or until it takes any damage.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, until it takes any damage.
-LAURA-
You just have to move away from him.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
"Try to move as far away from me as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
It also can't take reactions.
For its action, it can only use the dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the dodge action." So you have to run into the ocean, basically.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Okay. That's what I was doing, anyway.
-TRAVIS-
And into the hands of Captain Novos, backwards: Sovon.
-MARISHA-
Sovon!
-SAM-
Shit. Well--
-MATT-
So even the terrifying divine presence of the Changebringer washes through your undead spirit, and you feel this icy grip in your body that--
-SAM-
What can I do?
-MATT-
-- perhaps you are anathema to the gods, and their presence means that you are also pinned for destruction.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
You feel this urge to get the hell away from whatever's behind you as fast as you can.
-MARISHA-
Ugh! Gods hate me!
-MATT-
So that's your action.
-SAM-
That is my action.
I'm trying to see, does anything undo Turn Undead?
-MATT-
One minute, or until they take damage.
-SAM-
But there's no Remove Curse, no Greater Restoration, Dispel Magic?
-MATT-
This is one of the drawbacks, one of the few situational drawbacks, of the Hollow One.
-TALIESIN-
I got it.
-SAM-
Okay.
They can't take reactions, so I'm going to use my movement to scoot back five feet.
-MATT-
All righty.
-SAM-
That's kind of all I can do.
Oh, maybe as a bonus action, I'll sip this here health potion.
Will you let me do that for a bonus action?
-MATT-
I'll allow it, sure.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
It's in your hand.
-SAM-
Five points.
-MATT-
Plus two.
-SAM-
Seven points.
-MATT-
All right, pass that back over here.
All righty.
So finishing FCG's go, that brings us to Fearne, with Orym on deck.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so this is a little different.
So they cannot attack us at this point.
-TALIESIN-
No. In fact, if we attack them, that's a problem.
-ASHLEY-
If we attack them, they come back to us.
Okay, so what I'm going to do, that changes things a bit.
-MATT-
There are three over here that were unaffected, and those on the ship that were unaffected.
-LAURA-
Yeah, the ones on the ship are really powerful.
-MARISHA-
Can you take me with you to the ship?
-TRAVIS-
(cooing) To the whirlpool!
-TALIESIN-
That creates a problem for me, but okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
We could incapacitate Laudna.
-LAURA-
No, no!
-SAM-
Otherwise she's just going to keep running into the ocean.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so--
-TALIESIN-
We just have to tap her.
You just have to tap her.
-MARISHA-
It's fine.
-SAM-
You're going to get to the boat in one turn.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, where is Laudna?
-SAM-
What about for the rest of the minute? You're going to jump over the edge of the boat and keep going.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to have a lovely conversation!
-SAM-
You <i>have</i> to keep moving.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I have to keep moving?
-SAM-
Yes! You will be running into the ocean forever.
-MARISHA-
Unless Fearne, unless someone smacks me?
-LAURA-
For a minute.
It's not that long.
-TRAVIS-
Or up and over through the boat.
-TALIESIN-
There's a lot of people who could smack you before your turn, it's okay.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Can I just dash back and forth?
-MATT-
No, it has to be as far away from him as possible.
I'm letting you game this enough as it is, so.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you hear that?
-MARISHA-
Game it enough?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that's right!
-MARISHA-
What are you talking about? What am I trying to game at all?
-MATT-
No, not you.
-SAM-
Me!
-TALIESIN-
Everyone.
-MATT-
People who are--
-TRAVIS-
How basic.
-MATT-
-- understanding the--
-MARISHA-
Once again, what the fuck did I do?
-MATT-
-- specifics of Turn Undead.
-TRAVIS-
You died.
-MATT-
Fearne?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I am going to cast Fire Shield on myself.
-SAM-
Nice.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
So you see wispy flames are wreathing around my body, and it's a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10, and I'm doing a warm shield instead of a cold shield, so I have resistance to cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to-- Hang on, let me check something real quick.
All right, I'm going to start running to Laudna.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Technically, run over Orym, because Orym can fit under her.
-MATT-
Now, in order to get to her, because this area is currently all blocked by skeletons, you could try and leap over them, if you want to try.
-LAURA-
It's only a minute.
-ASHLEY-
Sure, maybe I'll try a little Mirthful Leap situation.
-MATT-
Make a strength check for me.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
It's a DC 10 on this just to try.
Because you have the Mirthful Leap ability, I'll say it's a DC 10.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
We'll say an athletics check.
-ASHLEY-
Athletics check? Okay.
-MATT-
Just-- (grunts)
-ASHLEY-
Oh, dang it! It's a nine!
-MATT-
Nine?
-ASHLEY-
Nine!
-TRAVIS-
<i>Nein!</i>
-MATT-
So you rush up, leap, and just, you end up kicking off one of the legs and you land there.
They're blocking your way as they're all turning around.
-ASHLEY-
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! Okay.
Okay, so I took the action of that.
Is there any way I can try to move a little bit more?
-MATT-
Not through them, unfortunately.
You can move five feet this way.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
They blocked the path there with their swarm.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-SAM-
That's what I'm saying.
You can incapacitate her.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to hang out there.
I'm going to hang out there and I'm going to have Mister start making his way to Laudna.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Makin' his way ♪
-MATT-
All right.
(little hoots)
-ASHLEY-
And--
-SAM-
(heavy thump) (laughter)
-MARISHA-
That's what you get, you cleric bitch!
-ASHLEY-
That's what you get! (laughter)
-MATT-
Oh, buddy.
-LIAM-
2d6 cold damage.
-MATT-
What's Mister doing?
-LIAM-
To the elbow.
-TRAVIS-
Such a big swing!
-ASHLEY-
Okay, Mister-- I could--
-LAURA-
(laughs) Are you okay?
-ASHLEY-
I could Dimension Door Laudna.
I could Dimension Door you, Laudna, with Mister.
-MATT-
You mean the Flame Teleport?
-ASHLEY-
Flame Teleport.
But that will only be a little bit.
-LAURA-
But she'll keep running from where she is.
-LIAM-
Dimension Door.
-LAURA-
She's going to keep running.
-ASHLEY-
Shit!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, she's going to--
-ASHLEY-
Okay, all right.
So Mister's going to try to go forward--
-TRAVIS-
Not if you drop her in the whirlpool.
-ASHLEY-
-- and shoot some flame seeds at the Captain.
-SAM-
That's true.
-MATT-
At the Captain?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I don't know if he--
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
-- can reach.
-MATT-
What's the distance on it?
-ASHLEY-
I can't see--
-TRAVIS-
You don't need to breathe, right?
-ASHLEY-
It is--
-MARISHA-
I breathe.
-ASHLEY-
It is--
-MARISHA-
Slowly, very slowly.
(laughs)
-LIAM-
One breath.
One breath a day.
-ASHLEY-
60 feet.
-MATT-
60 feet.
As he throws his flame seed (flames whooshing), it arcs (splashing) into the ocean water just below deck.
-ASHLEY-
All right. All right, all right.
-SAM-
Incoming cannon fire, sire.
-ASHLEY-
Where is Mister?
-MATT-
Mister's over right here, next to Laudna.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Shit. Okay.
All right, that's all I can do.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to fuck the whole thing up.
-ASHLEY-
That's my turn.
-SAM-
I know, I thought it was going to just to hurt you or something.
-ASHLEY-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
That's your turn. All right, finishing up Fearne's go.
Orym, you're up. Ashton, you're on deck.
-LIAM-
Okay, total chaos everywhere.
There's way more powerful people here and problem on the boat.
So Orym looks at all the tall people and legs and skeletons and he's going to chance it and he's going to run under Fearne, under this feller here, towards the water.
-MATT-
All right.
So five, 10, 15.
-LIAM-
I will leap that way, which I can go the full 15, the rest of my distance with the boots.
So that's my movement.
And I'll use my action.
Am I on foot still, or am I swimming, at this point?
-MATT-
You are about knees deep in the water, so it's difficult terrain from this point forward.
-LIAM-
Okay.
I'm going to wade in.
So that'll get me five, 10, 15.
-MATT-
(splashes) The water is <i>freezing cold</i>.
It is very, very cold.
-MARISHA-
I want to go talk to this guy.
-LAURA-
Yeah, but you can't--
-TRAVIS-
Crazy. Okay.
I was like, what? It looks so beautiful.
-MARISHA-
Can you convincingly grab--
-LIAM-
Action Surge.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go!
-LIAM-
Use the bonus action to swing out Seedling and send a vine to the side of the ship, hopefully over that ladder.
-ASHLEY-
Cool.
-MATT-
Okay.
Okay.
-LIAM-
And (zooms).
-MATT-
Pull yourself forward.
-LIAM-
Pull myself to the edge of the ship.
So that's a bonus action.
-MATT-
Up to the side there.
-LIAM-
Oh, I'm down below? Okay.
-MATT-
Oh, you want to get up to the very edge?
-LIAM-
I was hoping to, yeah.
-MATT-
What's the range on that?
-LIAM-
It's 30 feet.
-MATT-
30 feet?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, you could definitely get that.
-MARISHA-
You don't read your damn spells?
-LIAM-
Zhoop. And that was the bonus action.
-MATT-
And you are now up onto the ship and you are next to the one that was shouting the very loud, high-pitched shrilly voice.
You could see a human skeleton, female with a wild bush of black, curly hair that emanates from this bleached skull.
After you attach and land on the side of the ship, the skull (crackles), Just grinning at you with its blue eyes flickering flame.
-LIAM-
Okay.
Shoot.
I bolt. I'm going to start running this way.
Five, 10, 15.
Up, 20, 25, 30.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, let's go!
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Are you going to attack him?
-LIAM-
No.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
And then I will use my action to--
-MATT-
Well, you've already used-- So you Action Surged.
-LIAM-
I Action Surged.
-MATT-
Which gives you an action, which you just used to dash.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
There's no movement attached to it?
-LIAM-
Oh, it's not a whole other.
-MATT-
No.
-LIAM-
Oh, okay. Wait, rewind then.
-MATT-
No, it's just--
-SAM-
(VHS tape rewinding)
-MATT-
Yeah, it's not a whole different turn.
-LIAM-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not a whole different turn.
You're right.
-TRAVIS-
From where he is, can Orym tell who the Captain is, at this point? We don't think it's the guy on the deck, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah, no, we spotted him.
He was the--
-MATT-
He's the one who's been shouting orders from that point.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, okay.
-MATT-
Yeah.
And this one over here shouted, speaking about the Captain in the third person.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Did everybody get that?
-LIAM-
(sighs)
-TRAVIS-
Man overboard!
-LIAM-
I might as well.
I'm not in the right-- Up to 15.
I'm not in the right position.
Do I have any more movement? Could I get one more square that way? Or am I out? Am I tapped?
-MATT-
Let's see.
Five, 10.
-SAM-
Well, you fucked up.
-LIAM-
Five.
-MATT-
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
-SAM-
I fucked up.
-MATT-
35 was your movement?
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
It was 30.
-MATT-
Just 30. So it was there.
-LIAM-
That was movement. Then action to do another 15.
-MATT-
Well, then you--
-TRAVIS-
You did the leap, right?
-MATT-
The leap, right? Which is 15 feet?
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's all part of my movement.
-MATT-
Right. So that's all your movement.
-TALIESIN-
So it's going to be the question of whether or not I know that, sorry.
-MATT-
So it's movement and then it was an action to do the--
-SAM-
Do what you do.
-LIAM-
I thought I got only yay far and then I needed to use my action to get even further.
That was to get me within reach of using the vine.
-MATT-
30, right.
And so then you moved over here for that.
-LIAM-
Yeah, and that ended the whole turn.
So the next--
-MATT-
Correct, so the Action Surge would get you right there.
-LIAM-
Okay, so that's as far as I go.
All right.
Then I will just lay in.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, let's go!
-LAURA-
Yes!
-LIAM-
And a one, which I'll reroll.
For 17.
-MATT-
17 hits.
-LIAM-
Okay, let's make it-- Do they have any weapon in hand?
-MATT-
They do, they have a shortsword in one hand and a pistol in the other.
-LIAM-
Pistol in the other. Okay.
I will make the first a goading attack.
So that's a four, eight, a six, 14 plus the-- Total of 22 for the first hit.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
And they have to beat wisdom 17.
-MATT-
Goading attack?
-LIAM-
Goading him.
-MATT-
That's 15.
-LIAM-
So fail.
And then I'll do disarm attack and try to knock their gun into the water.
-MATT-
You got it.
-LIAM-
So that's-- Disarming is strength.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
Two and six is eight plus-- 17 for the second hit.
-MATT-
21 on the strength.
Natural 19.
-LIAM-
Okay, so they held onto their gun, they took 17 more points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-MATT-
So both strikes heavy hits him.
You hit the pistol and it knocks it out of their grip and they catch it again in the air.
The skeleton, still looking down at you, looks back up past you, over the top and goes, "Captain, looks like we've got boarded by a flea!"
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
He called you a flea.
-LIAM-
I call me a flea.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
That finish your turn?
-LIAM-
Yeah, sorry for the lag.
I confused my economy.
-MATT-
Ashton, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
A play.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
Question. I know I've seen this spell before.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Did Laudna also do the shift the way the rest of the skeletons did?
-MATT-
She was already moving this direction.
You watch them all turn around.
Make a perception check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MATT-
Or actually, no. Insight.
Make an insight check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Come on, baby.
16.
-MATT-
16? You notice them in the (splashes) wave.
And you watched it affect Laudna once before.
All the skeletons (cracks) turn around and right as Laudna goes, and goes into a skittering run that's different than her normal skittering run.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Well, shit.
Okay, I'm going to-- I'm going to gently push through these.
I'm going to scooch through these guys straight ahead of me.
-MATT-
How?
-TALIESIN-
Can I just push through?
-MATT-
Unfortunately, you cannot.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MATT-
You have to find a way to shove them or move around them.
-TALIESIN-
All right, let's go.
-SAM-
Could you turn into water again?
-MARISHA-
Can you get me to the ship?
-TALIESIN-
Let's see.
I can't see, hold on.
-MARISHA-
Is there anything else we can offer this guy?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, either offer him the compass, threaten the compass, or--
-TALIESIN-
If I can go around, I'll do a little hop off that rock to try and--
-MATT-
Here?
-TALIESIN-
Not all the way up.
I'm going to try and parkour my way around.
-MATT-
Five, 10, 15, 20.
25, 30, 35.
-TALIESIN-
And then drop down.
Jump down.
-LAURA-
Parkour!
-MATT-
There we go.
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
And I'm going to-- I'm going to-- Straight palm to the back of the head.
Just pop.
-MARISHA-
Oh Jesus.
-MATT-
Okay, roll.
Roll with your strength and proficiency bonus.
-TALIESIN-
Well, actually, I have an unarmed strike.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Can I reel in how much damage I do, or is it just the amount of damage I do?
-MATT-
It's just the amount of damage you do.
-TALIESIN-
Cool beans.
-MATT-
You're raging.
So I'll say yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, no, no.
That's--
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
18 to hit?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
Take your eight damage.
-MARISHA-
Eight damage, all right.
-MATT-
Eight points of bludgeoning damage, as you get palm knocked in the back of the skull.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-MATT-
That gripping divine fear, that pierced into your spirit, gets knocked from your head, as you shake yourself out of your--
-MARISHA-
I immediately, still in my Form of Dread turn to FCG and go: (growls)
-SAM-
Respect the gods! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
And then-- Last question.
-MATT-
Yeah?
-TALIESIN-
This is not quite 60 feet, is it? Between me and the guy with the crossbow.
-MATT-
No, they seem a little further than that.
-TALIESIN-
Shit. And I'm out of movement, aren't I?
-MATT-
You are at the moment, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
And I only have that one.
Can I do anything fucking else? Ah!
-MATT-
There's a skeleton to the immediate right of you.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, but they're all clearly fucking running, right?
-MATT-
They are at the moment, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm going to-- Can I hold? That's not an action.
I can't hold one attack.
-MATT-
No, unfortunately.
-TALIESIN-
Nah, that's a--
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I have no more movement.
I got nothing more right now.
-MATT-
All right.
The Captain, glancing over the side there, continues to pace and walk, glances over the shoulder at the shout of the flea that's joined the ship and gives a weird grin.
The teeth crack a little bit as the jaw seems to twist into a ghostly smile.
-LIAM-
Here come 10 guys that don't look happy.
-MATT-
Another bit of the water and the ocean begins to swirl.
(swirls) All righty, that brings us to this one on the ship next to you.
"Don't worry, Captain, I'll take him!" They're going to use bonus action Captain's Orders.
-LIAM-
Bob and weave.
-MATT-
This crew member here is going to immediately try to attack you.
That's going to be a 21 to hit.
-LIAM-
(disappointed noise)
-SAM-
Is that me?
-MATT-
That's Imogen.
-LAURA-
No, it's me.
-MATT-
You take six points of slashing damage and three cold.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
And then is going to switch back around after shouting the order and then go into two strikes against you.
-LIAM-
Bob and weave, bob and weave!
-MATT-
Natural one.
A lot of natural ones.
Natural 20! That's twice in the same battle I've gotten both back to back.
-LAURA-
What the heck?
-MATT-
That's crazy.
-LAURA-
That's twice he's done that.
-ASHLEY-
20 and a one?
-MATT-
Yeah. That's wild.
-ASHLEY-
Boy, a lot of 20s tonight.
-TRAVIS-
♪ 20 and one ♪
-TALIESIN-
Damn, damn, damn.
-MATT-
All righty.
That'll be 14 points of slashing damage.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
And 12 points of cold damage.
-LIAM-
26 total.
Got you, got you.
-MATT-
The first one goes wide and right as you are getting your bearings, you duck the first one, bring the shield up and you suddenly can't see it.
And then underneath the shield it's crouched down to almost a cockroach lower level.
(hisses)
-LIAM-
Ah!
-MATT-
And carves you up the front with his shortsword.
All right, that's going to finish their go.
Bringing it to Chetney.
-TRAVIS-
(whimpering garble) I mean (snarls) And I'm going to make a beeline for the boat, knowing I'll take attacks of opportunity.
-MATT-
That's 10 feet before you get to the difficult terrain.
Both then get attacks of opportunity against you.
That's going to be an 18.
-TRAVIS-
That's my AC.
-MATT-
So that does barely hit you.
And that's going to be a 12.
-TRAVIS-
Beautiful.
-MATT-
So one of them does hit you for nine points of slashing damage and six cold.
So it'd be five and so--
-TRAVIS-
Five and 11.
-MATT-
11, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Got you, okay.
-MATT-
All righty.
So that's five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
What's your full movement?
-TRAVIS-
It's 35.
-MATT-
35. So it's about as far as you can get right now.
Just starting to swim through the water.
It's now up to your chest.
-TRAVIS-
And am I within 30 feet of the guy up near Orym? Can I eyeball it?
-MATT-
They're a little bit outside of 30 feet.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, I will continue to swim towards the hull of the ship.
I'll keep going.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
We're going to board her, aye?
-MATT-
30, 35.
-LAURA-
Aye.
-TALIESIN-
Aye.
-MATT-
I'll say with the five feet in the previous one, that does go into an additional one and you're on the side and that's as far as you got.
But you're right there.
-TRAVIS-
Cool, cool.
-MATT-
Claws out, clung to this exterior of this rotted wood, as your fingers almost sink in because it's soft.
-TRAVIS-
Eugh.
-MATT-
All right, that finishes your go.
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
Laudna, you're up.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
Oh, fuck.
I'm going to start running to the ship, avoiding the whirlpool.
-MATT-
Okay, which direction?
-MARISHA-
Let's go through the middle of the two whirlpools.
-MATT-
All right, five, 10, 15, 20.
25, 30.
As you're now wading waist high in the water and now it's turning into difficult terrain.
-MARISHA-
I'll dash.
-MATT-
All righty.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to keep up the illusion that I'm still turned from FCG.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
So I'm still running frantically.
-MATT-
All right, as you're now running and now swimming into the water--
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
-- you glance up off the edge, and you can see the dwarven captain still pacing, but keeping an eye on you.
Just patiently watching.
-MARISHA-
Just looking at him with fear in my eyes.
-MATT-
Okay.
Finishing your go. It's now the Captain's go.
The Captain is still holding his action because of your--
-SAM-
Nice.
-MATT-
-- persuasion roll and is going to bonus action Command From the Grave.
-MARISHA-
Give me a ride.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
I tell him.
-MATT-
He is going to command--
-MARISHA-
Please.
Super please.
-LAURA-
Halp me.
-TRAVIS-
Halp.
-MATT-
This one.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-LIAM-
Son of a bitch.
-MATT-
20, 25 and leap here to 30.
-TRAVIS-
Got to go fast.
Clamber up-- oh god.
There we go.
Stay, buddy. There we go.
All right, and it's going to attack you.
For natural one.
I'm swinging wide this battle.
The pendulum is ping ponging.
-MATT-
No joke. All righty.
That's wild.
All right, that's going to finish his go.
That brings us back to Imogen.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-TALIESIN-
Hmm? Oh yeah.
Okay, hold on.
-SAM-
You're going to parley.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
I'm trying to think of something good.
-SAM-
It's either-- You're better at threatening them.
-LAURA-
That's dumb.
There's no point in that.
Hold on!
-TRAVIS-
Are the whirlpools holding in size or does it look like they're growing or shrinking at all, or moving?
-MATT-
The whirlpools look like they're staying for the time being.
Moving this a little bit closer, now that we're moving down the battlefield.
Moving it a little closer to you all.
-LAURA-
Okay.
I'm going to look at these two fuckers in front of me.
And my eyes are going to flare white and I'm going to say: Back the fuck off! I'm going to cast Shock Flare at 3rd-level.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
So--
-MATT-
Is that a dexterity save for them?
-LAURA-
Strength save.
-MATT-
Strength save.
(laughs) That's a natural two.
Two natural twos in a row.
-LAURA-
Great.
Then they both take 4d6 lightning damage.
-TALIESIN-
Nice.
-TRAVIS-
Dang.
That's not bad.
-LAURA-
It's not that much.
For...
12 points of lightning damage to each of them.
-MATT-
(lightning cracks) It blasts outward.
This one falls back (thudding) and collapses into a pile of bone at the bottom of the rock hill.
-LAURA-
Great.
And for my bonus action--
-SAM-
Bone?
-LAURA-
My bone-us action.
I will use two more meteors and slam them into the skeleton still standing.
-MATT-
You got it. So that's a dexterity save?
-LAURA-
Yes?
-SIRI-
I didn't get that.
-MATT-
Are you sure?
-SIRI-
Try again.
-LAURA-
Yeah. I'm going to use a dexterity save.
-MATT-
That's 10, failure.
That's going to be a 15.
Does that fail?
-LAURA-
They both.
-MATT-
All right, they fail.
-LAURA-
I'm going to stop rolling these dice because I keep getting the same numbers.
14 points of fire damage on that.
-MATT-
(impacts) They both get blasted back.
One catches the rock.
The other one gets thrown off the edge and crumples into a pile of shattered bones and armor.
As the other one's pulling itself back up, both meteors (impacts).
It goes arcing in the air where its torso pulls apart from the rest of its skeleton, and it falls into two pieces about five feet from each section.
-LAURA-
Ugh, they're going to get right back up.
-TALIESIN-
You got movement.
-LAURA-
I do.
I can't do that! It's a spell, Chet.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-TALIESIN-
I think he just did the move.
-TRAVIS-
I'm just saying toot.
-LAURA-
Just toot.
-MATT-
Psychic toot. (laughs)
-LAURA-
I'm going to get up on the high rock.
-SAM-
Up on your high horse?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Can you collect the-- Yeah, actually, did we collect the hole or did we leave the hole up there?
-LIAM-
Hole is still up there.
-MATT-
The hole is up there.
As you climb up onto the edge, I will say, make a dexterity saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
My fault.
-ASHLEY-
Where'd she go?
-SAM-
Ah!
-LAURA-
That's 18.
-MATT-
18? You get up the edge and whoa! Have to catch yourself.
And walk around the edge of a massive hole in the top of the rock.
-LAURA-
I'm actually going to just hang down.
-MATT-
Okay.
So you vanish into it.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Which gives you total cover while you're hanging there.
-LAURA-
That's great.
-MATT-
So there you go.
-SAM-
No, Imogen! (laughter)
-LIAM-
Like a Broadway trap door.
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
As long as nothing happens.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
Idina Menzel.
-LAURA-
I'm hanging on.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, you're right.
-LIAM-
Here comes the sniper, yeah?
-LAURA-
That's why I was just doing it to the sniper while I was standing up on the rock.
-TRAVIS-
It's so bad.
-TRAVIS-
He can't even make it up to--
-TRAVIS-
Adele Dazeem.
-MATT-
Nah.
-LAURA-
It's so awkward.
-MARISHA-
It's just so weird.
Just watch his brain just like short out.
-TALIESIN-
Guys.
-LIAM-
It's about to rain.
-MATT-
The sniper puts in another large bolt.
-SAM-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Here we fucking go.
-MATT-
Pulls it back, gets down, (cracking) and aims out past everyone--
-TRAVIS-
Achoo!
-MATT-
-- to you once more.
-SAM-
But I'm just a sweet boy!
-LAURA-
No!
-MATT-
You send the entirety of the crew running in a wave of divine--
-SAM-
He doesn't know that.
I mean, I guess I did--
-MATT-
It was very visible.
-SAM-
-- make a pretty big show of it.
-MATT-
It was extremely visible.
(laughter)
Bonus actions.
-TRAVIS-
"Why me?!"
-SAM-
There was a speech involved, yeah.
-MATT-
Bonus action to the sniper.
Gives them advantage.
-TRAVIS-
"There was a speech involved."
-MATT-
That's going to be a 20 to hit.
-SAM-
Hits!
-LIAM-
(groans)
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
I do love how we stand out in the open with a sniper in a nest.
There's all these like nice cover.
-LIAM-
I'm trying!
-TALIESIN-
I got a fucking plan, but.
-MATT-
Yeah, there's plenty of cover out there.
-SAM-
Do I get half cover from all of his friends?
-MATT-
Nope! No, you did not.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Sniper--
-MATT-
That is going to be 12 points of piercing damage.
-SAM-
Uh-huh.
-LIAM-
That's what I thought.
-MATT-
And 14 points of cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-SAM-
I'm down.
-LIAM-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
Unconscious?!
-SAM-
Unconscious.
-MARISHA-
Wow.
-MATT-
You hear once more the (whooshes).
The massive bolt streaks through with a high-pitched whine, and FCG gets blasted and tumbles.
(thuds) And skids.
-SAM-
Does that undo Turn Undead?
-MATT-
I'm going to double check the rules.
-LIAM-
Laura, help.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
Laura, wait.
-LIAM-
Not Imogen, just Laura.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
Just taken some fucking cover.
Goddamn it.
-SAM-
(mumbles)
-TALIESIN-
Don't think--
-MATT-
One minute until it takes damage.
So yeah.
-SAM-
So one minute.
-MATT-
Even while you're unconscious, they didn't even see it happen.
They're all still running from you.
-SAM-
They're running from my god, not from me.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Yeah, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, very humble.
-TALIESIN-
God fucking damn it.
-MATT-
But you are now laid out.
A secondary bolt sticking out of your torso right now.
-TRAVIS-
Still don't know how to do this.
-SAM-
Did he take more than one shot on me?
-TALIESIN-
I am now pointing at that motherfucker.
-MATT-
No, the was just one shot.
Is going to reload up, and take a secondary shot.
-LIAM-
Sum bitch.
-TALIESIN-
I am pointing at him.
-MATT-
This is going to be at down on the deck because you're now the other immediate threat.
-TALIESIN-
Oh shit.
I thought they were both coming for me.
Great.
-MATT-
(sarcastic laugh) That's going to be 13.
-LIAM-
(grunts)
-MATT-
(heavy impact) Splinters the wood.
(explosion) Shards of it go flying around you as it sticks about six inches out of the deck.
-LIAM-
Taller than me.
-MATT-
Yeah.
All right, that finishes their go.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-LAURA-
FCG's down.
-SAM-
I'm down!
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
Actually, you know what? They're going to step up.
-TRAVIS-
Cliff dive?
-MATT-
Then (whooshes)
-LIAM-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
Whoa!
-LIAM-
You got bones.
-MATT-
Over to the other top there.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-LIAM-
Jack Skellington hopping around.
-MATT-
Yeah, it succeeds.
-TALIESIN-
Motherfucker, I had plans.
Now, I got to save your butt.
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
All righty.
Finishing their go, the rest of the crew.
(crackling)
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy, this is a problem.
-LIAM-
(crackly) I'm back, baby.
-TALIESIN-
We were-- Ah!
-LAURA-
I hate them.
-MATT-
15.
They only get up that far.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
They spend half their movement to get there.
They're both going to dash with the rest of it.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MARISHA-
I wish.
Of course I had zero fucking--
-MATT-
They both fall into the hole.
(laughter)
Just (impacts) So you're holding onto the edge, and they go over top and they fall down 10 feet.
Both of them taking--
-MARISHA-
Is this into our hole?
-MATT-
They both take enough damage to fall in, and then immediately splinter out again.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
So wait, can you just?
-TRAVIS-
Dominoes!
-LAURA-
Yes, yes, yes.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, we can--
-MARISHA-
Fold it?
-ASHLEY-
♪ Do do do do do ♪
-MARISHA-
Then those guys are handled for a minute?
-TRAVIS-
So good.
-LIAM-
We can open that at any time.
(laughter)
-MATT-
These guys run over here into the water.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) That's pretty good.
-MATT-
Oh god.
-TALIESIN-
God fucking damn it.
-MATT-
They're running up behind you, splashing into the water.
-LIAM-
Look out, Laudna.
-MATT-
These two do run away, getting attack of opportunity from either of you, if you'd like.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'll take that.
Oh no, never mind.
-SAM-
If you hit them, they will stop running.
-TALIESIN-
That's right.
I'm like eh, no.
-LAURA-
Let them keep running.
We'll hit them when they stop.
-LAURA-
Let them keep running.
-MATT-
Both of these guys go running way off to the side.
-LAURA-
Let them run.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
(stilted) Let them run.
-MATT-
They are just bolting away.
This one here, who's still good, is going to turn.
-TRAVIS-
I don't know if I'd call him "good."
-TALIESIN-
Half--
-LAURA-
Look at the little--
-MARISHA-
Just this--
-LAURA-
Just this little baby.
-MATT-
Dash up to you.
-MARISHA-
Little tiny--
-MATT-
This little skeletal halfling is like (high-pitched yell).
(laughter)
Just comes out.
Just (skitters).
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-TRAVIS-
No, no, no, no.
-MATT-
Like little baby zombies in Minecraft.
They're like (skitters).
-MARISHA-
That's exactly what I was thinking of.
-MATT-
Yep.
-MARISHA-
Ah!
-MATT-
Get away, ah! Ah!
-LIAM-
What's the name of Hook's sidekick? LAURA, MARISHA, MATT,
-TALIESIN-
Smee.
-LIAM-
That's what it is.
-MATT-
There you go.
-ASHLEY-
Smee.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
-MATT-
But it took its action to dash to get there, so it runs up to you.
(growls) At your base of you.
Finishing their go now, FCG, you're up, with Fearne on deck.
-SAM-
I'm up?
-MATT-
Yep, I need you to make a death saving throw for me, please.
-SAM-
All right.
Nope.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-MATT-
First fail.
-TRAVIS-
Wow! <i>Wow!</i>
-MATT-
All righty.
Fearne, your go.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
I'm confident.
-TRAVIS-
Don't get bit.
-ASHLEY-
Standby.
-SAM-
I'm confident.
You know why? Because I've got the gods.
-MARISHA-
Do want to use my tattoo?
-SAM-
I do want to use your tattoo.
-ASHLEY-
I'm just wondering.
-SAM-
I don't have anything to write on it with.
-ASHLEY-
If I'm going to be petty because of what he did to Laudna.
-MARISHA-
It's not permanent.
-ASHLEY-
I'm not going to be petty.
-SAM-
Death is permanent.
Wait, are these the deaths?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, the dark ones.
-TALIESIN-
You can be any petty b-word.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Fearne, what you got?
-ASHLEY-
I am going to cast Cure Wounds.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
On this dumbass.
(laughter)
I'm going to do it at 2nd-level, maybe? I'm going to do it at 2nd-level.
-MATT-
All right, so it's 2d8 plus your wisdom.
-TRAVIS-
The question mark.
-MATT-
I know.
-SAM-
It can be the most basic one.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no, I'm going to do--
-SAM-
All I need is one hit point.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to do Cure Wounds at 1st-level.
-SAM-
That's fine, that's fine.
-MATT-
All right, so 1d8 plus your wisdom.
-LAURA-
What if you get hit immediately?
-SAM-
She'll have to do it again.
-LIAM-
A crossbow hit, it's enough to take out a 2nd-level healer--
-ASHLEY-
(laughs) Okay.
-LIAM-
-- so saving's not--
-ASHLEY-
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Hang on.
Eight points.
-SAM-
Amazing.
-MATT-
So come back to consciousness.
Two bolts sticking two feet out of your torso.
-SAM-
(groans)
-ASHLEY-
Get up, get up.
-SAM-
Why are you mad at me?
-ASHLEY-
Because you-- Look what you did to Laudna! You just threw everything off.
-SAM-
I'm sorry.
-ASHLEY-
It's all right, it's all right.
-SAM-
Do you want me to be dead again?
-TALIESIN-
Can we get them out of the way?
-ASHLEY-
No, all right.
So.
Okay, so that was my action.
So then--
-SAM-
(loud belch)
-LIAM-
(groans)
-LAURA-
Nice.
-ASHLEY-
As a--
-LAURA-
That's a post-death burp.
-SAM-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
I don't think I can-- nope.
Shit.
All right.
-SAM-
When I was dead, I realized.
-ASHLEY-
As a bonus action.
-SAM-
I had a lot of gas.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
I believe, can I do a 2nd-level bonus action?
-MATT-
You've already cast a spell with your action, so you can only do a bonus action that's a cantrip, unfortunately.
-ASHLEY-
Got it, okay.
Stand by.
All right, I'm going to, I'm going to do Caleb's Produce Flame cantrip.
I'm going to put my--
-LIAM-
Love that it's an artifact floating in.
-MATT-
Is it a bonus action? Oh god.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, no, it's not a bonus action.
I'm sorry.
-MATT-
Put that back on top there, if you don't mind.
-ASHLEY-
No, it's not a bonus action.
What am I doing?
-MATT-
There you go.
-TALIESIN-
Anything with this little fucker next to me, so.
-ASHLEY-
All right, I'm going to-- If I try to attack the little guy, am I able to also do my movement? I don't know why I'm having such a brain fart.
-MATT-
You can move still, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to melee attack the little guy.
-MATT-
Well, you've used your action to cast Cure Wounds.
-ASHLEY-
What am I doing? Okay.
-MATT-
That's okay.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to keep walking towards the boat.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
And then!
-MATT-
20, 25, the one that ran up to you goes (snarls) and strikes out with--
-ASHLEY-
I have 35 feet of movement.
-MATT-
Correct.
So move you to about there.
All right, so that one's going to attack you.
That's going to be a 14 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
Does not hit.
-MATT-
Does not hit.
-ASHLEY-
But because of my fire shield, and if he took a melee attack at me, he takes damage.
-MATT-
Ah.
-TALIESIN-
Can I do this?
-MATT-
Hits you with melee attack.
So it has to hit you to take the fire damage.
-ASHLEY-
Copy that. I don't understand any of this.
All right, and now Mister.
Where's Mister?
-MATT-
Mister's right over here.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.

All right, finishing Fearne's go.
Up of the round, Orym.
-ASHLEY-
Got you back up.
-LIAM-
Cool, I'm going to grab hold of this giant crossbow bolt in the deck and swing around into the enemy next to me and try to do a pushing attack into the water.
-MATT-
Okay, so you swing around here.
-LIAM-
That is a 27 to hit.
-MATT-
27 definitely hits.
-LIAM-
Has to beat to DC 17 strength.
-MATT-
This is a shove, all right.
-LIAM-
It's a pushing attack 15 feet.
-MATT-
Oh, pushing attack, that's right.
Okay, so it has a--

17.
-MATT-
17 points of damage?
-TRAVIS-
No, beat a 17.
-MATT-
Oh, 17 strength.
-LIAM-
Strength save, yeah.
-MATT-
What was the damage on it?
-LIAM-
Oh, I didn't do it yet.
Four and six is 10, plus-- 12.
-MATT-
12 points of damage, and that is a natural 19.
-LIAM-
Oh, I will rebound off of it, hit the ground, and then drive my shoulder and the blade in again and do it again.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
That misses, that's 12.
-MATT-
12 misses, unfortunately.
So the first one, you strike.
"Ah! Captain!" Gets back on, puts the blade ready.
This one, it parries it to the side.
and you both are in a standoff position.
-LIAM-
Hold ground.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Yeah.

I'm going to take a big wide swing straight on.
I'm going to reckless.

That's 16 to hit.
-MATT-
16 hits.
-TALIESIN-
Actually, 20 to hit, excuse me.
I don't know why--
-MATT-
Still hits.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Even more.
-TALIESIN-
Let's do, let's do some damage.
Let's do 20 points of damage.
-MATT-
20 points of damage.
"(chittering)" (bashing) It breaks into the ground as you slam it upward.
Scatters a bit across the sand.

Thank you, <i>Ashton</i>.

Well, I mean, this is the question.
I'm now going to teleport.

You saved me.

How far can you teleport?
-TALIESIN-
60 feet.
-MATT-
Where do you want to go?

Oh, we're going to have beef now?
-TALIESIN-
I want to head this way, right by that.
Like how far can I?

Here?
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I can go that far? I want to go right to that, right behind that icicle on the other side.
-MATT-
Over here?

Like right on the other side of it.
A little further. Here--

Yeah, one back from that little whirlpool.
It makes me nervous.

Okay.

60-foot range.
Yep, they're within range.

All right, this is going to be fun.
What are we going to do? All right, want to put aside all the dice I'm about to use for this shit.
Then, sorry.
I'm using a thing I never use.
Oh yeah, there we go.
-LIAM-
I didn't want to interrupt.
Can ret in a bonus Second Wind?
-MATT-
Sure.
-LIAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
I'll allow it.
-TALIESIN-
Let's burn a point in that.
There we are.
-TRAVIS-

-TALIESIN-
Oh, I can't do it that way.
That's okay.
-TRAVIS-
♪ What's your-- ♪
-TALIESIN-
Go away.
Yeah, all right.
-MATT-
Roll an attack.
-TALIESIN-
So rolling my attack.
-SAM-

-TALIESIN-
Come on.
Don't fuck up.
12?
-MATT-
12?
-TALIESIN-
Oh wait, this one's cocked.
Thank fucking god.
Oh wow, that's way better.
Sorry, this one's like, ah.
Okay.
-MATT-
(laughs) That was a journey.
-TRAVIS-
Long walk.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I was like, "Okay, I'm looking at it funny." Thank god.
Shit.
29.
-MATT-
29 definitely hits.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, that scared me.
So that's--
-TRAVIS-
Unleash the hounds.
-TALIESIN-
If this works.
That's-- It's 11 plus--
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
That's 23 points of damage.
-MATT-
23 points of damage.
-TALIESIN-
He gets shoved one square from forward because the hammer's coming from behind.
-MATT-
That's true.
-TALIESIN-
The other way.
-MATT-
So.
-LIAM-
Back of the head.
-MATT-
As it's getting the bolt ready for the second shot, you swing your hammer, and as you swing it, partway through, your arms vanish for a moment.
From behind, a portal opens, and the hammer crack! Hits the sniper from behind and (shrieking) tumble ass over tea kettle off the side.
-TRAVIS-
Damn, that's some good rage, bro.
-MATT-
Onto the deck.
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-MATT-
So how much damage was that? That was 23.
-TALIESIN-
That was 23.
-MATT-
Plus 50 feet to the ground.
-SAM-
That's 50 points.
-MATT-
So that is--
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
5d6?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
(laughs) 15 points of bludgeoning damage, and it is prone.
It hits the deck with a heavy thud.
Parts of the deck splinters up around it.
You see the skeleton's like (grunts).
-TALIESIN-
Is he not quite down?
-MATT-
No, no, it's still standing.
-TRAVIS-
He's a hardy one.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
The ones on the ship seem to be made of a stronger, sturdier stuff than the regular crew members.
-TALIESIN-
I still have some movement, which is disgusting, but true.
15, 20, 25.
I can't quite make it, shit.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
(laughs) What a lackluster turn.
That was fucking awesome.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to try and head back to FCG.
-MATT-
All righty.
So five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 gets you right there.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-TRAVIS-
Damn, what?!
-MARISHA-
Good turn.
-TRAVIS-
Globe trotting motherfucker.
-TALIESIN-
(heavy panting)
-LIAM-
Doony-mancy.
-LAURA-
That's really cool.
Doody-mancy.
-MATT-
All right.
The captain--
-TALIESIN-
If this fucker hadn't gone down, it would've been way worse.
-TRAVIS-
You didn't give me a high five.
-TALIESIN-
It should've been way crazier.
-MATT-
The captain's still pacing and watching.
Then gives a nod to the water and the whirlpool--
-TRAVIS-
Oh?
-MATT-
-- shifts.
-TRAVIS-
Nod?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-ALL-
Whoa!
-SAM-
Oh, it serves you right! (laughter)
-MATT-
Now the water's (whooshes).
-MARISHA-
Did he move it?
-TRAVIS-
He just moved it.
-MATT-
So it moves underneath.
We'll come to that on your turn.
-TALIESIN-
Oh god.
-MATT-
It is now the individual's turn.
The one that's fighting you on the deck is going to try and dance around to this side.
"I know your game!" And is going to attempt to do a shove strike on you.
Go ahead and make an athletics check.
-LIAM-
Oh good.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
Well, let me double- check to make sure if it's athletics or athletics and acrobatics.
Keep coming back to this, but I just want to make sure, so I don't get reamed.
-TALIESIN-
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Ah!
-SAM-
He's pushing you, Orym?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
So you can make athletics or acrobatics, your choice.
-SAM-
Oh, you're fine.
-LIAM-
I'll do acrobatics, try to dodge.
That is a 20.
-MATT-
They got a 20 as well.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-LIAM-
Well, I will use Zephran Heart.
-MATT-
Well, 20 is meet or beat, so you did actually beat it on the first strike.
-LIAM-
Oh, then I will not do that.
Okay.
-MATT-
Frustrated by how you just-- they try and bash you in the side, and you pull up the shield and you both (clashing) your feet slide about an inch, but it's barely any movement.
Angrily, is going to spin around with its shortsword and try and stab you over the shield.
-TALIESIN-
Shit.
-LIAM-
That's pretty hard to do.
-MATT-
That is going to be (laughs) 12.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Raise the shield up higher. (shield clangs)
-MATT-
(snarls) Is going to now shout over here the captain's orders to the one next to it.
This one's going to be like, "Make sure you shoot true." So we'll see whatever that gets to.
-LIAM-
It smells real bad.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
All right, that finishes its go.
Chetney, you're up.
Laudna, your on deck.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, can I try--
-MATT-
Actually, beginning your turn, because you're in the water--
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh?
-MATT-
The freezing ice cold waters around you begin to cause your body temperature to drop deeply.
-TRAVIS-
(shivers)
-MATT-
You take 10 points of cold damage.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
Whoa!
-TRAVIS-
This shit's cold around this boat.
-MARISHA-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Good thing I've been doing cold plunges every morning before I joined the--
-MATT-
(laughs) All right, now it's still your turn, what do you want to do?
-TRAVIS-
Claws in the hull, can I climb up the side and get up onto the deck?
-MATT-
15, 20.
-SAM-
Chetney, you're--
-MATT-
25 gets you right about there.
-TRAVIS-
Can I use the rest of my movement to get right over the guy that fell--
-MATT-
Yeah, you can.
-TRAVIS-
-- from the crow's nest?
-MATT-
Right up next to it.
-LAURA-
(laughs deviously)
-TRAVIS-
With my action, can I reach down and try and wrestle that big fucking heavy crossbow out of his stupid hands?
-LIAM-
Yes!
-MATT-
(laughs) Sure.
Make an--
-SAM-
Come on.
-MATT-
This will be a strength versus strength test.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, just a straight-up strength roll?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
He's got no meat on his bones.
-MATT-
Now, you are transformed, which means you have an advantage on the strength roll if I recall.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I do.
That's even better. 23!
-MATT-
23. (laughs) He rolled a natural 19.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-SAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
Plus two, 21.
(exclaiming)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
So it's on the ground, (groans).
As you clamber up (clunky climbing) onto the ship.
It's like, (grunts) getting up, it sees you.
It goes and grabs its crossbow and tries to start getting up, as you get your claws onto it.
There's a brief tug of war before you-- (rips)
-TRAVIS-
Drop it!
-MATT-
-- tear it free from its grasp.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Drop it.
-TRAVIS-
Could I toss it into the waters over the ship?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
I just-- (clunks)
-LIAM-
Nerfed.
-MATT-
(splashes) It hits the water, and the water where it splashes through freezes up for a second--
-SAM-
Ooh.
-MATT-
-- before it begins to rapidly melt.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh! With my bonus action, can I use Blood Curse of Bloated Agony on the guy that Orym is fighting?
-MATT-
Yeah, sure.
-TRAVIS-
And that's it.
-MATT-
The challenge is, they don't have blood.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Can't bloat.
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-TALIESIN-
Nope.

Blood curses only affect creatures unless they're constructs or undead.

It's a cursed sword that talks to him.
So I figured it would go good with your whole aesthetic.
-SAM-

Okay, okay, okay.

-MATT-
18, and what's your response to his question? (snarling exhale)
-MARISHA-
I'm trying to remember what the fuck his sword does.
-SAM-
I don't even know if you know it's cursed.
-LAURA-
It's got the soul of a king trapped in it, that's all, right?

Uh-huh.
Okay, okay.

-MARISHA-
Yes.

Fucking creeper.

-LAURA-
You should've seen him today and peeking his head in the dressing room.
-MARISHA-
It imbues him.
-MATT-
You were putting on makeup.
You weren't getting dressed.
I just want to specify.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Aw, you should've seen him earlier when I was taking a shit.
-LIAM-
Insight check.
-SAM-
He was like-- (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Hard to read.
-MATT-
I felt like it was important to specify.
(laughter)
It sounded real bad out of context.

Nah, bitch.

All righty.
That brings us to Imogen.

-LIAM-
Let's go, 'Mo.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Imo.
-LAURA-
I'm going to peek my head up out and come out of the little hole.
-MATT-
Okay.

(grunts) Am I within 120 feet of the ship?
-MATT-
Maybe.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LIAM-

-LAURA-
I feel like, looking at it--
-MATT-
At a glance, it could be.
It's pretty close.
-LIAM-
So are they about to get up again?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm coming out of the hole and I'm standing on the rock.
Right.
-TALIESIN-
But if you walk, you'll get closer.
-LAURA-
Would it take an action to pick up the scarf or is that something I can do as I come up and out?
-MATT-
To pick up the scarf?
-LAURA-
The scarf off the ground.
-MATT-
Oh, the hole you mean?
-LAURA-
Yeah, would that take an action or could I just?
-MATT-
It's an action, because it's grabbing the lips and taking it and folding it up.
-LAURA-
All right.
In that case, I'm going to leave the hole on the ground.
I'm going to come out and step down.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
I think, once I'm down on this next level, that's 120 feet.
Cheez Whiz.
-MATT-
Could be.
-LAURA-
Cheez Whiz.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Cheez Whiz.
-LAURA-
Could I get a little closer then?
-MATT-
Sure.
-LAURA-
To where I feel like I would be?
-MATT-
As you're leaping down, you can get about there, would be you movement.
-LAURA-
Okay.

Okay. 120 feet?
-TRAVIS-
Dang, from the 120?

-LAURA-
Sweet.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!

Pew, pew.

-ASHLEY-
Pew, pew.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So that's saving throw on their end, intelligence saving throw?
-LAURA-
Intelligence saving throw.
-MATT-
All right.
That's a fail.
And, ooh, it's pretty good, but that's still going to be a 17.
-LAURA-
18.
-MATT-
Fail.
-LIAM-
Ooh.
-LAURA-
So that is 7d6 psychic damage.
-MATT-
Ooh.
-LAURA-
They both are incapacitated until the start of my next turn.
-TRAVIS-
Dang.
-MATT-
That's great.
-LAURA-
Two.
-TALIESIN-
Damn.
-LAURA-
One, two.
Hold on, let me find them.
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Whoa.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's way better.
12, 17, 19, 23, 26, 29 points of psychic damage to both of them.
-MATT-
Both of those skeletons, (groans) and crumple to the ground.
-LAURA-
(gasps) Yes.
-TALIESIN-
How do you kill the dead?
-SAM-
Dead forever.
-LAURA-
Forever.
-TRAVIS-
Who's dead forever?
-LAURA-
Both of them.
-ASHLEY-
Dang it.
-SAM-
Those skeletons who were--
-LAURA-

-MATT-
The one that you pulled the crossbow away from and threw it in the water, it starts getting back and (groans) You don't even <i>see</i> what happened.
-TRAVIS-
Misses his crossbow.
(laughs)
-MATT-
Yeah, those of you who are glancing over in the direction, you can see the air between Imogen and the ship ripples, (pulses) rapidly.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-ASHLEY-
Cool!
-TALIESIN-
Pop, pop.
-MATT-
Does that finish your turn?
-LAURA-
Sweet.
-TALIESIN-
(pops)
-TRAVIS-
Sonic boom.
(booms)
-TALIESIN-
It goes (plops)
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
I can't use any more movement, can I?
-MATT-
Nah, sorry, that was your movement to get down there, unfortunately.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay, yeah, that's what I'll do.
-MATT-
Okay. (rattles)
-TRAVIS-
That's what I'll do.
-MATT-
Top of this turn, that one gets back up, (whooshes) but it's still incapacitated.
So technically, incapacitated means it, hmm.
-LAURA-
It can't take any actions.
-MATT-
It can't take any <i>actions</i>, but it can still get back up and move.
-TRAVIS-
Huh.
-MATT-
It's like, (grunts) and then it glances to you, you see its blackened skeleton crackling, and you can see, it's the interior of it is almost like a molten bone.
-TRAVIS-
(thuds) (laughter)
-MATT-
(cracks)
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
-MATT-
It's not going to move.
-TRAVIS-
Does that mean no reactions, either?
-MARISHA-
Both.
-LAURA-
It can't do anything.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Yep.
So finishing that go.
(whooshes) The rest of the crew keep running. (scurries) (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
♪ Keep on running ♪
-MATT-
Running back to the ship.
Running back to the ship.
(scurries)
-TALIESIN-
Then they're going to run over the ship.
-MATT-
This one here.
-TALIESIN-
Off the ship.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Are they swimming? They're swimming, right?
-MATT-
They're swimming through.
(splashes) Those two go running into the bushes (laughs) over that way.
Can't reach them from here, it's fine.
These two get back up and start climbing out of the hole, then clamber down. (thuds)
-TALIESIN-
Do they have to have--
-MARISHA-
Oh wait, they're climbing out of the hole?
-TALIESIN-
-- half their movement?
-MATT-
Half their movement to get out, then they dash to get down, which means they can't do--
-LAURA-
Didn't they have to climb out of the hole? The hole is--
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
So did you.
-LAURA-
Yeah, but I was hanging.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
They weren't, okay.
-MATT-
It's not a sheer wall there.
You have things in there, they leap up and climb their way up.
But it used up a lot of their movement, which is why they had to get up to the top and then dash to even get to you.
So they don't even attack you at all.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
It's their full round to even try and get to you.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
This one gets up.
-SAM-
and TRAVIS: (groaning)
-MATT-
Is immediately going to go after your, FCG.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-SAM-
But I'm a sweet--
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
Because you are prone, it has advantage.
(laughs) Even with advantage, it's a 15 on the first attack.
-SAM-
That misses.
-MATT-
That misses. The second one with advantage.
Man, come on, come on, come on.
That's better! 19.
-SAM-
Hit.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Hey, I didn't use bonus, though, on my turn, right?
-MATT-
That's true, you did not.
-LAURA-
Can I--?
-MARISHA-
Use it again.
Reset it. (laughs)
-MATT-
That'd be five points of slashing damage and four cold.
-SAM-
I'm down again.
-ASHLEY-
No, you're not.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Get your shit together!
-SAM-
You should've given me that fucking 2nd-level.
-LAURA-
I would realize, was he within five feet of FCG?
-TALIESIN-
It wouldn't have fucking mattered.
-SAM-
No, it would have.
-LAURA-
-- when I did my turn?
-TALIESIN-
No, no, it would not have, because your turn--
-MATT-
Yeah, he was.
-LAURA-
He was? Okay.
-TALIESIN-
-- still would've never come. It would've just hit you again.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
Because this one would've already gotten you.
-SAM-
But I would still be alive right now.
-MATT-
That finishes their go.
-TALIESIN-
You would be down because that fucker would be right on top of you.
-MATT-
FCG.
-SAM-
What fucker?
-MARISHA-
What are you talking about?
-SAM-
The fucker--
-TALIESIN-
The one who just killed you again.
-SAM-
Yeah, but he just did.
I had eight points.
-MARISHA-
He would've still been alive.
-SAM-
They did nine points of damage.
-MATT-
FCG.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I'm the asshole here.
-MATT-
Death save.
-SAM-
Ugh, death save.
This is an important roll, guys.
-TRAVIS-
(burps)
-MARISHA-
Aw, jesus.
-SAM-
I'm going to do it--
-MARISHA-
Why?!
-SAM-
-- with my special rolling device--
-MATT-
What?
-SAM-
-- that's been here the entire campaign.
-TRAVIS-
What's that smell that just came?
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
What?
-TALIESIN-
A dice tower?
-SAM-
This has always been a transformer.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-SAM-
It's also a dice tower.
-MARISHA-
A dice tower?
-MATT-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
Six.
-TRAVIS-
What came out? (laughter)
What came out?
-LIAM-
That's just right!
-MATT-
What?
-LIAM-
That's just right.
-TRAVIS-
You don't drink out of those parts, do you?
-MATT-
Back to one failed save.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Ugh.
-ASHLEY-
Ugh.
-MATT-
All righty.
Fearne, you're up. At the top of your turn--
-ASHLEY-
I also forgot, I know it's too late now, but to know for next time.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
With my enhanced bond when I do an extra d8, when Mister is out I can also do it to restore hit points.
So I could've done an extra d8.
-MATT-
Well, good thing to know for the future.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Top of your turn, because you are in the water, in the whirlpool.
You do start feeling the freezing energy of the darkened ghost ship's dark, cursed magic.
You take 10 points of cold damage.
-ASHLEY-
I have my fire shields.
-MATT-
Which would make it just five.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Your movement is reduced even further.
So it's considered difficult terrain, but your speed is halved, which means you can really only move like five feet, this turn.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so--
-MATT-
It's like, (water whooshing).
The water's pulling you towards the center.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-ASHLEY-
Since I have Mister, I would like to, can I use Fiery Teleportation?
-MATT-
You can.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so I'm going to use Fiery Teleportation to 15 feet to try to get out of the whirlpool.
-MATT-
Okay, so you both move five feet this way, probably, and then--
-ASHLEY-
I'm actually going to move to the side.
-MATT-
All right.
(crunching impact)
-ASHLEY-
Because I feel like I need to.
-MATT-
All righty, so a burst of flame and you both (poof) appear 15 feet over to that side.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I guess I wouldn't have known if FCG went down again.
-SAM-
Oh yeah, because you're in a whirlpool <i>of hatred</i>.
-TALIESIN-
Mm, I don't know, would you?
-ASHLEY-
Pop out, I see him laying down again.
-SAM-
I was laying down when you went in.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Look over at him, you would see.
-MATT-
I'll tell you what, make a perception check.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
It's not like my body goes limp.
-ASHLEY-
I'm feeling really guilty, that's why.
-LIAM-
Maybe he's facing a different direction this time.
-MATT-
That's okay.
-LIAM-
Hope she rolls high.
-ASHLEY-
16.
-MATT-
16.
I'll say 15 would've been the DC of just glancing over and hearing the sound of FCG taking another hit, looking behind and seeing the other skeleton (snarls) clawing him and then hitting him with a blade.
-TALIESIN-
I'd be swearing loudly, too.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
There'd be some loud swearing.
-ASHLEY-
So I will make my way over there back to FCG.
-MARISHA-
♪ Makin' my way ♪
-ASHLEY-
I was so close to the ship!
-SAM-
You don't have to heal me. I'll be fine.
Someone else will heal me.
-MATT-
All righty.
-SAM-
Ashton can heal me.
-TALIESIN-
The thing's going to get right the fuck back up.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
I'm going to pump him up with a 2nd-level Cure Wounds.
I'm going to pump him up with a 2nd-level Cure Wounds.
-MATT-
All righty.
-ASHLEY-
And, I get extra 3d8.
13.
-SAM-
Hey!
-MATT-
13 hit points healing to you, FCG.
-ASHLEY-
That wasn't great.
-MATT-
Does that finish your turn, Fearne?
-ASHLEY-
That finishes my turn.
-MATT-
Orym, you're up.
-SAM-
Fearne, thank you!
-LIAM-
Okay.
I get advantage on this--
-ASHLEY-
I felt guilty!
-LIAM-
-- anything I do to this character, because it's unconscious, right?
-MATT-
On the ground there?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That one is currently at zero hit points.
-LIAM-
I know that, but I've seen these things get back up.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
So, I want to do something to it.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Okay.
So I want to make a pushing attack.
I want to jam my blade into the deck and then jack rabbit kick it towards that side of the ship with a pushing attack.
-MATT-
This side? Okay, yeah.
-LIAM-
I'll reroll the one.
That is, 21 is the higher.
-MATT-
21, it auto fails.
-LIAM-
Auto fail.
-MATT-
Like, (whooshes) gets shoved to there.
-LIAM-
15 feet.
-MATT-
15 feet.
-LIAM-
I think that's off the ship.
-LAURA-
Yes.
-LIAM-
That's the thing with fleas, really fucking strong legs.
Then I'll turn and approach the other one.
I'll get right next to the Chet, actually.
-MATT-
Right next to Chet?
-LIAM-
Yep.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
I'll just attack.
That is a 15 to hit.
-MATT-
15, just hits.
-LIAM-
Just hits, pushing attack.
Strength save, 17.
-MATT-
Natural 19, I keep getting natural 19s.
-LAURA-
It's incapacitated.
-MATT-
It's incapacitated.
Yeah, you're right, so I'll say that he can't take any actions but I think it still, it saves against things.
It doesn't auto fail saves, I don't think.
I'll double check.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
♪ I'll double check ♪
-LIAM-
Regardless, it takes 17 points of damage.
-MATT-
Understood.
-TRAVIS-
♪ 17 points of damage ♪
-MATT-
Incapacitate...
-LAURA-
Can't take actions or reactions.
-MATT-
Correct. So yeah, it can still save.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So that's fine.
Okay. So anyway, with that being said.
So yeah, anyway, that was a natural 19.
-LIAM-
Okay, so it's still on the ship, but I hit it for 17 points--
-MATT-
Correct.
-LIAM-
-- of damage.
-MATT-
Which knocks it back down to zero.
-LIAM-
For another six seconds.
(laughter)
-MATT-
All righty. Does that finish your turn?
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm out, tapped.
-MATT-
All righty.
Ashton, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
You think you can handle this?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah. Go.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
I'm going to hit that tiny little motherfucker--
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
-- that's sitting there and I'm going to do a reckless attack, because that's fun for...
29 to hit.
-MATT-
Your minimum damage knocks him out.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
He's down?
-MATT-
(laughs) He's down.
Like, you could roll the worst you can possibly roll and he is (thumps).
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to go get our shit.
I'm going to teleport 60 feet over there to just behind those two skeletons.
-MATT-
Right there?
-TALIESIN-
Am I within striking distance?
-MATT-
Of the one right there, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Now, I'm going to use that second hit on that piece of shit.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TALIESIN-
The one on the right, that's 25 to hit.
-MATT-
25 to hit, minimum damage, knocks it down.
-TALIESIN-
I'm also going to use my push to push him five feet to the left.
-MATT-
Crumples in the middle there.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to, you're fine, I'm going to hop up and get ready in my next turn to grab the--
-MATT-
Up at the edge?
-TALIESIN-
Actually--
-MATT-
Put you right there.
-LIAM-
Those fucking skeletons are a pain in the ass.
-LAURA-
Yeah, they are.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
-MATT-
Thing about ghost ships.
They're a pain in the ass.
-TALIESIN-
I don't even have to run.
I actually, I end up just teleporting.
I'm going to teleport right next to it.
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
(whooshes) Fuck.
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Us, one week earlier: Ghost ship! (clapping) Yay! This'll be so cool.
-LAURA-
Gosh.
-MATT-
Finishing your turn? All right. (intense thumps) Climbing up the side of the boat--
-LIAM-
Ah!
-MATT-
-- this.
-LIAM-
So fast.
-LAURA-
Wow, that was so fast.
-MATT-
Their turn was next.
But getting up and climbing the side of the boat and getting to the edge gets them their movement and then their action is going to rush forward towards you as a dash and get there and be like, "Captain, what's the plan?" They're going to look back at the captain and the captain puts their hand up like this, still looking at Laudna.
-LAURA-
Was that a dash? Is it an action?
-MATT-
Yeah, their action was their dash.
It was movement and then dash, so they don't--
-LAURA-
But then they can't do it because they're incapacitated.
-LIAM-
Up the side of the boat.
-TRAVIS-
Until your turn?
-LIAM-
No, yeah.
-LAURA-
Until my turn, they're--
-MATT-
Oh, until your next turn?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So yeah, they're not going to get there then, you're right.
-LIAM-
Fuck off, dead guy.
-MATT-
Goes to back there.
-TRAVIS-
"Guess I fucked up." That's a monstrous fail.
-MATT-
All righty, it's really good.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, it's--
-MATT-
Thank you for the reminder.
All righty, finishing their go.
Chetney, then Laudna.
-TRAVIS-
I will make-- (deeply) make my way (regular voice) towards Laudna and the captain and I will unsheathe Graz'tchar, the Luminary Blade.
-MATT-
Okay.
You pull it free and it gleams here from the fog that surrounds it.
It gives off its own faint radiant glow and at the back of your mind, you hear, "Old friend, here you draw me forth.
Together, we will return to that insidious place in the mountain and destroy the first of many enemies of freedom."
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) Not yet, first we kill ghost pirates.
I'll come up behind Laudna and hold the--
-MATT-
So dash up to there?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
Hold the blade out and I'll say: (deeply) I beg you to reconsider if you want your compass.
We ask but a simple journey across the seas.
Fuck.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Just give him a little wink.
Told you.
-MATT-
All right, so that finishes your turn.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Because he is kind of listening, make a persuasion check on your point as well.
-MARISHA-
Does it get advantage because, (mumbles)?
-MATT-
No, because--
-MARISHA-
(mumbling) Okay.
-MATT-
Unfortunately, no, but the DC isn't super high.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, oh, oh.
-SAM-
I mean I did cast Enhance Ability on you.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
But you fell unconscious and lost your concentration.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
A natural 17.
-MATT-
17.
Looks at you, looks at the blade you're holding, you're holding it a threatening way.
He's looking at it like someone who's enjoying their walk through an antique shop and glances back over at you, finishing your turn.
Laudna, it's your go.
-MARISHA-
(nervous scream)
-MATT-
"So you're asking for passage.
In trade.
You all live, you give me my compass, and this fine weapon."
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) What? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Just go: Sorry.
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) What do you mean, sorry? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Compass first, the sword upon arrival.
-MATT-
"I've made clear the deal specifications.
We end this now, or you all die."
-MARISHA-
You know, a girl has to have collateral.
Am I really supposed to trust a bunch of pirates?
-MATT-
Make one final persuasion check.
-ALL-
Come on!
-SAM-
Come on.
-LIAM-
Laudna.
-SAM-
Guidance, Guidance, Guidance.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Now because of your success, the DC is pretty low right here.
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
No argument.
-MATT-
I'll set it at a 15 DC.
-ALL-
(vocalizing)
-MATT-
Oh jeez.
-SAM-
(vocalizing)
-MARISHA-
15 or higher?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
(vocalizing)
-LIAM-
Girl.
-LAURA-
♪ No, no ♪
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, it was on the...
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
You have a lot of modifiers.
-MARISHA-
No.
-SAM-
Add those modifiers.
-MARISHA-
10.
-MATT-
10 "Collateral doesn't sound right to me.
The blade now, the compass after, or I tell them to set loose."
-MARISHA-
I look at Chetney.
-TRAVIS-
(rapid growls)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(rabidly growls)
-ASHLEY-
Oh, thank you.
-LIAM-
Get rid of it.
-TRAVIS-
I'll flip the blade so I catch the blade.
-MARISHA-
Can't get rid of it.
-TRAVIS-
I don't say anything about that yet.
<i>Yet.</i>
-MATT-
(Graz'tchar) "What are you doing?" (laughter)
"We are bonded, you and I."
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) Don't make this harder than it has to be.
-MATT-
"You hold your destiny before you."
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) We'll see each other again.
Time cannot separate us, death is but a door.
(laughter)
-MATT-
The captain grasps the handle of the blade and holds it up.
-LIAM-
Oh, come on.
-MATT-
(Captain) "Accepted."
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-MATT-
As he bows his head, he closes his hand.
All the skeletons that have been running away continue to run up onto the ship.
The skeletons that are getting back up off the ground stop and snap up into their spaces and look back, no longer aggressive in their stance.
The ones that are across the way that reform and eventually begin to return.
But they're all casually walking now as the captain gives a horrible ghostly echoing whistle and they all begin to slowly return to the ship.
-TRAVIS-
I swipe his head.
(thumps) (laughter)
-MATT-
And that's where we'll go to break.
(groaning)
-ASHLEY-
Fun!
-MATT-
So we'll come back here in a few minutes and see how the rest of this conversation goes.
-LAURA-
Parley! Parley!
-MATT-
That was awesome.
It is time! Time to wake up...
to a new reality.
To a blank canvas that I have painted in warmth and peace.
In my new era, the choice is yours.
Whether to live in quiet serenity...
or bloody strife.
To dwell in joyous prosperity...
or bitter rivalry.
You can face each other as sworn enemies...
or united as brothers.
For the storm is brewing.
And soon you will discover...
That even in this new era...
one constant remains.
There is always something worth fighting for.
You have chosen to defy peace...
then you have chosen war with a god! (mysterious music) (gentle music) The Midnight Queen is dead.
As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen.
(fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all.
Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop.
(gasp) Could anything be more perfect? I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision.
Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here.
Style should never be a dump stat, darling.
You need this? You probably need this.
(gasp) Could anything be more perfect? It's the little things in life.
This is serioiusly magical.
And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now.
(adventurous music)
-TALIESIN-
Those that rise from the trenches only to boldly dive into the catacombs of the Fairelands are few and far between.
Any investigator, be they soldier or civilian, will eventually find themselves forced to abandon what is right for what must be done.
The scars of war are deep and timeless.
Those who survive must balance on a delicate thread of ever-fraying purpose, for to stare too deeply into the chasm of the past is to see nothing but a reflection of terror.
When retribution crawls from the darkness, our inner fortitude is put to the test.
The Circle of Needle &amp; Thread.
Assignment #533: Eye for an Eye.
(tense mysterious music) (ominous music) Narrator 2: Where were we? Narrator 1 &amp; 3: Utterly doomed Midst.
Narrator 2: Oh, yes, that's right - Narrator 1: We're back! Narrator 2: - Utterly doomed Midst - Narrator 1: Yeah, it's still pretty doomed! Narrator 2: - At pretty much the moment where we last saw it. Well, that's not quite true.
Narrator 1: It's a few hours later.
Narrator 2: Stationary Hill is not looking so hot at the moment.
Narrator 1: Garbage everywhere, flyers for the big sale of Midst strew upon the streets, doors open, broken boxes, crates, carts...
Narrator 2: Abacuses, Welcome-to-the-Trust pamphlets.
Narrator 1: It would be a nice place if it weren't for the colossally vast, quietly howling and increasingly close vast, terrifying, reality-gnawing tsunami of black fog ocean inbound rapidly.
Narrator 3: Oh. that! Narrator 2: Oh, yeah.
Narrator 1: It is a spectacularly terrifying scene.
Listening to this, it may not seem particularly terrifying.
But with the power of your imagination, you too can become very upset.
Narrator 2: With our help.
(epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music)
-MARISHA-
Hey, Critters, it's me, Marisha Ray.
I had exactly a minute and a half of free time today, so I thought I'd make a little unboxing video for y'all unpacking everything you get with a Twitch subscription to Critical Role.
(bright music) (noises of struggle) Okay.
(clicking) Safety third.
(clicking) (ethereal voices laughing)
What the fuck was that? (excited noises) So the first thing we've got here is our live and professionally moderated chat.
Twitch is the only place that you can actually get this.
You know, it's a little strange to hold because it's an amorphous concept, but honestly, you can't deny this craftsmanship.
It's really well made, and-- Ah! Oh, you can post links in this, too! That's really cool, so yeah.
Put that in your chat and click it.
Oh yeah, this is cool.
This is the ability to watch all of Critical Role's VODs immediately after the live broadcast ends and before they're uploaded to YouTube.
Oh, it smells like... ranch? Oh wait.
Oh, no, that's me.
I had ranch on my salad earlier.
Yeah, this smells like nothing.
Oh, oh, here we have (grunts) gift subscriptions, which you can either give to a fellow Critter by name or at random using a fancy Twitch algorithm.
You can give away a lot of subs with this, which I guess is why it's so heavy for something that's technically non-tangible with a value that's deeply subjective to the consumer.
Oh, sick, yeah, I'm so excited to show y'all this part.
With a Twitch subscription to Critical Role, you can use all of our incredible custom emotes in chat.
We have so many emotes in here.
Let's see, we have, oh, Art Dad, super cool.
We got Ashley Hype, fun one.
Oh, look at Trinket here, he's so-- Oh, oh god.
(clattering and crashing) Oh god.
(glass breaking) Uh, uh, ah! Broom, broom.
Hang on, I can fix this.
I can fix this.
I'm fixing it! Jerry! Oh god, okay.
I'm sorry, Trinket.
(machine whirring) Yeah, that'll work.
(gasping) I need more glue, this is not going to be enough.
(tape stretching) Don't tell Rachel, okay? Okay, please nobody-- (crashing) (clattering) Schapiro, will you cut all this out? (electronic buzzing)
-MATT-
Welcome back.
As you all look around, the mist still gathering at the base of the cold front that is the ghost ship itself, the Crimson Abyss sitting here beach side as the rest of the skeletal crew slowly gathers to clamber back onboard.
The captain still holds the hand out, gathering the crew.
What are the rest of you doing?
-TALIESIN-
I'm gathering--
-MARISHA-
I wave to everybody from the boat.
We're friends now! We're going to go for a little ride!
-TALIESIN-
See? Everything's fine.
-SAM-
That's great.
-ASHLEY-
I'm sorry.
-SAM-
No, I'm sorry.
I was snippy with you, and that was uncalled for.
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no.
I was just--
-SAM-
You saved my life twice.
-ASHLEY-
Well--
-SAM-
Thank you.
-ASHLEY-
You're welcome.
You have this thing here in this realm called "guilt," and I really felt it.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Well, you shouldn't.
-MARISHA-
They don't have that in the Fey Realm?
-ASHLEY-
Maybe, I've just never really felt it before, but I feel really strongly here for some reason.
-LAURA-
Sorry.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, it sucks.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Because you make a decision to do something, and then you feel bad in here.
-MARISHA-
There are consequences? Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, consequences.
Consequences.
-TRAVIS-
Boo.
-ASHLEY-
That's what it's called.
Anyway, get on your wheel. Let's go.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Can you swim?
-SAM-
I don't know.
I have a propeller attachment.
I'll use it as a motorboat.
-MATT-
(motor whirring)
-TALIESIN-
I thought you hold it and put it--
-LIAM-
Plus those little wooden flat feet could be like flippers.
-SAM-
Sure, that's a good combo.
-MATT-
That's valid.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to grab the hole and the boots.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Steamboat.
-MATT-
You all manage to climb back onboard as the crew begins to right itself, gather their materials, weapons recovered.
The sniper that had been knocked to the ground The sniper that had been knocked to the ground and had its crossbow taken, its crossbow is retrieved by one of the other crew members as they clamber onboard and hand it to her.
The way they hand it to her, you can see that this female smoldering skeleton you can see that this female smoldering skeleton holds some station within the crew.
You can also, now that you're up close and personal, you can see that there's the blue flame flickering in one socket.
The other is just dark and vacant.
-LIAM-
The sniper, that is?
-MATT-
The sniper, yeah.
The human one with the bush of black hair that had the shrill scream that you were combating with awhile begins to shout out commands to the rest of the crew.
"Gather up! We're shoving off!" Begins to put their finger in the air as the captain still looks at the blade, makeshift belt loops it around the side, and now has both the saber at one side and the massive sword at the other, which almost drags across the deck of the ship.
Looks over and addresses the rest of you, waiting for you all to gather up towards the top of the deck, the poop deck, if you will, where it wants to address.
-MARISHA-
(laughs awkwardly)
-MATT-
"So--"
-MARISHA-
(laughs awkwardly)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Who are you and where are you going?"
-MARISHA-
Oh, well, you see, we're Bells Hells, and we're sort of, you know, we're like pirates ourselves, you know?
-MATT-
"Right."
-MARISHA-
Yes, we've stolen.
We've stolen crawlers and we've stolen airships.
-SAM-
That's true.
-MARISHA-
We were actually gifted an airship, but we--
-LAURA-
We crashed the shit out of it.
-MARISHA-
We crashed it!
-TALIESIN-
Directly into the face of one of our enemies.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, right in the face.
-MARISHA-
Yes. So, you know.
-MATT-
"Congratulations."
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
"I'm Captain Novos.
This is my vessel.
This--" and they address over to the second in command and says, "this is First Mate Woedders."
-LIAM-
Wilders?
-MATT-
Woedders.
-LIAM-
Woedders.
-TRAVIS-
Woedders.
-SAM-
Woedders.
-MATT-
Points to the smoldering skeleton.
"That's our navigator, Cyrillia."
-MARISHA-
Cyrillia.
-TRAVIS-
Cyrillia.
-MATT-
The first mate, Woedders, speaks.
"And this is the rest of our crew! Jamal, Odo, Peters, Bruda, Vendallo, the Whitts Twins, Carmilla, Sanjay, and-- Keith?"
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) One skeleton in the back goes, "I've been with you for a hundred years!"
-MATT-
"It's Kyle!" (laughter)
-LIAM-
Is that the little guy?
-MATT-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Kyle! (laughs)
-LIAM-
What kind of vibe or attention are we getting from the crew, by the way?
-MATT-
A bunch of slightly impatient skeletons are curled around.
They're not aggressive at the moment.
They seem to be very much tethered to the energy of the captain, and you get the sense that the captain is the central point of power that tethers is the central point of power that tethers the entirety of this crew and the ship's existence.
-SAM-
Mm.
-MATT-
So, they seem to almost be in an idle holding pattern they seem to almost be in an idle holding pattern until the captain gives some sort of directive or through the first mate insinuates an interest.
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) We're looking for passage across these waters beyond the Vermilion Reef to the island of Kalutha.
-SAM-
Do you need to be a wolf still?
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) Yeah.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) I don't trust these motherfuckers.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(deeply) They're real stabby.
-MATT-
"Kalutha? That can be done.
Well, a deal was made.
Where's the rest of it?"
-MARISHA-
Oh, I thought you said you were going to deliver us first, and then you get your compass.
-MATT-
"Blade first."
-SAM-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I thought he already gave you the blade.
-MATT-
"And then compass after."
-MARISHA-
That's what you said.
-MATT-
"Aye."
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Pirate negotiations! It's the best.
-SAM-
After we get there?
-MARISHA-
After we get there.
-MATT-
"No."
-SAM-
Oh, after the blade!
-MATT-
"Aye."
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's--
-SAM-
That's new.
-MARISHA-
Mm, that's not fair! That's semantics!
-MATT-
"You also know that I'm bound by my word."
-SAM-
Oh!
-MARISHA-
Wait, how do I know that?
-MATT-
He looks you up and down.
"Maybe you haven't done your true research, then.
Mm. Well."
-LAURA-
What?
-MATT-
"You're welcome to step off the boat."
-SAM-
We haven't done research.
-MATT-
"I'll take both."
-TRAVIS-
We haven't done the true research.
-MARISHA-
True research.
Honestly, we sort of-- We didn't really do any research.
We just heard about you from another woman and went like, that sounds great, and then-- (clicks tongue)
-SAM-
You're bound by your word? Mystically, magically?
-MATT-
"Well, when a deal is made."
-ASHLEY-
What would happen if you-- Hi. What would happen if you break it?
-MATT-
"I don't."
-ASHLEY-
I know, but I'm just saying like a for instance.
You say you're going to do something, and then you don't do it, do you die more?
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"I don't." The eyes-- (flames ignite)
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah, okay.
-MARISHA-
Well, how do we--
-SAM-
I have pretty good insight.
Am I--
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Make an insight check.
-SAM-
Okay.
-SAM-
Insight.
21.
I get a whisper! Someone else plug something.
-ASHLEY-
WizKids! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Nice! That was good!
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
You guys, check out the Mortal Kombat one-shot.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Also, Chapter Two of Candela.
-MARISHA-
(gasps) Candela, yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah.
-TALIESIN-
You can do all these things.
-LAURA-
Cheez Whiz is pretty good.
-SAM-
Matt's mouth right next to your ear is so nice.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
(laughter) It's so warm.
-LIAM-
Like ASMR?
-SAM-
You get that every night?
-MARISHA-
Are you-- Is this unlocking something in you?
-SAM-
Oh my god! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
You like whispers?
-SAM-
Oh! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, shiver me timbers!
-TALIESIN-
New ASMR channel.
-MARISHA-
Is this the beginning of our throuple? (laughter)
-MATT-
Wow, Sam's been rolling insight--
-SAM-
I don't need you.
-MATT-
-- a lot this episode! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Insight check! (desperately) Insight check! (laughter)
-SAM-
I don't need redheads.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-LAURA-
Oh my god! Samuel!
-MARISHA-
I'll take that as a compliment to Q.
(laughs)
-SAM-
That's right.
-MATT-
"So.
Either I get the rest of the deal we made and we're all on our way, or we'll leave you here and take what's ours, anyway."
-SAM-
I think we can trust him. At least on this part.
-MARISHA-
(uncertainly) Hmm.
Okay, well, I just want to say I feel like you duped me a little bit with trying to swap the order and sort of just saying words when clearly my interpretation was, I'll give you the sword, and then we get there, and then you get the compass.
But!
-SAM-
You just want him to note that you're upset?
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-SAM-
Okay. (laughs)
-MATT-
"Consider it a hard lesson about parleying on the sea."
-MARISHA-
Feels more like a hard lesson just about you, but that's fair.
At least shake on it.
-SAM-
Ew.
-MATT-
(dry cracking) Bony fingers curl around your bony fingers.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
(laughs) Cold, clammy flesh meets somewhat damp, frozen bone.
-TRAVIS-
Bone-off.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
Bone on bone.
-MATT-
He holds there for a second.
-SAM-
(laughs) The Marisha Ray story.
-LAURA-
What's sexier than bone on bone? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
We've gone bone on bone in this beach-off.
-MATT-
The rest of you hear squeaking, almost like--
-TRAVIS-
Tendon.
-LAURA-
Clickety-clacks.
-MATT-
Like cold metal pushing against concrete.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Ugh.
-ASHLEY-
(shudders)
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Chalk.
-TRAVIS-
(rusty squeaking)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(creaking)
-MATT-
"Now."
-MARISHA-
My eyes flare a little as well, just to meet his.
-MATT-
"Give me my compass!"
"Give me my compass!"
-MARISHA-
I pull him close to me.
-MATT-
(growls)
-MARISHA-
(growls)
-MATT-
(snarls)
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy.
-MARISHA-
Fine!
-MATT-
(growls)
-MARISHA-
(growls)
-MATT-
(growls)
-MARISHA-
(growls) Chetney!
-TRAVIS-
(screams) I shrivel back down.
(laughter)
(hyperventilating) (clear throat)
-TRAVIS-
(chokes) Okay, okay.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Oh no.
-TRAVIS-
I take out the compass.
Wait, where's the wooden one? Where's my replica? Thanks.
It's pretty good, don't you think? You sure you don't want--
-ASHLEY-
Which one is it?
-MARISHA-
Give him validation.
-MATT-
The dark, smoldering skeleton has walked up behind and snatches the wooden one from your hand and goes--
-TRAVIS-
Ah, ah--
-MATT-
Looking at it with the one burning blue eye and goes, "It's made quite well, Captain." (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Thank you!
-MATT-
"The craftsmanship is second to none."
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Your first mate--
-MATT-
"Might I take it as a prize?"
-TRAVIS-
Excuse me?
-ASHLEY-
Wait, whoa. That wasn't part of the deal.
-TRAVIS-
I didn't sign it, so it's practically worthless.
-LAURA-
They're pirates. That's what they do.
-LIAM-
Are we still parked, by the way?
-MATT-
At the moment, yeah, still parked.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
How did you lose your compass?
-LIAM-
Multipass.
-MATT-
The captain folds his arms.
"We were-- We were known in these parts for being successful at our privateering business.
The downside is, you tend to make a few enemies.
When all your enemies become friends, sometimes it doesn't end well.
But we decided, maybe we weren't done.
So here we are, and we've almost found them all." "So here we are, and we've almost found them all."
-LAURA-
What happens when you find them all?
-MATT-
"I guess we'll find out."
-SAM-
What else are you missing, treasure-wise?
-MATT-
"The money's not too bad." You can see, now you're close up, the bony grin of the captain.
It looks like it's a pale gray bone, but upon closer glance, you can see they're platinum-coated teeth on the inside of this blackened, old, withered bone grin.
-MARISHA-
That's cool.
-TALIESIN-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
He's got a platinum grill? That's sick.
-MATT-
Yeah, basically.
-TALIESIN-
Into it.
-MATT-
"The money, not so much.
But there are things that are personal to me.
Items, keepsakes, trophies, and my navigation tools are quite a collection."
-TRAVIS-
I agree.
If you ever wanted to trade up in terms of craftsmanship, you could let me know.
-MATT-
Grabs it, and as he pulls it away from you, you can feel this audible sigh of joy across the entire crew and the captain.
(satisfied sigh)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Yep, yep.
-MARISHA-
Sorry, it's still so fresh in my head.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
We literally could've done this 20 minutes before without beating the entire crew into the fucking water fives times.
-TRAVIS-
That's fair.
-TALIESIN-
That's fine, it's fine.
-MARISHA-
It took me like three minutes to walk to the damn boat.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Welcome to the Crimson Abyss.
Find what quarters aren't taken.
We've got three days' travel to your island."
-MARISHA-
Three days.
-TRAVIS-
Three days on a ghost ship? Holy shit.
-MARISHA-
This is going to be cool.
-LAURA-
What guarantee do we have that y'all aren't going to attack us as soon as we make land?
-MATT-
"My word."
-SAM-
Is there any, not for me, but is there any food and water on this ship for my friends here?
-MATT-
"Oh yeah, we have a ghost chef with a bunch of ghost rolls and ghost mice.
No, we don't have food! We're fucking dead!"
-TALIESIN-
We have stuff in the hole.
-TRAVIS-
We have some rations.
-TALIESIN-
We're all right.
And whatever you're cooking.
-ASHLEY-
He can bake.
-SAM-
I can bake a little, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
We can catch some fish.
-SAM-
Oh, we can go fishing.
Do you guys have fishing rods and bait?
-MATT-
"No."
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
Nets, perhaps? Or something to--
-MATT-
"No."
-SAM-
-- trawl the-- All right.
-LAURA-
I think we could probably find a way to catch some fish.
-TRAVIS-
Standing this close to him, can I use my Hunter's Bane to get a closer look at, besides the eyes, any areas that are radiating any significance in his existence?
-MATT-
Sure, go ahead and I'd say roll investigation or insight.
Your choice.
-TRAVIS-
I'll do investigation.
-MATT-
You can have advantage on this because of your Hunter's Bane.
-TRAVIS-
19.
-MATT-
19.
Within what bit of the coat you can see, there's that fierce, burning, blue light in each eye.
It tends to flare with points that he's making as he speaks.
You see within the shadow of the chest, glancing inside, there's a dull blue glow in the ribcage that almost pulses, not like a heartbeat because it's too slow, but it looks like there's metal in there, too.
It looks like there is almost chains that are wrapped around this weird source of light within the chest.
-TRAVIS-
Very cool.
-LIAM-
The ship appears to just be an old, ancient wooden ship? Is there anything unnatural about--
-MATT-
The ship itself, the wood looks weathered.
It looks like this boat would not be seaworthy.
You can see holes in the hull.
There is an odd pale moss and mold that's grown in places that seeps into every corner where the wood meets metal.
The damage that you dealt to the deck of the ship looks like it's repaired itself slightly, but even the repairs bring it to a state of decent (laughs) disrepair.
The sails themselves seem to blow with the wind and don't help, but the ship seems to have a will and a thrust of its own, and as now you've made the deal, the ship begins to pull away from the island of Slival.
You can see the mist that billows out in front of it, obscuring the path before you, and yet the one who was introduced to you as the navigator, Cyrillia, the sniper with the one burning eye, has clambered back up to one of the crow's nests and produces a spyglass, but seems to look into the mist like it has no obscuration.
As the ship begins to push outwards to the ocean and take you on the first leg of your journey, the rest of the crew begins to go about their business back under deck.
The captain stands, looking over the edge, taking the seven of you in for a bit.
"Not going to lie, maybe it'll be nice to have some new blood, or really even any blood on the ship for a bit.
Make friends, stay comfy.
Nap, if you want to."
-SAM-
If we're going to be here for a couple days, do you need any repairs on the ship? I mean, should we spruce this place up? Make it look homey or colorful?
-MATT-
"We like it how it is."
-SAM-
What will you get out of this? Is that what you said?
-LIAM-
He likes it how it is.
-MATT-
"We like it how it is."
-SAM-
Oh, how it is. Okay.
-MATT-
"You all aren't from around here, are you?
-SAM-
Your ghost accent--
-LIAM-
Is there anywhere--
-MARISHA-
It's so thick.
-LIAM-
Is there anywhere we're not supposed to go, or do we have free reign to walk the levels of the boat, Captain?
-TRAVIS-
Good question.
-MATT-
"You can walk where you want on the level right below deck.
My quarters are off limits."
-ASHLEY-
Where are your quarters?
-ASHLEY-
I am just--
-TALIESIN-
Already?
-ASHLEY-
Calm down, calm down! I'm just getting the lay of the boat.
Lay of the land.
-LIAM-
Lay of the captain?
-MATT-
"The only double doors on the ship."
-ASHLEY-
Say again?
-MATT-
"They're the only double doors on the ship."
-ASHLEY-
The only double doors.
-MARISHA-
Three days of asking him what he said.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Over and over again.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
We'll make it two.
-ASHLEY-
I'm so sorry.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!" (laughter)
-LIAM-
Enunciation is largely about the tongue and lips, and they're gone.
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
So he's mostly just skeleton?
-MATT-
Yeah, in fact, most of the crew is pretty much straight skeletal with little shreds of wispy, dried skin in some places with little shreds of wispy, dried skin in some places and hair that's tattered and dangling.
-TRAVIS-
Make yourself comfortable.
(laughter)
(mumbled pirate gibberish) (laughter)
-MATT-
That one.
-ASHLEY-
When did you pass? For real?
-TRAVIS-
Gas?
-MATT-
"Decades ago.
Who can keep count? It's been more fun since I have."
-MARISHA-
So you truly do love this life of undeath.
-MATT-
"For now. You know, variety is the spice of life.
One day, maybe we'll get bored of it.
Maybe by the time I find everything that's ours."
-MARISHA-
Now that you have your compass, where does it point to?
-MATT-
"That wasn't part of our deal."
-MARISHA-
Oh, what's wrong? You scared?
-MATT-
"No, I'm just private."
-MARISHA-
(groans)
-ASHLEY-
(laughs) (groans like Marisha)
-TALIESIN-
I can't believe no one's actually said this.
Do you know what the fuck is going on out there, by the way, with everywhere right now? Have you noticed any of the crazy fucking shit that's going on? Has it affected your shit, what's going on right now?
-MATT-
"I have no idea what you're talking about."
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit!
-MARISHA-
You mentioned that you're bound to the Strife Emperor?
-MATT-
"Aye."
-SAM-
Who dat?
-MARISHA-
Yes, who is that? Is he a god?
-MATT-
"Some would call him a god. He's kind of a guiding persona in the pantheon for those who like to get what they want, take what they want."
-MARISHA-
Thematic.
-TALIESIN-
Been a little distant lately?
-SAM-
Do we know who that is?
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Do any of us know Strife Emperor?
-MATT-
Make a religion check, if you'd like.
-SAM-
How do I have a negative one to religion?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, you just discovered it.
-MATT-
That's true.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Like a week ago.
-MATT-
What'd you get?
-TRAVIS-
21.
-LAURA-
15.
-MATT-
15?
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-MATT-
Strife Emperor is definitely one of the Betrayer Gods in the pantheon.
They are largely a god of tyranny, of conquest.
They would sit in the realm of lawful evil.
They believe in structure through domination.
Those that are in power are there because they deserve it or have earned it by showing their strength, and those who should be bent were made to kneel before them.
That's the gist of it.
You're uncertain what the detailed influence in this realm is.
You have very little personal experience or knowledge of the Shattered Teeth.
But you get the sense in the way he talks about the Strife Emperor, it's less about reverie and worship and more like, "Eh.
If you've got to pray to something in dark moments, let it be someone I can agree with."
-TRAVIS-
Well...
-TALIESIN-
That might not be an issue for that long.
-MARISHA-
All the gods are a bit under threat at the moment.
I don't know if you've felt it.
-MATT-
"Been a bit busy."
-LIAM-
You bound to these waters around the islands?
-MATT-
"For now."
-LAURA-
That's what you're going to get out of all your objects? Freedom?
-MATT-
"Maybe."
-TALIESIN-
What happens if your god disappears?
-MATT-
"I don't know."
-TALIESIN-
That'll be an interesting day.
-TRAVIS-
You know, what we're good at is finding things.
Got quite the nose on us, some of us do.
So if you have any of these other missing items that, I don't know, are on <i>land</i>, we could be persuaded to perhaps sniff them out.
we could be persuaded to perhaps sniff them out.
-TALIESIN-
You're not getting your sword back.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking, don't cut me off at the knees!
-TALIESIN-
(cackles)
-SAM-
He's right, we're really good at finding stuff.
-MATT-
"So am I, obviously."
-ASHLEY-
Well...
-LAURA-
We sort of helped.
-MARISHA-
We called you.
-LAURA-
We stuck it in the water.
-MARISHA-
We literally went like, bloop!
-MATT-
"Right, and I found you when you did.
It was really fast.
We were right there."
-TRAVIS-
The response time was incredible, truly.
-LAURA-
Seriously, how'd you get here so fast?
-MATT-
"It's part of the deal.
I don't fully understand it, but, you know, we're not going to question it."
-ASHLEY-
How many more pieces are left? Did you already cover this?
-SAM-
He didn't say a number.
-TRAVIS-
He's (pirate voice) <i>private</i>.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, you're private?
-MATT-
"There's been enough questions for a bit.
Nice to meet you, Bells Hells.
Make yourselves comfortable.
If it gets a bit chilly, sorry. Just how it is here.
Anyway.
I'm going to go below deck, take some time to contemplate."
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
He pulls the blade out, looks at it for a bit.
"I know, I know. Let's talk."
-TRAVIS-
Huh? What?
-SAM-
Chetney!
-TALIESIN-
I think all of these were very good decisions.
-SAM-
Are you okay giving up that blade?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, no!
-MARISHA-
Sorry, Chetney.
-TRAVIS-
I feel like we struck up a rapport.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what?
-TRAVIS-
I feel like we have struck up a rapport as a group, and so it was my duty, my duty, to exchange something of great value for our shared goals.
-SAM-
Seemed like you really liked that sword.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, it was a-- Yep!
-SAM-
You're not feeling anything strange in your body after giving it up? You're not hurt psychically, or--?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, I'm a little fucked up.
-SAM-
Oh, I can give you some healing.
-TRAVIS-
I'm a little weak.
It's a little chilly.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I don't know if you wanted to cook up some--
-LIAM-
Are they paying much attention to us right now?
-TALIESIN-
I assume we're short resting at this point.
-MATT-
Not at the moment. Some of them are looking out.
Most of them are below deck, and there's three, and the first mate, and the navigator.
-LIAM-
The captain's gone.
-MATT-
Cyrillia is still up there.
The captain has gone below deck.
It's just the first mate and three other crew members.
-LIAM-
I'm sorry, with the captain gone, they're about their duties?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Just a reminder, we also have the reef moss balm.
We have two of those.
We have the slickshimmer oil and the vial of cleansing flame, which if you haven't looked at that, holy shit.
-MARISHA-
That's the one where it gets rid of maladies or something?
-TRAVIS-
Kind of.
You've got to fuck yourself up to get rid of it.
It's pretty dumb.
It's a cool item.
-TALIESIN-
We have these weird motherfucking boots.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah, what do the boots do?
-TRAVIS-
We don't know.
-TALIESIN-
Go on your feet? I'm not sure.
-SAM-
I don't know that I can Identify them.
-TALIESIN-
We'll do it tomorrow.
-SAM-
No, I mean, I don't know that I can.
-LAURA-
What do you mean?
-SAM-
Well--
-LAURA-
You've always been able to do that.
-SAM-
I know but, you know, there's three attunement slots, and I've got your staff attuned now.
-LAURA-
Why? Just un-attune to it.
You don't need it right now.
-SAM-
Okay, but what if we need to teleport somewhere or something?
-LAURA-
In the next three days?
-SAM-
What if all these pirates attack us?
-LAURA-
We're not going to be able to teleport.
Well, shit's weird here in the Shattered Teeth.
I don't think we're going to be able to teleport.
-LIAM-
How long does it take to zero in? An hour or so?
-SAM-
I guess I can just attune and attune.
-LIAM-
We got nothing else to do on this boat.
-SAM-
Okay.
I'll switch attunement, and I will Identify that thing.
-TRAVIS-
Famous last words.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
I love it.
Ooh!
-LAURA-
He's been waiting! What does it do?
-TALIESIN-
♪ I've been ♪
-TRAVIS-
♪ Waiting ♪
-SAM-
They're just Boots of Speed. Just Boots of Speed.
Bonus action, click those boots. Liam knows this well.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, <i>just</i> Boots of Speed?
-LAURA-
They're not Boots of Haste.
-MATT-
No.
-SAM-
Oh, Boots of Speed.
"You can use a bonus action to click your boots together.
If you do, the boots double your walking speed.
Any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage.
If you click your heels together again, you end this effect.
When the boots' property's been used for 10 minutes, that's it for the day."
-TRAVIS-
10 minutes, you can double your speed?
-LAURA-
That needs to go to somebody that does not have a good distance.
-SAM-
It requires attunement.
-MARISHA-
Or one of the fighters.
I'm good.
-SAM-
Ashton needs to get up close and personal in battle.
-TALIESIN-
Oh man.
-TRAVIS-
I don't know if you saw that last fight.
-LAURA-
You have good teleporting abilities, though.
-TRAVIS-
He was fucking hopscotching all over the place.
-LAURA-
You're able to jump around.
-TALIESIN-
Sometimes.
-ASHLEY-
With that, he would be--
-TRAVIS-
Bamfing all over the place.
-TALIESIN-
And sometimes--
-MARISHA-
Sometimes.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, there are terrible things I could do with that.
-LIAM-
What about you? What about a speed wolf?
-SAM-
Oh yeah, speed wolf's not a bad idea.
-LAURA-
That's the thing, Chet's kind of limited, and he can't ever teleport.
-TRAVIS-
I only got 35 feet.
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-LIAM-
His legs are the shortest of all.
-SAM-
Can you do Misty Step or anything?
-TRAVIS-
Nope.
-SAM-
What about you? You can fly and stuff, can't you?
-LIAM-
She's got her leap.
-TALIESIN-
Turn into a bird.
-ASHLEY-
I can do anything I want.
I have a 35 walking speed.
I think somebody else--
-SAM-
Orym, no, not you?
-LIAM-
I lived that life.
-LAURA-
Yeah, he's fast.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
He's fast fast.
-LIAM-
I love my flea boots.
I'm very partial to them.
-SAM-
It's up to you two.
-TRAVIS-
I just lost my third.
Bye, Graz'tchar.
-LAURA-
Oh...
-SAM-
Ashton?
-LIAM-
I mean, don't give up.
-SAM-
Chetney?
-LIAM-
You got three days to figure that problem out.
-LAURA-
Rollies for it? Arm wrestle?
-TALIESIN-
Want to Rollies for it?
-TRAVIS-
Sure!
-TALIESIN-
Into it.
-SAM-
Oh shit, this is a high stakes Rollies.
-ASHLEY-
This is high stakes.
-MATT-
Best two out of three, or a single roll?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, two out of three?
-TALIESIN-
Two at the same time?
-MARISHA-
Two out of three.
-TRAVIS-
Singles for drama.
-LIAM-
Prolonged pleasure.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-TALIESIN-
17.
(oohing)
Second one, second one.
New die, new die.
-SAM-
One Rollies down.
-TALIESIN-
What's the hammer mean?
-LAURA-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Wow!
-SAM-
What a dick.
I love it.
-ASHLEY-
All right, all right.
-TRAVIS-
I know when I'm beat.
I know when I'm beat.
-TALIESIN-
If we find more stuff, we can chat.
-TRAVIS-
I'll just sit over here with my walker.
-SAM-
Well, hey!
-TALIESIN-
You're just bleeding everywhere.
-TRAVIS-
I know!
-SAM-
Chetney, do you want the Staff of Dark Odyssey? Then you can control our teleporting, and it also gives you Misty Step.
-TRAVIS-
Don't you need arcane shit to use it?
-SAM-
I don't know.
-MARISHA-
Well.
-SAM-
It just says, oh, "attunement by a spellcaster." Are you a spellcaster?
-LAURA-
You can cast spells.
-MARISHA-
You can cast spells!
-MATT-
He's not a spellcaster.
-TALIESIN-
Not a spellcaster.
-TRAVIS-
I just have some touch stuff, and Minor Illusion.
-TALIESIN-
Oh my god, this is dark.
-TRAVIS-
Thanks, though.
-TALIESIN-
I am so sorry that I'm taking these.
If we find another object--
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to make some roller blades.
It's going to be awesome.
-SAM-
Wooden roller blades?
-TRAVIS-
Yep! (wood clunking)
-TALIESIN-
This is mean, this is Vax mean. Yeah, no.
-LAURA-
This poor little old man.
You should help the poor little old man.
-TRAVIS-
Give me your hammer, Ashton.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know.
Actually, I'll tell you.
What other shit you got?
-SAM-
Yeah, what are you unattuning to now?
-TALIESIN-
Nothing, I got a free slot.
-SAM-
You had a free slot?
-LAURA-
Oh, you both have free slots?
-SAM-
Oh my god!
-LAURA-
They both had free slots.
-LIAM-
He's got the rod, but that's not attunement.
-ASHLEY-
What if you each wear one boot?
-LIAM-
Ha! I like that.
-SAM-
A really fast circle.
-TALIESIN-
So we have to click them together.
-TRAVIS-
I'm good, I'm good.
I've got a Butcher's Bib.
I've got a scythe, and I got a ring of, you know, don't die.
I'm good.
-TALIESIN-
A Ring of Don't Die?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, Temporal Salvation.
-TALIESIN-
Really?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it's from-- My ex gave it to me.
-TALIESIN-
I thought you were more of a gambling man.
That surprises me.
-TRAVIS-
Not when you see what this thing does.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I was going to say, depending on what you wanted to unattune, we could have a conversation about this.
-TRAVIS-
I have the scythe, the Butcher's Bib, or the Ring of Temporal Salvation.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to look these things up.
We'll have a conversation.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, okay.
-MARISHA-
As we have stated, we have three days, so maybe we can (mutters) get your sword back.
-TRAVIS-
What did you say? You stroked out a little there.
-SAM-
No, she's speaking the same language as the captain.
-MARISHA-
(pirate voice) Maybe we can get your sword back!
-LIAM-
Put your lips back on, Laudna. Put your lips back on.
-TRAVIS-
It's about time that we had one! (laughter)
Footsteps, footsteps, footsteps, footsteps.
-ASHLEY-
What time is it?
-MATT-
Travel for a bit here, it's probably, you stayed overnight, it's mid-afternoon, maybe.
-LIAM-
We have no sun.
-MATT-
It's hard to tell.
-LIAM-
There's nothing to read.
-MATT-
You get the sense it's somewhere in the early afternoon, maybe, mid-afternoon.
-LAURA-
We stayed overnight, we talked to a person in a toad.
-TRAVIS-
It doesn't feel like the marine layer or the haze is caused by the ship or interacting with the ship, it's just moving through the haze.
-MATT-
It's thicker around the ship.
-LAURA-
So there's no way to tell where we are.
-MATT-
You're at the whim of this ship with no concept of what direction you're going or what's nearby.
You have maybe a 50- to 100-foot viewing radius around the ship.
-LAURA-
Does it go all the way up? Is it above, in the--
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah?
-MATT-
It's a tall mist.
-TRAVIS-
Peering over the side, remembering how fucking cold it was right by the ship, is the water interacting strangely, or can we see any aquatic life under the breaks in the water, or as the ship moves?
-MATT-
Yeah, as you glance over, you can see in the water occasionally, there's sea life that, you look down, course through, though the sea life that's there is avoiding the ship.
The few things you see are curving away from it.
It doesn't hold a lot of joy to those denizens of the ocean.
-TRAVIS-
That's cool.
-LAURA-
Cool. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Ooh, I love that noise.
-MATT-
So.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Well.
-LAURA-
Are you going to make a deal? You look like you're about to make a deal.
-TRAVIS-
Huh?!
-TALIESIN-
What were you going to unattune?
-TRAVIS-
Take your pick.
I'm an open market.
-TALIESIN-
Ring for the boots?
-TRAVIS-
You want the ring?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, it's the only thing that-- vaguely interests me.
-TRAVIS-
You got it.
-TALIESIN-
That bib is so fucking ugly.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
It really is.
It's terrible.
-TALIESIN-
It's just disgusting.
-TRAVIS-
(gasps)
-TALIESIN-
I have nice clothes.
-TRAVIS-
Ashton, I'm so touched!
-TALIESIN-
All right, well, thanks to the ring, I can pull them off of your dead body eventually.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
So, you know, it's just a loan.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Don't tell my bae.
-TALIESIN-
Never.
-LIAM-
Just got to find you some wings now.
-TRAVIS-
That'd be fun.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah. Where's-- Yeah, so Cyrillia is still up in the crow's nest, right?
-MATT-
Yeah.
But you can climb if you want to address them.
-TALIESIN-
I may climb.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
If you're going to go talk to the navigator, maybe get us a map or look at their map and see if you can sort of remember.
-TALIESIN-
They don't have a map.
-SAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
They're ghosts.
-SAM-
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, in general they have nothing.
They want nothing.
-TRAVIS-
In general.
-TALIESIN-
They need nothing.
I mean, they're ghosts.
I can't believe this is actually a real ship.
I'm a little concerned that we're not falling through the floor.
-MARISHA-
It is odd.
-TALIESIN-
It is, isn't it?
-MARISHA-
Hmm.
-LAURA-
Maybe this is one of the items he got back.
-SAM-
Hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh.
-LIAM-
Anyone want to look in the dark and scary inside?
-SAM-
We're going to have to at some point.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Kind of do.
-ASHLEY-
We should go see if there's any empty quarters.
-TALIESIN-
Well, we got to sleep somewhere, don't we?
-LIAM-
Right, got to figure that out.
-TALIESIN-
Hmm.
-LAURA-
It's probably going to be colder below deck.
What do you think?
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
That's a good question.
-LIAM-
Only one way to find out.
-LAURA-
♪ (cheerful humming) ♪
-MARISHA-
Come on! Imogen, come with me.
Okay.
-MATT-
All right.
What are you doing?
-TALIESIN-
Well--
-MATT-
Were you doing anything?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to up the-- I was trying to remember the name of the ring really quickly.
-MATT-
Ring of Temporal Salvation.
-TALIESIN-
Temporal, okay.
Yeah, I'm going to go up to the crow's nest.
-LAURA-
You're going to get so much shit from Aabria.
-TRAVIS-
This is awesome.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
You climb up the mast, past the tattered sails to the upper level where Cyrillia is currently perched and glancing over, seemingly lost in thought.
Then hearing you approach, they quickly, (throat clear) spy glass out, looking off in the distance, almost not paying you any mind.
-TALIESIN-
Hey!
-MATT-
"(grunt of acknowledgement)"
-TALIESIN-
I tap the eyes.
How'd you get yours?
-MATT-
"Carved out.
-TALIESIN-
Hm.
-TRAVIS-
(mouthed) Carved out?!
-TALIESIN-
Lose a bet?
-MATT-
"No, I was making a point."
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-TALIESIN-
Was the point made?
-MATT-
"I don't need both to be the best navigator."
-TALIESIN-
Point fucking made.
Mine was a window.
I don't think there was really much of a point.
It was a very interesting window.
-MATT-
"Looks like the window came with you."
-TALIESIN-
(laughs) It kind of did.
Well, you know.
These things happen.
-MATT-
"You make do with what you're given."
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I used to think that.
Then one day, pretty recently, I realized that I hadn't been given really very much, and I thought about that and, I don't know, I got real angry.
And I just don't know how to stop feeling that.
-MATT-
"Anger's good."
-TALIESIN-
It is.
-MATT-
"It makes things happen." You watch as the little veins of smoldering light in between the bones flare for a second, embers almost burn off.
You get the sense now, at this close proximity, this is the skeleton of a fire genasi.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-SAM-
Ooh.
-TRAVIS-
Dope.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
This is all an anger trip, really.
Do you ever feel robbed? Like you had a good thing and someone just took it from you?
-MATT-
Looks down towards the ship for a second and then covers quickly.
-TALIESIN-
I pretend I didn't see that.
-MARISHA-
Oh, interesting.
-TALIESIN-
I had my first encounter with a god.
-MATT-
"Lucky you."
-TALIESIN-
Not really.
Confirmed a lot of suspicions I had, which is, I don't know. I used to think they just don't notice and, you know, there's a layer of us that drop below the radar.
Maybe that's true, but I got one to notice, and it didn't like me.
So I'm considering not liking them right back.
-MATT-
"Good.
Fuck 'em."
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I plan to, and we can.
Things are changing out there.
Even whatever creature that cursed this boat may not be long for this world.
The red moon, (sighs) something's going to get released.
No one knows what's going to happen.
-MATT-
You see when you mention the red moon and the navigator gets this odd turn of the skull, like it's putting pieces together.
-TALIESIN-
Can anyone else see past this fog or just you?
-MATT-
"Just me."
-TALIESIN-
So you're the only one who knows what the moon looks like right now.
-MATT-
"I haven't seen it in a long time."
-TALIESIN-
It's up there.
You should look.
-MATT-
"That's why I'm worried."
-TALIESIN-
Wait, you can't see it right now?
-MATT-
"No.
I haven't seen it in weeks.
I haven't said anything."
-TALIESIN-
(exhales) Things are changing, and no one knows which side of the coin is going to land at this point.
-MATT-
"Hmm."
-TALIESIN-
So if I were you, and I only say this because I really have an affinity for people who have fucked up their eyes, I'd think about what you have and what it's worth, and is it worth anything? Then, I don't know, from the feeling I get, you've been here a long time.
I don't really know if you actually know what real anger is.
-MATT-
"You don't know me."
-TALIESIN-
Nah, but I know being fucking angry.
I start heading down.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I learned a lot there.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Hmm.
-MATT-
For those of you going below deck--
-TALIESIN-
Yes!
-MATT-
Indeed, the temperature drops dramatically as you go below deck.
I mean, your breath was already visible, but below, you're immediately. (shivers) It's cold.
You're going to want to bundle up if you have the means of doing so to sleep here with any sort of comfort.
It feels like you're walking through a meat locker.
But as you go below deck, the first thing that catches you is the sound of a violin.
(gasping)
-MARISHA-
It's so creepy.
I love it.
-MATT-
As you pass into this open area, you can see there are some bunks set out and a common area space.
You can see one of the skeleton crew who has a little fiddle that they're in the process of--
-LIAM-
Jaunty?
-MATT-
-- playing with.
Just a gentle, just looking at it.
It's just a little off-key.
They're tuning it as they go.
Some of them are sitting around and having a conversation.
There's a table in the corner.
It looks like a few are playing some games of chance.
You can see on one of the bunks, it's just a pile of bones.
(laughs) (laughter)
One of them took a nap and went (bones scattering).
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
That's the way to call it.
-LIAM-
He rolled a hundred on the d100.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Well, he went in his sleep, so, you know.
-LIAM-
What do you think? Do you think we're going to sleep down here, or--?
-LAURA-
Yeah, it's really fucking cold.
-LIAM-
Or up top where it's warmer?
-MARISHA-
Maybe.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I know.
-MARISHA-
I mean, it seems like this boat can regenerate.
Maybe we can still make a little fire.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
I wonder if it's warmer in the hole by a few degrees.
-MARISHA-
It might be.
-SAM-
That's interesting.
-TRAVIS-
Extra-dimensional space.
-MARISHA-
It's not a bad idea.
-LIAM-
Typically true.
-SAM-
Uh-huh. Yep.
Holes are warm.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
God fucking damn it.
-ASHLEY-
Cozy.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Comforting.
-SAM-
Dark.
-LAURA-
Do they--
-ASHLEY-
Dark.
-LIAM-
Snug.
-LAURA-
Do the skeletons look like they're talking to each other at all? They're just being a normal group?
-MATT-
Yeah, they're just being a normal crew.
I mean, once you walk in, a few of them look over and watch as you enter.
Some of them are quiet, some of them go back to playing their dice games at the table.
Seems like normal crew.
They're just a bunch of skeletons.
-LAURA-
Weird.
-MATT-
In a frozen, you know, space internally.
They have lanterns that hang and sway, but even the light within them is a pale white light as opposed to a warm flame.
-TRAVIS-
Could I go over to one of them, just enjoy the music, and say: Oh, you guys look like a tight-knit crew.
What does the captain like? What are his passions?
-MATT-
The fiddling stops.
(laughs) Most everyone turns and looks to you in the silence.
One of them that you saw was pointed out as Bruda, who you can see is a feminine skeleton in presentation, with a jet black scarf that's tied around the skull and two gold rings that are embedded in the bone around where the nose would be.
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
Dang!
-MATT-
Leans forward.
"The captain is looking for his things.
The captain is looking for his things.
That's what he likes."
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.
I just didn't know if he might appreciate a thank you for the lift, but looking for his things.
-MATT-
"He likes manners, yeah."
-TRAVIS-
Manners?
-MATT-
"Good manners."
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
Thank you for that information.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"You're welcome."
-ASHLEY-
Wait, where are you all from? Because you have a very thick-- You all have the same--
-TRAVIS-
All over, or--?
-ASHLEY-
-- kind of an accent.
-MATT-
They look each other and another one of them leans forward.
"We're a bit smattered around from Wildemount and some of these islands.
We sort of came together as a crew over time, but yeah.
Well, some days it's hard to remember where we came from."
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-LIAM-
What's the deal with the witch twins? What's the their story?
-MATT-
You look over at the Whitts twins and--
-SAM-
This Whitts twins?
-MARISHA-
Witch twins.
-LIAM-
The witch twins.
-MATT-
No, Whitts.
-LIAM-
Oh, Whitts! I thought it was witch.
Okay.
-MATT-
Sorry no. The Whitts twins.
They are these two halfling skeletons that are currently in the process-- They are two of the four at the gaming table that have-- You look at the table and there's gold coins, there's piles of teeth, there's, you know, wooden shaved dowels with letters burnt into them.
There's a collection of buttons, just whatever random things could be used as ante for different games over and over and over again that don't really serve any monetary purpose beyond just going through the motions of what they did in life.
But the two Whitts twins are these nearly identical halfling skeletons that both have one hand between the two of them of cards that are glancing over, looking at the cards and then looking back and trying to listen in to the conversation and such.
-LAURA-
Don't y'all ever get bored?
-MATT-
There's a stagnant pause and they all look at each other.
There's a resounding unified, "No! (echoing)"
-LIAM-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
I mean, you're playing with buttons and pebbles.
It seems a little unfair to not have at least a little coin.
The captain doesn't share?
-MATT-
They all look at each other.
"(laughs)" They all start laughing at once.
The first one that you were talking to, Bruda, goes, "Oh, the Captain shares."
-MARISHA-
Oh?
-MATT-
"The captain's very generous."
-MARISHA-
What does he share?
-MATT-
"Whatever we take that's not part of his initial belongings."
-MARISHA-
Like buttons?
-MATT-
There's almost a frustrated resignation to the response.
An immediate wave of disinterest comes over them.
"Look."
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"We're not used to having guests, so I apologize if we're a little awkward."
-TRAVIS-
No, no, no, this is good.
-ASHLEY-
No, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
This is very homey.
-MARISHA-
This is great.
-LAURA-
We're always a little awkward.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, we are.
-SAM-
We don't mean to sound judgmental.
I think this is great.
You guys have a little life down here.
-LIAM-
It's our first time on a ghost ship.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"We've killed a lot of people."
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy. Yeah.
-MATT-
"Hard to make friends."
-TRAVIS-
Are there other ghost ships on the high seas, or any--
-LIAM-
Competition?
-TRAVIS-
-- natural enemies you might have?
-SAM-
Oh yeah.
Or do sea beasts attack you ever?
-LAURA-
I was wondering about that, too.
-TRAVIS-
Because we will fuck them up! We will throw down! Sorry.
-MATT-
"Sea beasts don't bother us, and we've not met another ghost ship, though I've heard tales that they're out there.
Maybe we could." Another one sits up.
He was the one who was pointed out as Jamal earlier, and goes, "I'd like to meet others.
That'd be fun."
-MARISHA-
Oh! It must be so lonely.
-TRAVIS-
Is that Kyle? (laughs)
-MATT-
No, that's Jamal.
-TRAVIS-
Oh okay.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Jamal or Shamal?
-MATT-
Jamal.
-MARISHA-
Jamal.
-TRAVIS-
Shamal? Is that necessary?
-LAURA-
Did you say Jamal or Schmal? (laughter)
-MATT-
This is the schmal schkeleton.
(laughter)
Schnap out of it! All right.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Orym's inched his way over to the violinist.
It's really good.
-MATT-
This is the skeleton who's introduced as Sanjay.
-LIAM-
Sanjay.
-MATT-
Who has human or elven features, or perhaps half-elven, hard to tell.
A bleached, white skull that you can see has etchings around where some of the features might be.
It looks beautiful, almost like a henna carving into the skull in places that decorate it, and has a piece of straw that hangs out of the mouth, that is bent in the middle and hangs, and is tuning the violin.
-LIAM-
Did you play when you were alive?
-MATT-
"That's true."
-LIAM-
Oh.
Do you take requests?
-MATT-
"I've never taken a request, ever."
-LIAM-
First time?
-MATT-
"What are you requesting?"
-LIAM-
Have you ever heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
-MATT-
"Who hasn't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? (scoffs)"
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
I would take "Beads of Love."
-LIAM-
If you know it.
-MATT-
"I-I-I've never tried to play it on a violin, but I'll give it a shot."
-MARISHA-
He's wearing a Scanlan reunion tour t-shirt.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I didn't even notice.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, you're <i>that</i> guy.
-LIAM-
What? The best character in the history of Critical Role?
-TRAVIS-
♪ Gotta pull my motherfucking ♪ Carved into his clavicle.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs)
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
It takes a minute for Sanjay to get into it, but then it becomes this gentle, airy, fun rendition, it's kind of like "Beads of Love," you can hear the melody in it, but, also, it doesn't quite have the same energy from what you've experienced before, but it's not bad.
-TALIESIN-
Ghost violiny version of "Beads of Love."
-LIAM-
Nothing lives up to the original.
-ASHLEY-
(violin strums)
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Yeah,
-LIAM-
It's funny because it's naughty.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Oh, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Mm, I'd love to hear the lyrics sometime.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Is Kyle around?
-MATT-
Kyle is the one (laughs) that was napping in a pile.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Oh.
Kyle the pile.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
He had a hard outing.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
He was weary.
-MATT-
He just wanted to take a nap. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
He got Gallaghered a couple times.
-ASHLEY-
I'm so tired.
-TALIESIN-
That was some naturally occurring Vicious Mockery.
It was just one shot.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
"I've been with you for 100 years!"
-MARISHA-
He's the only one who killed somebody, so.
Poor guy.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's true.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe he earned the nap.
-SAM-
Poor guy.
-MARISHA-
Poor guy.
-TALIESIN-
Poor Kyle.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to float around and see.
-TRAVIS-
No, you're not going to steal from Kyle.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-SAM-
You can steal whatever you want.
-ASHLEY-
Just one bone! Just one femur bone.
-SAM-
Just steal whatever you want.
-MARISHA-
What happened? This is what happens.
-TALIESIN-
I was slowly crawling my way downstairs.
-MARISHA-
You slowly pick away at them. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I know, just one?
-MATT-
What are you doing, Fearne?
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to walk around and see if I can find the double doors.
I'm not going to go in.
I just want to see the lay of the ship.
-MATT-
Okay, yeah.
So as soon as you head down from the deck, the first stairs descend, and they switch back or lead down a hall.
The switchback is where you first went that led into this common area, with the cots and such.
Then beneath that is the deeper storage hall, the cargo hull.
But from the stairs that descend down, the hallway that goes straight leads to the double doors 10 feet later.
So you remember walking past them as you all first descended into this open area.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, okay.
-MATT-
So yeah, you know where they are.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
That's it, I just wanted to know where they were.
-MATT-
Okay.
Well.
-TALIESIN-
Is this where the violin music is coming from?
-LIAM-
Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-LIAM-
It's a party.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Who did this? The whole patterning? The one with the--
-MATT-
Oh yeah, the musician?
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit, that's cool.
-MATT-
"T-Thank you, that's Vendallo."
-TALIESIN-
Vendallo?
-MATT-
Points over at the game table, and there's one thicker skeleton that, based on the jaw and the brow, it looks to be orcish, half-orcish, holds a presence of strength and an honorable majesty for a skeleton in the room.
And has a hand of cards in one hand that's hanging off to the side, and the other is in the process of counting quietly other people's hands in his own way, invested in the tactics of the current game of play.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-TRAVIS-
Do they all have a blue glimmer of a sort in their sockets or just some?
-MATT-
They do, it's very faint in most of the crew, brighter in the immediate secondhand crew of Cyrillia and Woedders.
-TRAVIS-
Cyrillia.
-MATT-
The captain is the most vibrant burning flame.
-SAM-
Do y'all have cannons on this ship?
-MATT-
"N-N-No, no cannons.
Even just the pistols that we have here were taken from recent ships.
That's a fun recent discovery.
Otherwise, we're just used to more of the classic ballista-style assaults."
-SAM-
Oh, got it.
-TRAVIS-
You've stolen a lot of stuff, I imagine, as you've been killing people, yeah.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Is there any stuff you're particularly proud of? Treasure, items?
-SAM-
Oh yeah, loot, booty?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I mean, who else you going to brag to? Impress us.
-MATT-
(laughs) Make a persuasion check.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you're feeling--
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Aw, fucking-- (laughs)
-SAM-
Come on!
-LIAM-
Goddamn it.
-MARISHA-
No.
-TRAVIS-
Persuasion?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
12.
-LIAM-
(groans)
-MATT-
12.
-LIAM-
They're crew members, by the way.
-MATT-
"The best thing about, uh, finding and keeping delightful things is not letting people know what you have."
-LAURA-
Is that true?
-MATT-
"Because then they can't try and take it from you."
-ASHLEY-
Oh, well, I wouldn't know.
-LAURA-
Right.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I-I don't steal.
-ASHLEY-
None of us do that.
-SAM-
Actually, Fearne's quite an adept pickpocket.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, well, we're just coming out with it.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Well, I'm just saying.
-MARISHA-
Did you just say that out loud?
-SAM-
If they're proud of their thieving, maybe a little friendly competition.
-LAURA-
Oh, a thieve off?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, like a little game?
-SAM-
Yeah, maybe in the next 24 hours, maybe if she can swipe something off of you, you would show us some of your booty?
-MATT-
They all look at each other a little strangely.
"How would you even measure such a competition?"
-SAM-
I don't know, I'm pretty sure you'll know it when she shows you something that she's purloined from your person.
-MATT-
"Well, our methods of larceny are a bit more upfront and brutal."
-SAM-
You don't think you have the skills to pick her pocket? She's just a sweet little deer person.
-MATT-
"Maybe Odo." Bruda looks behind, and you can see in the far, far back corner is this tall, thin skeleton--
-SAM-
(like Yoda) Pick her pocket, I can.
-MATT-
-- who has a dark coat that's tattered just past the knees and a collar that's flipped up a bit, and is just sitting there and is in the process of picking out what looks like seaweed that's bunched into parts of the finger bones.
This is one of the back crew that was chasing you down towards the end that fell into the hole.
-TRAVIS-
Butthole.
-SAM-
We forgive.
-TRAVIS-
Yodo?
-LAURA-
Sure.
-MATT-
Odo.
-SAM-
Odo. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
O-D-O?
-LAURA-
Oh-doh!
-MATT-
O-D-O. (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Odo.
-TRAVIS-
Odo.
-SAM-
Odo.
-MATT-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
What was the orc skeleton's name?
-TALIESIN-
Vendallo.
-MATT-
That would be Vendallo.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-SAM-
Odo is a good pickpockety-type person?
-MATT-
"He is our best pilferer on the crew."
-ASHLEY-
Sure, we could give it a go.
We also-- Oh, well, you don't drink.
I was going to say, we know a really good game called What the Fuck Is Up With That?
-SAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-ASHLEY-
And we play it when we drink and it's fun, but--
-MATT-
"We don't drink."
-ASHLEY-
What do you?
-LAURA-
Do you play Rollies?
-SAM-
They're Mormons. (laughs)
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"What's Rollies?"
-LAURA-
It's where you take your dice and you roll them.
-LIAM-
Only the best game ever.
-LAURA-
And then you see who wins.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
It's kind of like War.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
It's really complicated.
-LIAM-
It seems simple at first.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
But the more you play it--
-SAM-
It takes a moment to learn.
-LIAM-
-- the more the complexity comes out.
-SAM-
And a lifetime to master.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
You see a handful of the skeletons lean in, intrigued.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-MATT-
"W-Where, where-- w-what's Rollies from?"
-LAURA-
Just us.
-MARISHA-
We're, um, we're game creators.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Stop it.
-TALIESIN-
Stop.
(laughter)
No!
-SAM-
We have a game company.
-MARISHA-
We have a publishing wing.
-TALIESIN-
Drop it, drop it.
-TRAVIS-
No, no, "Yes, and." (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
No.
-TRAVIS-
(spray bottle)
-MATT-
And that was the last anyone saw Bells Hells.
(laughter)
You can see the table, the ones that are playing cards, games with cards and dice, they're all starting to look over a bit.
"Tell us more about this Rollies."
-LAURA-
Here, do you need those two dice right there?
-MATT-
You see one of the twins glances over.
"Uh, uh, you, here."
-LAURA-
I'll just telepathically bring it up.
-MATT-
They all kind of, "Oh!"
-LAURA-
Telepathically, telekinetically.
-SAM-
Telekinetically.
-LAURA-
Tele, tele, tele.
-TALIESIN-
Telephone.
-LIAM-
Telemarketing.
-LAURA-
Tele.
Here, take one of your dice. (laughs) I'll show you how it works.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Okay."
-SAM-
Oh, the dice that they have on board here are d20s?
-LAURA-
Yeah, of course.
-SAM-
Okay. (laughs) How fortunate.
-MATT-
Polyhedral is an Exandrian keepsake.
-LAURA-
Why not?
-TRAVIS-
I got a couple extra.
I toss some wooden ones out there.
Don't ask where those were.
-LIAM-
They're just Ashley's baby teeth dice.
-LAURA-
We both roll, and whoever gets a higher one wins.
-MATT-
"And then?"
-SAM-
That's the beginner level.
-LAURA-
And then whoever wins...
-LIAM-
Don't knock it.
I think you need to play it to fully appreciate.
-MATT-
"All right."
-SAM-
Rollies!
-LAURA-
Oh, I won.
That was a 16.
Now you have to tell me a secret.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"Double or nothing."
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah, yeah, okay.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-LIAM-
Getting it, they're getting it.
-MARISHA-
So two secrets?
-LIAM-
What'd you roll?
-TRAVIS-
Bruda's a gambler. (laughs)
-MATT-
"Two."
-LAURA-
Three. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Whoo.
-SAM-
Isn't it exciting?
-ASHLEY-
It's fun.
-MATT-
"Triple or nothing."
-LAURA-
No.
-ASHLEY-
No, no.
-MATT-
Another skeleton's like, "Hold on, Bruda." (Bruda) "No, no, no, I'm getting this roll." (laughter)
"I'm getting this Rollies roll."
"I'm getting this Rollies roll."
-SAM-
You can do a variation of the game.
-LAURA-
Tell me a secret.
I won.
-MATT-
"I was allergic to cats when I was alive." (laughter)
-LAURA-
I'm sorry about that.
It must've been hard.
-TALIESIN-
Ask him if he was allergic to ghost cats.
-TRAVIS-
Can we stop talking about cats?
-MATT-
"Now roll!"
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Use your mind powers to throw the game.
-MATT-
"Eight."
-LAURA-
Three, three.
-SAM-
Oh no.
-MATT-
"I win Rollies!"
-LAURA-
Good job.
-MATT-
"Tell me a secret." (laughter)
-LAURA-
One time, when I was little, I saw a bug.
It was crawling up a set of stairs, and it was-- (laughs)
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
(whispers) I'm dating the dead one over there.
-MATT-
"Roll again." (laughter) You now see across the table--
-TRAVIS-
Mainlining Rollies.
-MATT-
The other ones are like-- Crew members are putting their cards down a bit and starting to look for other dice and going--
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-LIAM-
Question, did 20 dead sailors just go--? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Who, me?
-TRAVIS-
Who's the lucky one?
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Yeah.
-MATT-
It took a minute for the eyelines to connect.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Does that mean Vendallo is starting to--
-MATT-
Vendallo's looking a little frustrated.
Vendallo's looking frustrated--
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-MATT-
-- that people are starting to pull away from the game that they were in the process of playing.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to walk by around the table to sit down and have a conversation.
While I'm walking, I just want to lightly scan the twins' cards.
-MATT-
Okay, make a perception check for me.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
No, five.
-MATT-
You see nothing. (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no.
-MATT-
As soon as you start passing by, they both--
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Do we get an idea of what they were playing? Do we recognize the game?
-MATT-
So there are two different games going on, one you didn't recognize and one you did.
Last you saw a game like this, at least, it was Fork of the Storm, which you played at Yios.
-SAM-
Fork of the Storm.
-MATT-
In the casino there.
-MARISHA-
Right.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Though a less fancy presentation.
-TRAVIS-
Money!
-MARISHA-
Which one was that one?
-TALIESIN-
That was the one where you picked three.
-MATT-
"Pick up the dice."
-SAM-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
"Roll!"
-LAURA-
Are we going to be stuck doing this?
-SAM-
This is three days of Rollies.
-ASHLEY-
It's good.
Just do it, just roll.
-TALIESIN-
This is what happens when you teach a five year old how to play a game.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Four.
-MATT-
"Four."
-SAM-
Whoa! This is a double Rollies!
-MATT-
"What happens? (laughter)
-SAM-
So you--
-MATT-
"What happens?" (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Oh my god!
-SAM-
That ends the game for the day.
(laughter)
That actually ends the game for the day.
-MATT-
"No! What happens when they're the same?"
-LAURA-
Then you have to find a new partner.
That's the part of the rules.
-MATT-
"You!" (laughter)
-SAM-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
What happens?!
-MARISHA-
What have we done?
-LIAM-
We just created an addict.
-MATT-
As the gambling chaos begins to take root not even a few hours into your multi-day journey, the beginnings of--
-LAURA-
You would've thought, after this many years, they would've come up with that game themselves.
-SAM-
It's a great game!
-MATT-
Bonding comes in strange ways.
But we'll see where it goes from here, as we'll pull back on the ghost ship, as it pushes into the mists, heading towards what you hope is the destination you requested.
And that's where we'll finish tonight's episode.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
No!
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
No!
-TRAVIS-
That was so great.
-MATT-
Pick up there next time.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Fucking funny.
-ASHLEY-
Love it here.
-MATT-
It's going to be fun.
-LIAM-
"No, again! Now!"
-TRAVIS-
"What happens?!" (laughter)
"What happens?!" (laughs)
-MARISHA-
So good!
-MATT-
The funny thing about being a ghost crew, they don't socialize a lot.
-TRAVIS-
Uh-uh.
-MATT-
They get used to repetition.
Don't really learn new things very often.
-SAM-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
So you are, you're a breath of fresh air to a bunch of undead murderers.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
I love it.
-MARISHA-
I love them all!
-MATT-
You got days of travel ahead.
So we'll see--
-TALIESIN-
I'm so excited.
-MATT-
-- where that takes us.
-SAM-
So far, the Shattered Teeth is the greatest place in all of Exandria.
-ASHLEY-
Let's just stay here.
-MARISHA-
(sighs) Campaign Four, Shattered Teeth only.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Maybe.
-TRAVIS-
We have to go back and dissemble the Key.
No, no, we don't.
(laughter)
We're good down here.
-MATT-
"Did you guys hear that? Gods are dead."
-LAURA-
(laughs) Oh.
-MARISHA-
Rollies!
-MATT-
(laughs) Thank you all so much for joining us.
We'll see you next time.
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
(cheering)

Critical Role Campaign 2 Episode 49 "A Game of Names"
-MATT-
Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
-TRAVIS-
We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
-MATT-
Like that. Before we get started, we have a few announcements to get into. First and foremost, I want to say thank you for all of our community members that came out for the art show this weekend. It went amazingly, it was great to meet a bunch of the artists we had the opportunity to.
Looking forward to meeting all those that we didn't have the opportunity to this time for hopefully future events. It went really well; we hope to do more community-centric things like this in the future. I'm very happy how it all turned out. The live show went really well. Thank you all for coming to that who could. That is coming out in February. Yes, so the VOD for The Search for Grog is coming out in February, we'll have details soon at critrole.com, so keep your eye peeled for that. Let's go ahead and bring it to our fantastic sponsorship for the evening. This week, we have our returning friends and family on the internet, D&amp;D Beyond. Sam, if you don't mind.
-SAM-
Guys, the campaign trail is heating up! As you know, I declared my candidacy for the president of D&amp;D Beyond. I want to thank my constituents for their inventive slogans and mottos that they sent in. I wanted to read a few that you'll be seeing on the #SamforPresident campaign trail. These are just some of my favorites: "Yes We Cantrip!" Pretty good, by @j_viviano. "Nott, My President" by @alyssatombs.
(laughter)
"Crit's About to Get Real!" from @JetPackPaul. "I Did Not Have Sexual Relations With That Manticore," that's Arsequeef. "Putting the 'D' in D&amp;D Beyond" by @JarsonKames, and "Stay Turnt" by Brian Foster, so those are some good ones.
-LAURA-
That one's taken, though.
-SAM-
Yes. Now, I may not know exactly what the president of D&amp;D Beyond does, but I know that it's an important job, and therefore, I feel like I deserve it. But I can't win this race alone, so I'm going to need a campaign-- I'm sorry, a Sampaign manager, so I've enlisted our own Dani Carr to be my Sampaign manager. Yes.
Hi, Dani, thanks for coming tonight.
-DANI-
Hi! You know, I really have more important things to do right now.
-SAM-
I'm sure you do, but thank you for volunteering.
-DANI-
You said you were paying me.
-SAM-
I am, in the form of tape for your reel, so thank you. Anyway, Dani is here tonight to keep me on track as my campaign manager, as I launch into my first ever Sampaign rally speech. Ahem.
Friends, Critters, countrymen. D&amp;D Beyond is a horrifying wasteland of shame, and only I can pull it from the foul, swampy depths of--
-DANI-
Uh-uh.
-SAM-
I mean, D&amp;D Beyond is a wonderful app and a sponsor of this program, where you can build your favorite characters and track their adventures and treasures. Which is why I, Sam Riegel, will unceremoniously decimate its current president, leaving their bodies-- I mean, I'm eager to share my plans to improve this already excellent app.
Here is what the Sam for President Sampaign stands for: under my Riegelship, every character will come preloaded with one inspiration point.
Your default app background will be a picture of me. All characters get 69 hit points.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, yeah!
-LAURA-
No!
-SAM-
Nope? Okay. You'll have a new option: a short rest, a long rest, or a sex nap. Ah! (laughter) Well, that's it for this rally, folks. Next time, we'll unveil my opponent, who will be...
To be determined. In fact, I would like you guys to tweet at me, at D&amp;D Beyond, and, why not? At her, at Dani Carr--
-DANI-
@ItsDaniCarr.
-SAM-
@ItsDaniCarr, with the #SamforPresident, and tell me which one of these guys or gals I should run against. Yes, because it's going to be a fun, exciting battle for the White House, or Gray House, or whatever color the building is where D&amp;D Beyond is. Anyway, thank you, and god bless Samerica! (groaning)
-MATT-
Thank you, Sam.
-ALL-
Thank you, Dani!
-LAURA-
Run away. Run while you can.
-TRAVIS-
I love how you just Weekend Updated your own sponsorship message. That's amazing.
-MATT-
Thank you, Sam; thank you, Dani; and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for your unending patience with this weekly...this. Couple more announcements: the second season of Between the Sheets begins next week, this coming Monday, January 28, at 7:00pm Pacific. The VOD will be available on the Critical Role YouTube channel on Wednesday, January 30. The very first guest is a friend of the show, a musician, rapper, and all-around awesome nerd, Logic.
-LAURA-
And author.
-MATT-
And author, and all sorts of other awesome stuff. He's a very prolific young man, and I can say that because I'm older than him. Super excited, it's going to be great, and happy to kick it off with such an awesome guest.
-TRAVIS-
It's going to be so good!
-MARISHA-
It's going to be good.
It's a good episode.
-TALIESIN-
I've been enjoying the crossover of a whole bunch of Critical Role fans going, "Who's Logic?" and then a whole bunch of Logic fans going, "What's Critical Role?" I was like, this is going to be a train wreck of happiness. I'm so excited.
-MATT-
I'm excited. I want to give a very special thanks to our friends at Wyrmwood, who have continuously supported Critical Role and the community for a very long time. They actually created, for the live show and for the show here, this badass DM screen that I get to unveil!
-LIAM-
Ah, it a dragon!
-TALIESIN-
Ah, there's dragons! Put it back!
-LAURA-
I mean, that's beautiful!
-MATT-
Yeah, they did a really good job with it.
Special thanks especially to Jason MacDonald, who's the master craftsman at Wyrmwood, who made both this DM screen and the table that we play on to life. Jason, you did an amazing job. I had a chance of meeting him at the live show, but you're awesome. Another special thanks to Critter Chris Gladis for our "How Do You Want to Do This?" calligraphy design, which is also used on here.
-TALIESIN-
Ah, too much!
-MATT-
(laughs) Chris, thank you. You did an amazing job.
-TRAVIS-
Give the DM some Xanax.
-MATT-
Apparently. I think that's all I have for announcements, right now, guys.
So-- what have you done?
-SAM-
I don't know, I just found some weird writing on--
-LAURA-
I feel like you copied that at some point.
-SAM-
Did I copy this from something? What is this?
-TALIESIN-
Let me see that.
-SAM-
I don't know.
-LAURA-
Didn't he have to copy some sort of--
-LIAM-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that was when we were talking about the four walls in the temple, right?
-SAM-
Ah, okay.
-MATT-
I like the idea that you sleep-rune sometimes.
-MARISHA-
I knew that this day would come.
-LIAM-
(imitating record played backwards) Thank you, Satan.
-MATT-
Officially played too much D&amp;D.
Not possible.
-LAURA-
Not possible.
-MATT-
Anyway, I think with that, we can go ahead and bring ourselves into tonight's episode of Critical Role.
[water bubbling] [thunder] [explosion] (chanting) Role! Critical! Role! [dramatic Critical Role theme]
-LAURA-
Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead.
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.
-ASHLEY-
(singing) They got magic and flair, they got falchions and cunning. They don't see over there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is waiting, rise up, don't think twice.
Put your fate in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice! (chanting) Role! Critical! Role!
-MATT-
Welcome back, everybody. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had been returning from Nicodranas. They had made their way northward from the Menagerie Coast, left their ship in the care of their favorite tortle to earn money at sea while you're away.
-LIAM-
I like tortles.
-MATT-
You made your way northward, past the Wuyun Gorge, back into the Dwendalian Empire. Passed through Trostenwald and Alfield and met up with Bryce for a bit to catch up, and then made your way toward Felderwin. Upon arriving, you discovered the city was still visibly scarred from the recent assault that it had seemed to suffer at the hands of the Kryn Dynasty from Xhorhas.
Upon perusing the streets, you came to discover that the location that Nott was leading you towards was in ashes: this apothecary. Upon inspecting the vicinity, you did not find a body, but you did find a basement where you found ruined furniture, a few traps, a chest, and a mysterious chair that has grabbed the nation's imagination.
-SAM-
(whispering) Chair'otoa.
-TRAVIS-
(whispering) What is the chair? [laughter]
-MATT-
Y'all going to die. You thought the gazebo was bad. Anyway. So.
-TRAVIS-
Did we put the chair in the bag of holding?
-SAM-
We should've.
-MATT-
However, you also found that apparently the person who previously had lived there was nowhere to be found, and the son of that individual was being held at a nearby home of another person who lives here in Felderwin. You went there with Nott, Nott took the form of a halfling and proceeded to speak to this child as her son. After a bit of interesting conversation and curiosity, you said goodbye and you turned to find these two powerful magic users that Caleb had identified as members of the Cerberus Assembly were walking their way towards the ashen ruins of the apothecary, deep in conversation. That is where we left off. So, Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?
-LIAM-
Before we leap in, could you give a quick physical description again of the two archmages?
-MATT-
Yes, I can do that. We have Lady Vess DeRogna. Yes. She's an elven woman in fine flowing clothes of green and black, deep green with black designs across and around the edges of the billowing sleeves. Jewelry around the fingers, a number of rings and a series of necklaces.
They each contain some sort of a circular gem that dangles from them like a little collection of colors. She has short, medium brown hair, and appears to be of not a young elven age necessarily, but not as old as her current compatriot, which is Martinet Lunidus Da'leth, who is the Archmage of Domestic Protections.
He had long, white hair.
-LIAM-
Also elven?
-MATT-
Also elven. They are both elven.
-LAURA-
Deep blue robes!
-MATT-
Yep, keeping tabs on that. That's really the extent of what you can see at this distance.
You are currently a few houses down, standing outside of Old Edith's house, and in the moment of the tension of the conversation you had just had and the intensity of Nott's disposition, glancing and seeing them walking up and stopping right at the cusp and talking to each other.
-LIAM-
At the apothecary, not where we are? Two separate locations.
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
We need to go now. Right now.
-SAM-
Yes. Yes, we should get off the streets right away.
-LIAM-
These things we have, we have to get them out of here.
-SAM-
I know a place we can go. We can go to near the river. There's a river near here.
-LAURA-
Lead the way.
-LIAM-
Now, please.
-SAM-
Okay. How far is the river?
-MATT-
From where you're standing here, not terribly far, maybe a ten minute walk.
-LAURA-
Is it the opposite direction of the hmm-hmm?
-MATT-
You could loop around a bit, probably go southward. You're not that far from the Samir River. You can scoot a southwestern direction in an arc, probably make it 15 minutes to avoid them entirely.
-LAURA-
Take the cart too, huh?
-SAM-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Let's go.
-SAM-
I will lead them to a spot on the river bank that I know.
-MATT-
All right. Moving past the handful of people in the city that are noticing this strange band of adventurers that have wandered through, you make your way past the outskirts and you can see the river itself cruising right along. It would be a beautiful landscape if there wasn't this intensity of emotion and the distant haze of long-grayed smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the partially burned farmlands. Nevertheless, Nott leads you over towards one of the shaded banks under a few trees and you come to a stop.
-MARISHA-
Are we being followed?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
First roll of the night, no fucking pressure. First roll of the night, you got this.
-MARISHA-
That didn't count. That's good! 21.
-MATT-
Glancing about, you do not see anybody keeping watch. What you do notice, however, is that a lot of the patrolling Righteous Brand, the small bands that have been keeping tabs, are all gathering towards the southern edge where the farm fields of the Felderwin Tillage hit the town of Felderwin. Where as they were scattered, they're all amassing in one space.
-LIAM-
We heard someone describe the operatives from Xhorhas coming up out of the ground over by the farmlands, correct?
-MATT-
Correct. That's as much as you've heard.
-LAURA-
So hey, what the fuck?
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's a good question, but also we just stole some very important things and we saw what is probably the owners going into the building. Is there anything we need to do in this town now to help you do what you need to do here, or can we leave?
-SAM-
No, we can't leave. No, we can't leave.
I mean, you can leave, but I need to stay.
-LIAM-
Is this person you're looking for here, do you know? Do you have any ideas?
-SAM-
I don't know, but I know that-- I don't know.
I don't know where he is, but I know that we'll find clues here or we may find clues here. I need to look. I need to look and I need to start right away, and I suppose you all can go if you want, but--
-LAURA-
I will stay and help you.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we'll stay. Caleb, are you worried about another attack?
-LAURA-
What are you so nervous about?
-TALIESIN-
We are a target.
-LIAM-
We were being stared at as we came through here.
-TALIESIN-
I think we need somewhere safe to talk.
I think there's a lot of things we need to cement up.
-SAM-
This is about as quiet a spot as I know in town, I don't want to go to a pub or anything.
-TALIESIN-
No, obviously not. We need privacy.
-LAURA-
I mean, you're just here to check on your son? That's a good cover, I guess.
Was it your son, or are you even a goblin?
-SAM-
Okay, all right. So you probably have some questions for me and that's all right.
-TRAVIS-
One or two.
-MARISHA-
Like a thousand.
-LAURA-
I mean, if it's your son, that's really sad, Nott.
-SAM-
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for surprising you back there, and I'm sorry that I didn't tell you more before.
-LAURA-
Are you okay?
-SAM-
I don't know, but I feel like-- I don't think any of us need to pretend that we all don't have some secrets. We've all been keeping some secrets from each other. Sometimes I feel like even maybe the thing that brought us together is that we're bonded by dishonesty, a little bit?
-TALIESIN-
Not me, no secrets, open book.
-LAURA-
I'm pretty open, too.
-MARISHA-
I hear you.
-SAM-
Well, some of us, anyway. For me, anyway, I've been holding onto some secrets. I feel like it's almost like putting up an armor or something to protect you from the past, or from regrets or something, and I feel like for some of us, it could also be like a chain, weighing us down and keeping us from moving forward. Maybe it's time now to remove that chain and be open and honest so that we can move ahead. So yes. I'll tell you what you want to know. What do you want to know?
-TRAVIS-
Are you a goblin?
-LAURA-
Is that your son for real?
-SAM-
Okay. Well, hi. My name is Nott the Brave and I am a little goblin girl, but once upon a time, I was Veth, a young halfling woman and before that, a halfling child who grew up being told that she was not pretty and not brave and not coordinated and not smart, and just not.
-LAURA-
And that's you? This is how you looked?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
But you're so pretty!
-SAM-
I was. Then, you know, time went by and I got a little bit older. I was made fun of quite a bit.
I had this-- People thought I was strange because I collected things. I had lots of collections.
They were really outstanding. I collected wax seals and pieces of colored paper and some buttons and fabric.
-MARISHA-
You collected wax seals?
-SAM-
All kinds, yeah.
-MARISHA-
You still have those?
-SAM-
I'm afraid not.
-MARISHA-
That's cool, actually.
-SAM-
They didn't think so. I had brothers and people in town who would ridicule me.
-LAURA-
That was here?
-SAM-
Yes, I lived here. One day, I was playing a game with some other boys and they dared one of their friends to give me a kiss.
-LAURA-
Spin the Bottle!
-SAM-
The boy was very nice and he actually seemed to like it! He and I became friendly and eventually, we did what people do and got married.
-MARISHA-
Oh, that's not-- I went somewhere else.
Yeah, married! Yeah!
-SAM-
He didn't mind my strangeness and I helped him get his apothecary up and running. He was a brilliant chemist and could make acids and potions and oils and bleaches for fabrics and dyes and all sorts of things. I helped him and he took care of me. Eventually, we had a baby named Luke and he was a bright boy. Very smart, he learned to talk very early and walk very early. Such a smart boy! That's who you saw back there is my son.
-LAURA-
So was he right? Did you die?
-SAM-
I think so. We had a rough winter in Felderwin. There was not a lot of crops. I think some of the animals had died that winter. This river I've brought you to, this is a beautiful place. I used to come here with Yeza. It's also an important place because this is the-- the goblins would come from over there. They would come and raid us from the other side of the river. I think after that winter, they got particularly hungry and more dangerous and more daring. They came into town and raided more and more until, one day, they took us. They took me and my husband and my child.
They held us in one of their camps. I don't know if it was days or weeks. I'm not sure. Luke was not doing well. He was starting to starve, and I knew that we needed to get out of there somehow.
Yeza is a very bright man, but he's not a fighter.
So I had to do what I had to do. We ran in the dead of night. They weren't fast. I've been chased a lot in my life by boys making fun of me.
I'm pretty fast. So I told them to run to the river and I broke off and I ran a different way.
The goblins followed me. When they found me, they surrounded me and I fought. I had a vial of acid that Yeza had handed me and I threw it in the face of the one trying to catch us. They didn't like that.
They took me back to their camp. I think he died from his wounds, and he was something like their leader and he had a wife. She brought me to another woman in a hood. A magic woman.
I don't know who she was; I never saw her eyes or anything. This goblin told the woman, "Make her suffer," and they did. They brought me to this river and they drowned me in it. I can still feel the water in my lungs and my ears and my nose. And then nothing until I woke up and saw the hands, those hands, the skin. Then I looked in a puddle.
I could see what they made me. They made me everything that I thought I was: not pretty, not good, just not. I'll be honest. I've started forgetting what it feels like to be a halfling, to be me. I don't remember everything any more.
I feel like every day I'm more and more goblin. I don't like it at all. I don't like myself at all.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry I lied, and I'm sorry, Caleb, that I didn't tell you.
I should've told you. You would've understood, and maybe you could've helped me. I don't know. I feel like you're almost there. Almost strong enough to help, but I didn't want to distract you from your path.
Anyway. That's how I got to you. That's why I can't be in that town and he can't see me like this, my son can't see me like this.
No one there can.
-TALIESIN-
Does your husband know? Does he not know?
-SAM-
I've sent him things.
-TALIESIN-
So he knows you're alive.
-SAM-
Well, I only recently started signing the letters. I don't know if he believes it or not.
I don't know what he would think of me. The people in that town, they're taught to kill a goblin on sight or run and get help. Children are told rhymes. If he saw me like this, I don't even know if he would believe it's me.
-TALIESIN-
He'll know you. Nott, you ran and got help and here we are. It's the right thing to do.
We're here to help.
-LAURA-
How long has it been?
-SAM-
Since I've been like this? Well, they turned me and then they kept me around. They used me like a slave, really. I would clean out their messes and clean up after the meals. I would help their one that tortured. I would help him for months. Maybe six months. Then I ran. That's when I found you, shortly after, so maybe a year? No. More. More than a year. Year and a half? I don't know.
Not exactly. It's all sort of a blur.
-LAURA-
I feel like we can get this fixed.
-TALIESIN-
We're here now.
-LAURA-
We can do something.
-TALIESIN-
We just have to take some time, think carefully and slowly.
-SAM-
I don't think we have time. He's gone. They could be killing him now, these people that have him.
-TRAVIS-
Do we know who we think that is?
-LAURA-
Is it the people you know?
-LIAM-
Is anyone else-- Is there anyone coming? Do we hear anything?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
Natural one.
-MATT-
Your emotions are transfixed and even though you look around, your attention's still focused on Nott.
Nothing catches your eye.
-TALIESIN-
We can do something about this, but you're going to have to trust us and you're going to have to be careful because if we move too quickly, we're just going to go running the wrong direction and alone. And you need help.
-SAM-
I will try to restrain myself, but honestly, I don't know for how long.
-TALIESIN-
Would it help if we cleared your head?
-SAM-
What do you mean?
-TALIESIN-
Well, if you need a minute to be here, we maybe sift some of the contents of that flask out of you for a little while. Just for a minute.
You can get back to it when you need it, but for now, maybe impulse may not be your friend right now.
-SAM-
Okay. If you think so, Mr. Clay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to try and do that. We had a brief conversation about that last week.
-MATT-
So you're casting Lesser Restoration?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Try to un-drunk Nott.
-MATT-
Technically alcohol is a toxin.
-TALIESIN-
I have to know what it is.
I have to be going for it.
-MATT-
Yeah, so I'll allow it.
-TALIESIN-
I am so sorry.
-MATT-
You feel this warm glow emanating from Caduceus' hands and then in that moment, the fuzzy numbness that you are accustomed to sitting in, especially in places of great fear or emotion, fades.
And everything's back to being crystal clear.
-TALIESIN-
Sometimes the truth takes a little while to get there.
-SAM-
This feels much worse. It feels terrible, actually. This is terrible. This is how you all are, all the time? This is not fun.
-TRAVIS-
Majority.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Nott, I know this place is--
-LAURA-
Do you want some candy?
-SAM-
Yes, lots.
-MARISHA-
This place is quiet, but do you actually know if there a waterfall upstream a little bit, or a brook? Something with some noise that might drown out anyone who's listening.
-TALIESIN-
Maybe somewhere where we can sleep, too.
-MARISHA-
Further off the beaten path.
We walk upstream, maybe?
-SAM-
Is there such a place?
-MATT-
There's not much in the way of a waterfall, unfortunately. You're in the center of the valley, so what hills there are, are just hills. The river here continues cutting through the valley, but you're probably a good, off the top of my head, 40 or so miles from any elevation to cause a major waterfall.
-MARISHA-
Any babbling brooks?
-MATT-
You're next to the river and what little noise it's making. It's nice.
-TALIESIN-
We know that there are tunnels.
-LIAM-
By the farmlands.
-MARISHA-
Which is, I think, where all those soldiers were going.
-TALIESIN-
Well, maybe we should find somewhere in town to hold up, and we'll keep you out of sight.
-MATT-
There was that one inn that burned down, but there is one inn you know called the Goldfield Tavern and Lodge. That's one of the more traveled inns. A lot of people that come in and out of Felderwin, that's one of the more popular destinations.
-TALIESIN-
What's your husband's name?
-SAM-
Yeza Brenatto.
-TALIESIN-
I think, perhaps, if we're going to, we should come together with a game plan. I think it would be respectable if people thought that someone was looking for Yeza in his interests.
People will be less suspicious if we're asking questions about someone who disappeared, if we were perhaps hired by a trust fund of your son or otherwise, and this is something that is owed to him.
It's just business; we don't have to let them know it's personal.
-TRAVIS-
That's actually very clever.
-SAM-
That's fine, but-- and I'm sorry, Caleb. I'm sorry for what I said before. I feel like part of what we'll need to do to find him is to know what he was doing before he was taken, and that involves you.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you definitely puked all over that apothecary, so it's clear that something's not right.
-SAM-
I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to, but I need you now. I need you to tell me what you know, what these people might be doing, or might have taken him to, or done with him.
-LAURA-
I mean, it does seem like they were using him.
-MARISHA-
What is dunamis?
-LAURA-
How do you know them?
-TALIESIN-
That's a lot. You can take your time. As you're ready.
-LIAM-
Are we going to...
-SAM-
Do you want to get somewhere safer first?
-TRAVIS-
Further away? Why don't we keep moving upstream? What's the direction away from the conflict?
-MATT-
There's northeast and southwest. Northeast would be more in the direction of the fields and clearer view. Southwest would be further away from civilization.
-TALIESIN-
I'll also say, we can start the wagon up, and I can drive and keep an eye out. If you're all inside the wagon, no one's going to see any of you.
-TRAVIS-
Sure, let's head south.
-MARISHA-
Let's find a patch of woods to hide in.
-LAURA-
Are there woods?
-MATT-
There's little clusters of trees here and there.
-TALIESIN-
It may be, in the end, safer staying in town. People staying in the woods seem like they're trying to avoid something, and there's a lot of soldiers. If you're on business, you go to town, even if the town's a little rough. We'll keep going around. When it's time to go, I think maybe we go into town and get a room. Maybe make a little bubble in the room, if we have to.
-LIAM-
I don't want to talk in town.
-TALIESIN-
We're going to take a scenic route.
I'll take a long time, and if I see people, I'm not going to drive towards them.
-TRAVIS-
Before we go, are you sure your son is safe with this--
-SAM-
No, I'm not sure at all.
-TRAVIS-
What did you tell her last? Are they staying? Are they going?
-SAM-
They're staying. I gave them some money.
Edith seemed to think that they were okay for the time being and that there's not going to be any more imminent attacks.
-TRAVIS-
Do other people in town know that old Edith cares for your son, that they're connected in some way?
-SAM-
No idea.
-MARISHA-
Does old Edith know your current form?
-SAM-
No one does.
-MARISHA-
She just thinks you're not dead.
-SAM-
Well, I'm not.
-LIAM-
What do you think that your child made of that?
-SAM-
I don't know, but I know that I needed to see him. I forgot what he looked like, and he forgot what I looked like. I feel like that's impossible.
That's unsustainable. We need to know the ones we love, and I don't know what that was. I don't know how he felt, but for me it's a step. As painful as it was, it will be a step towards something.
-MARISHA-
Nott, you drowned. You drowned, and you just spent three months underwater.
That's incredible. I don't know if you realize that, but--
-SAM-
Yeah, it was great. It was-- it sucked.
It was terrible.
-TALIESIN-
It was very brave.
-SAM-
You guys have rubbed off on me, I guess.
-TRAVIS-
I don't want to tell you what to do, but I feel like our previous experience would lean towards getting your son and her out of here, especially if the people that have taken your husband are still here. If they're searching for answers or asking people questions, that could lead to her and him.
-LAURA-
They could go stay with my mama. They could stay at the Lavish Chateau for the time being.
-TALIESIN-
Anywhere west, really.
-TRAVIS-
Now's the time to move them.
-SAM-
Right. How? How would I convince--
-TRAVIS-
Maybe it's not you. Maybe one of us go.
-SAM-
Go to tell them?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-TALIESIN-
Not a bad idea.
-SAM-
How do they get there? It's a dangerous journey, even for us. You saw the borders.
-MARISHA-
Loops into Caduceus' social worker plan, actually.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know if necessarily crossing the border is the way to go, but at least going further inland.
-TRAVIS-
If they do decide to cross, I think they're less concerned with people going out more than coming in.
-SAM-
Do we know any place safe closer? Is Alfield safe?
-TALIESIN-
Safe as anything.
-LAURA-
Bryce is there.
-TALIESIN-
That's not a bad idea. Send a letter.
Ask Bryce if they can take care of this.
-MARISHA-
Do you think Bryce would be down for more responsibility and obligations?
-TALIESIN-
I imagine, if we pack a few gold in.
It's not much to find some room and board for a couple people.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's true.
-TRAVIS-
If it does continue to drift that way, Bryce will be sure to get them out quick.
-TALIESIN-
Or send word.
-MARISHA-
Plus, Alfield is near the border and the gates. Shorter journey out.
-LAURA-
I could send a message, see if Bryce would be okay with that. What do you think?
-SAM-
Okay, yes. Please do.
-TRAVIS-
There's a lot to figure. This will be one less thing to worry about.
-MARISHA-
Then we try to find Yeza?
-SAM-
Absolutely. Yes.
-LAURA-
I'm going to not be able to do this in 25 words. It's so hard!
-MATT-
Cast it twice.
-TRAVIS-
This is going to Bryce?
-LAURA-
This is going to Bryce. Okay.
-SAM-
I believe in you, Jester. You can do this.
-TRAVIS-
Woman and child incoming.
Take care of them.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's good. Don't talk in full sentences. Why didn't I think of that?!
-TALIESIN-
Stop.
-LAURA-
Do I say stop?
-TALIESIN-
Stop.
-TRAVIS-
Don't waste it on a stop.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, that's what you would do if you're doing the telegram.
-LAURA-
I could just vocally stop because Bryce will hear me.
-TALIESIN-
Stop.
LAURA. Right. Okay. I'm going to cast Sending.
-LAURA-
Hello.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, boy.
-LAURA-
It's Jester. Two people incoming. A woman and child. Take care of them, please? We're sending money with them.
-SAM-
You have two more words.
-LAURA-
This is important.
-LIAM-
Cut off the "is".
-LAURA-
I thought I had five more words!
-MATT-
You have two more.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Signed... oh.
-LAURA-
Please help.
-MARISHA-
Is it one word? Pleasehelp!
-MATT-
As the sporadic phrases make their way through the arcane weaves of the various magical ley lines that invisibly traverse the exterior of Exandria, they make their way towards Bryce's ear somewhere in Alfield, and they respond, a moment later, "All right. I'll do my best.
Please don't send too many more?" (laughter)
That was it.
-LAURA-
Okay. I think they're going to help!
-SAM-
Okay. That's something.
-TRAVIS-
Bryce is shaking their head, trying to get better reception and it's not working.
-TALIESIN-
Water in the ear.
-MARISHA-
You're cutting out and I can't--
-LAURA-
Okay. Oh, sorry about that.
-TALIESIN-
It's nothing.
-SAM-
So, shall we ride around a bit?
-LAURA-
Yes, because I want to hear what Caleb has to say.
-TALIESIN-
I also want to get a sense of things, so we're going to take a lazy meander around the area. I want to get a sense of where things are, get a map in my head, and I'm going to be paying very close attention.
-MATT-
Through the city?
-TALIESIN-
No, on the outskirts.
-MATT-
Okay. It'll take you a while.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to keep going around until they...
-MATT-
Okay. Make a perception check for me, Caduceus, as you guys are passing around the southern edge, heading towards the western side of Felderwin.
-TALIESIN-
That's okay, it's all right. Eight.
Wait, no, I'm so sorry, that's wrong. 13.
-MATT-
Okay. Keeping an eye out, the main thing you notice, it seems like a majority of the Righteous Brand have gathered and are heading northeast.
They are leaving Felderwin.
-MARISHA-
Leaving.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Does it look like they've discovered the tunnels, or no?
-MATT-
You don't know, you're too far away. You haven't really asked any specific questions to the local crownsguard.
-TALIESIN-
That'll be for civilization; that's cool.
-MATT-
Best you can see here-- the flames have been long out. What brief cinders and wisps of smoke that had been slowly burning themselves out over the past couple of weeks or so are on the very tail end. It looks like Felderwin has fallen to at least a semblance of temporary neutrality. The people are going about their lives, the Tillage-- the damage that has been done, has been done, and now it's just trying to pick up and move on.
-LIAM-
We're in the wagon?
-MATT-
You're in the wagon. You're now on the western side of the village where you can see the northward Tillage all around.
-TALIESIN-
I'm on the lookout, and I will let anybody know if anyone's within 60 yards.
-MARISHA-
Are you listening, to where you can contribute?
-TALIESIN-
I think I'm listening, but I'm not doing a very good job of it.
-TRAVIS-
Because you're checking out around us.
-TALIESIN-
Because I'm--
-TRAVIS-
Periscoping.
-MARISHA-
Hey, Jester.
-LAURA-
Mm?
-MARISHA-
Since we're going to try and be honest with each other and turn a new leaf--
-LAURA-
Are you in love with me?
-MARISHA-
Well, in a way. I didn't sleep with Dairon. She wasn't my roommate.
She was my teacher.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
I don't know why I told you that.
-LAURA-
I don't either.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Teachers are cool, too.
-SAM-
You slept with your teacher?
-MARISHA-
No, I didn't sleep with her at all.
I totally made that up.
-LAURA-
You just cared about your teacher.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Good for you.
-MARISHA-
Thanks.
-SAM-
I know there's more pressing matters, but what did she teach you?
-MARISHA-
How to kick ass and take names, bitch.
-SAM-
Cool.
-TRAVIS-
Snaps.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's easier to pretend like you don't care.
-LAURA-
Well, I figured you cared since you were checking up on her.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. I'm a little transparent sometimes.
-LAURA-
(laughs) I totally thought she was your roommate. You were really good about that.
-MARISHA-
Thank you.
-LAURA-
You're welcome.
-MARISHA-
I mean, don't get me wrong. I'd totally tap that, but--
-TRAVIS-
All right, can we maybe circle back to the...?
-LAURA-
Caleb. We can tell you're really scared, and that's okay, to be scared. We just don't know why.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe if you share with us your apprehensions, it'll ease it a bit?
-LIAM-
(deep breath) <i>Mist</i>.
-MARISHA-
You got this, man.
-LIAM-
Your name is... Veth.
-SAM-
It was.
-LIAM-
My name was... Bren Aldric Ermendrud. Was.
-SAM-
That's why you looked at me, that day.
-LIAM-
I, uh...
-LAURA-
Did you die, too?
-SAM-
Twinsies?
-LIAM-
I have been using you all.
-LAURA-
How?
-LIAM-
I am from Rexxentrum. I attended the Soltryce Academy, and I was plucked by one of the Cerberus Assembly with a few others, and was being trained to do the kinds of things that I fear may have been done to--
-LAURA-
Yeza.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>. And.... a lot of big plans for me that didn't pan out, and I went a little crazy.
And I ran away. I ran away. I've been on the run for a long time, and I was tired of starving.
And I met... I met you and was a little less hungry for a while. I have just been afraid for a long time, and two of the people in that town over there are on the Cerberus Assembly.
-SAM-
Do you know them?
-LIAM-
I know who they are.
-LAURA-
Would they know who you are?
-LIAM-
I don't think so, but I have walked past their portraits at school many times.
-MARISHA-
Ew.
-LAURA-
They're high up then, huh?
-LIAM-
One of them is the head of the Cerberus Assembly.
-LAURA-
Holy shit.
-TRAVIS-
The head of the whole thing?
-SAM-
It was that big?
-MARISHA-
Mister Fancypants?
-LAURA-
Wait, isn't that where you want to go, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, I did. That's the center of magical teaching in the Empire, as I understood it.
-LAURA-
It's really bad or something?
-LIAM-
There's good teachers there. It's everything that they describe it to be, but after going there for several months, one of the Assembly, who also would teach on occasion, started interviewing me, calling me in and asking me a lot of questions. He put me in advanced class, me and a few others.
I don't want you all to be seen with me, because if you are seen with me by one of them, they will use you to get to me.
-SAM-
I mean, I don't want them to see me either because they'll kill me and everyone I'm with, anyone in town, so I think we'll be hiding for some time.
-LIAM-
You met the man who trained me.
His name is Trent Ikithon.
-LAURA-
That's why you always make that face.
I'm sorry, Caleb.
-LIAM-
I'm not a very good person.
-LAURA-
Well, I don't think our actions define who we are all the time. Good people do bad things sometimes. Even bad people do good things.
I think you're a good person.
-MARISHA-
For the record, Nott, I don't think it's us that's been rubbing off on you. I think it's you that's been rubbing off on us.
-TRAVIS-
Also, I don't think a very bad person would care about us.
-LAURA-
I don't think a very bad person would care that he was very bad.
-MARISHA-
Do you care about us? You've told us several times how you've been using us.
-LAURA-
Are you secretly in love with me? (laughter)
-LIAM-
I'm worried about your husband. I know the things that they can do.
And I start to unwrap one of my arms.
-SAM-
Arms?
-LAURA-
Like the skin?
-LIAM-
No, I have been wearing bandages on my arm, and there are little, very faint scars all up the arm.
-SAM-
Cuts? Or burns?
-LIAM-
They are scars, faint scars, from cuts.
-SAM-
From cuts.
-LIAM-
He used to put crystals in-- he experimented on us, on the three of us.
-SAM-
What would they do? Crystals?
-LIAM-
He was trying to strengthen us.
-MARISHA-
The dunamis?
-LIAM-
No. The first time I had ever seen that word was in your libraries, just haphazardly scrawled into a book, no explanation. No, everything was for Empire. We were being trained to serve our Empire, above all else. He was a little mad, himself. That is-- he was mad.
-MARISHA-
I'm curious as to how much was for the Empire and how much the Empire was a veil for his own personal exploits.
-LIAM-
He believed that the unwashed masses relied on their base instincts and the highest calling was to rise above the muck and control the cattle for the good of all.
-LAURA-
That sounds like a bad person.
-LIAM-
But we were-- are-- at war. Many of us felt that way-- feel that way.
-SAM-
Do you still feel that way?
-LIAM-
I don't believe in anything now.
-TRAVIS-
This Trent, does he know these two that we saw?
-LIAM-
Yes. I don't want one more thing on my head, to have you guys-- it's probably too late, anyway.
-TRAVIS-
How powerful are these two? Our normal tricks, would they fall short?
-LIAM-
The Cerberus Assembly are the most powerful mages in the Empire. Over two centuries ago, a number of mages went to war in the streets of Rexxentrum. It was bloody and awful, and eventually they came to a truce and banded together and proposed to the king at the time that they serve as an advising body alongside the throne.
-LAURA-
Would they see if we were disguised, or would they have to look for us? Do you know what I mean?
-LIAM-
I don't know for sure, but there is a reason why I did not use anything like that back there.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
So we need to give them a very wide berth.
At the same time, we need to figure out where--
-SAM-
Why would they have taken my husband? He was not a magic person. He was just a chemist.
-LIAM-
I don't know. It is something to do with the thing.
-LAURA-
It says it.
-LIAM-
But I don't know why him.
-LAURA-
It says, "His instincts are solid."
-SAM-
What instincts?
-LAURA-
Yeza, I'm assuming. "While I find this alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity--" I'm sorry, I don't believe that.
-SAM-
I don't either.
-LAURA-
"The Academy's eye for talent proves itself again."
-LIAM-
Was he gifted? In his work?
-SAM-
He was very brilliant in his work, but I never saw him do any magicky things.
-TRAVIS-
Did he experiment?
-LAURA-
It says they want him to produce a number of batches of that liquid, the one that we stole?
-LIAM-
That is what is written about there, it talks about-- Listen, I don't pretend to know what we're talking about, but it does not seem like anything that I ever studied.
-SAM-
He was good at what he did. He could refine anything.
-LAURA-
They wouldn't kill him then. They need him to make batches over the next 12 to 16 months.
-TRAVIS-
I'm sure he's alive, but if he was good at breaking things down, taking them apart, experimenting on things, this thing that we have falls directly into that.
-LIAM-
It says they were looking for a way to achieve their ends without the object. I don't know what they need. I hope he is alive, I truly do. They will make his life very painful, though.
-MARISHA-
Trent Ikithon was looking at Yasha. He was side-eyeing Yasha.
-TRAVIS-
What do you mean?
-LAURA-
Well, she's really hot.
-MARISHA-
I feel like I've heard these words before, when we were in that bar. He looks for prodigies, people with innate talent. I don't think it matters--
-SAM-
If they took my husband, where would they have taken him? Their headquarters are in Rexxentrum?
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>.
-SAM-
At a school, at a--?
-LIAM-
The city of Rexxentrum.
-SAM-
The whole city is their headquarters?
-LIAM-
They're based there.
-MARISHA-
The Cerberus Assembly actually has a pretty heavy hold on Rexxentrum.
-LIAM-
And the Empire. They are close to as powerful-- arguably more powerful than the King.
-LAURA-
I wonder if maybe we can break him out before he gets there? Maybe he-- it only just happened.
-SAM-
Do they have magical means of transport?
-LIAM-
We watched Lunidus Da'leth appear 200 feet in front of us.
-SAM-
So he could already be there.
-LIAM-
Maybe.
-MARISHA-
I'd be willing to lay money on it.
-SAM-
When did you get your new name?
-LIAM-
I used a lot of names. Caleb is just what I told you.
-TRAVIS-
What do you prefer?
-LIAM-
I don't know. Caleb; let's stick with Caleb for now.
-SAM-
Well...shit. It seems like if we are going to chase down my husband, you're going to have to go into danger. Too much danger.
-LIAM-
(stuttering) I honestly don't know if we can-- if we are up to this. Unless they're en route on land, maybe, but... that's all the might of the Empire.
-LAURA-
Are we going to have to scout out and listen in on people's conversations, see if we can--?
-TRAVIS-
We should ask to see if anyone saw a carriage, anything, leaving town with Yeza.
-LAURA-
Maybe if we go with our insurance company scheme, we can say that we believe there's been fraud and he's not really dead or something.
-SAM-
And--
-MARISHA-
Nott.
-SAM-
Yes?
-MARISHA-
Sorry, you were going to say something.
-SAM-
No, I just had more questions.
-MARISHA-
All right, I was going to ask you a question. I don't think you know the answer,
though. Your son mentioned that a mean lady with pointy ears keeps coming by.
-SAM-
Was that one of these people that we saw?
-LAURA-
Lady--
-SAM-
They had pointy ears. They're elves, right?
-LIAM-
They're both elves.
-SAM-
Then what? One of them look mean?
-MARISHA-
Well, if he's talking about Vess DeRogna--
-SAM-
Is that someone who would have-- do you know her to be someone who would be-- someone who could harness chemicals and--?
-LIAM-
Vess DeRogna-- I'm sorry, no. Vess DeRogna is the Archmage of Antiquities. She is half a recluse.
She taught at the school-- not me, or years above me.
-SAM-
Would she be interested in the things that Yeza was helping?
-LIAM-
She's a historian. She knows-- she has uncovered mysteries of the past, they would say at school. She's a history buff and awful as well, probably.
-SAM-
Could she be the one who is visiting my home?
-MARISHA-
It sounds like they've been here watching your husband for quite some time, which means checking in on your son.
-LIAM-
Da'leth is Domestic Protection. He is the head of the military. If they are both here, I would imagine that he is here overseeing all of the Red Brands we saw and she is probably here trying to figure out what's in that bag.
-SAM-
Then, do we have-- because I don't know how this all connects. Do we know why the cricks also attacked? Did they sense a disturbance in their juice or whatever that stuff is? The dunamis?
-LAURA-
Do you think maybe they're attacking because we have the thingy?
-SAM-
We've had the thingy for a long time. It doesn't explain why they would attack here, now.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
They could be combing the Empire for it.
-TRAVIS-
It might not be the only one.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
It feels like-- it is a piece of dunamis, right?
-MATT-
Caleb, roll an intelligence check for me.
-LIAM-
Thank you.
-LAURA-
Be smart. Be so smart.
-LIAM-
19.
-TRAVIS-
Pretty smart.
-MATT-
On the notes, where it mentions beacons--
-LAURA-
It says there's other beacons.
-LIAM-
More than one, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, and this thing that we had was called "the beacon." Right, okay.
-LAURA-
Okay, so there's more than one.
-LIAM-
We saw an attack on the tower in Zadash.
That was ages ago at this point. And now they're well into the Empire.
-LAURA-
"As we continue to invoke the beacon--" That means they have one.
-SAM-
Or had one.
-LAURA-
Right. "--with extremely focused energy of different spectrums and sources, divine and arcane, the effects unleashed are ever curious and reach far beyond this laboratory. The dunamis field often sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town, with locals complaining of an ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged down." So--
-SAM-
So they had one of our dodecahedrons here.
-LAURA-
Oh my god, what if you put the dodecahedron on the tripod thing that we got, right? Then we hit it with some sort of spell. I wonder if it would amplify that spell, you know what I mean?
-TRAVIS-
And also ring the dinner bell, Jester. I think that's the more dangerous part. We're super close to the front line, or at least to them. You do that, we might get exactly what we're asking for, but then trouble might also come calling.
-LAURA-
That's true.
-MARISHA-
The people that we saw fighting, having the DC fight in the air, full on anime battle-- did we recognize the-- because I know they were wizards that were fighting the crick assassins that were coming in.
-MATT-
It seemed to be the case, yes.
-MARISHA-
Do we recognise the clothing and appearance of the Archmage and Lady Vess? Is it the same people?
-MATT-
No. Not the people that are currently with you now, no. The people that are in the city.
-MARISHA-
But the same robes?
-MATT-
There isn't a uniform robe. There is no-- and you would know this, too. Even mages in a union aren't like, "Let's all wear similar uniforms." They all very much see themselves as individuals in a circle.
-LIAM-
What about the annexes?
-MATT-
Hmm?
-LIAM-
The annexes? People who-- it was in the lore that you shared with me.
-MATT-
Oh right, yeah. No. For students and everything there would be uniforms, but as far as members of the Assembly proper, there's no consistent uniform amongst members of the Assembly. As is the nature when you get to a certain level of arcane capabilities, even working with other mages, there's a general, for the most part, an idea of "Well, I'm still better than them."
-LIAM-
These papers conjecture that in Ghor Dranas they are able to control fate and time. Clearly it was stolen from them and brought here, so it could be the source of their presence here.
-MARISHA-
Caleb, you were in the library of the Cobalt Soul when you stumbled upon dunamis for the for the first time.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>, it was a note scrawled to the side of a book. It said that the Cerberus Assembly was looking into some sort of new arcane study and the word "dunamis" was written. That was it.
-MARISHA-
What were you looking for when you found it? What were you trying to find?
-LIAM-
I was studying history, and-- I need to become more powerful if I want to do anything.
-MARISHA-
You still haven't answered my previous question of how you were using us and what that means to you.
-LIAM-
Look at me. I am a string bean, I am weak as it comes. I am weak. Look at that. Look at her.
-LAURA-
Look at me.
-MARISHA-
Her guns are bigger than mine.
-LIAM-
You have no guns. That was an exaggeration that day. You are just fast and quick and talented.
-MARISHA-
Okay. Was that a compliment?
-TRAVIS-
I think so.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
It's kind of like when you smile.
-SAM-
I feel like there's a difference between using someone and relying on someone.
-MARISHA-
That's what I was going to say. Do you think that Fjord was using us? You think that Nott's been using us?
-TALIESIN-
(whispering) Shut up, Travis.
-MARISHA-
You know, we're also here volunteering our help.
-LAURA-
It's only using us if you don't like us. Do you like us, though?
-LIAM-
<i>Ja.</i>
-LAURA-
<i>Ja!</i>
-SAM-
You do?
-LIAM-
(sighs) I... Oh, Jester. I am glad you see good in me.
-MARISHA-
Caleb, you were right when you said earlier that it's too late now. That we're involved.
But I don't think we see it in the same way that you do. It's too late now because, whether you like it or not, we all care about you and are invested in, you know, your happiness, I guess? So...
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Don't run. You can say you don't believe in anything, and that's fine. Believe in us, just a little bit?
-LIAM-
I will consider it heavily.
-MARISHA-
I'm sorry for not hearing you yesterday.
Honestly, you saying that you don't believe in anything kind of put everything into perspective about that conversation. I heard that you were doubting me and us, and our friendship.
-LIAM-
I don't doubt any of you at all.
(louder) You too!
-TALIESIN-
Uh, yeah. I'll have some if someone's making something.
(laughter)
-SAM-
He could give two shits.
-TRAVIS-
You're going to have to do this twice.
-MARISHA-
One last time!
-LIAM-
That one will be off-camera.
-TALIESIN-
Very off-camera.
-TRAVIS-
So do we avoid your two professors? Or do we try to study them, divide them, interrogate one of them--
-LAURA-
Fjord, they're way too powerful for us.
-TRAVIS-
You don't know that.
-LAURA-
Fjord.
-TRAVIS-
What? I swallow shit and make it appear in my weapons; I'm fucking down to throw, you know what I'm saying?
-LAURA-
You can control water, which I can do too; I'm not that powerful.
-TRAVIS-
You don't have to minimize my new shit, okay? I'm real proud of it. I've had it for a fucking hot second.
-LAURA-
I'm just saying, they've probably been studying for a very long time. And if I'm not wrong they're elves. And elves live for a very long time. And they look kind of old, okay? So they're probably--
-LIAM-
The elder gentleman started the Cerberus Assembly over 250 years ago.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, maybe we don't try to separate him.
Right. Well, what about the one that studies history? You met a bunch of really dangerous historians?
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Yeah, I have.
-TRAVIS-
What do I know, man? I'm a fucking sailor.
-LAURA-
You're pretty powerful, okay? You're really strong. You're very handsome. You got some really cool spells. You can make darkness appear. It's really awesome.
-TRAVIS-
Listen, Jester-- As much as I love this, it's not about me, okay?
-TALIESIN-
Hey, if you all don't stop arguing, I'm going to turn this cart right around.
-LAURA-
Yes, sir!
-TALIESIN-
I don't know if you were arguing, I've just always wanted to say that.
-LAURA-
We were. We were having a big fight.
-TALIESIN-
Man!
-TRAVIS-
So what do we do?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to start heading back to town regardless; it's getting cold.
-TRAVIS-
We need to send your son on his way.
-SAM-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
Do we need to try and--
-LIAM-
That's a tangible goal that we can do.
-TRAVIS-
Do we want to ask if your husband was spotted leaving by some sort of natural means?
-SAM-
Sure, yes.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Then we kill the two elves.
-LAURA-
Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Maybe we go up into their room at night or something and just, you know... Stabby stab.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you seduce one, I'll seduce the other, no problem. I have a way with elvish folk.
-TALIESIN-
It's like you two have been reading Tumblr. This is so-- Sorry, carry on.
-TRAVIS-
We'll deal with one thing at a time.
-SAM-
It would make me happy to even know that he's alive. To get some sort confirmation that someone saw him alive or...
-TRAVIS-
Have we talked about sending a message?
-LAURA-
(gasp) Maybe I can send a message to him!
-TRAVIS-
I mean, if he's in Super Magical Headquarters, I'm sure there might be protection against that, but--
-SAM-
Is that a bad idea? That's a bad idea.
-TALIESIN-
Wait, what? You trying to find out if someone's alive?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I can do that.
-TRAVIS-
Oh--
-SAM-
How?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah! Your Wildmother-- the thing you did for me!
-MARISHA-
Caduceus is a wild mom?
-TRAVIS-
No. Nope. No, he has--
-LAURA-
He's such a wild mom; he's partying all the time!
-MARISHA-
So many wine spritzers.
-SAM-
Moms gone wild?
-TALIESIN-
Moms gone wild. What? Hmm?
-SAM-
What is the process by which you would...
-TALIESIN-
I would just-- I have a little ritual in the morning, meditate on it, see if I can feel anything tugging in some direction; and I couldn't know much, but I could know something.
-SAM-
Well do you think, Caleb, that they would sense that? Is that a magical force? Is that a divine force?
-TALIESIN-
It's a divine force, but I don't think that it would--
-LAURA-
Do you have to do it in the morning or can you do it at night?
-TALIESIN-
Well I mean, I'd have to sleep.
-LAURA-
Oh; I understand.
-LIAM-
It all depends on how he reacts if Caduceus is able to contact him.
-TALIESIN-
I couldn't know much. But I could maybe, at the very least, give you a yes/no. Maybe.
-SAM-
That would make me very happy.
-LAURA-
So we head to the inn.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
We don't talk about anything when we're in the town, right?
-SAM-
Except someone has to ask about--
-TRAVIS-
We can do that. Cover of night. Helps.
-TALIESIN-
Well I'm happy we're coming to town to talk to this famous alchemist and this has really thrown something into our plans. I don't know what-- Do people throw monkeys into plans? What do people throw?
-MARISHA-
Close.
-SAM-
It's a wrench.
-TALIESIN-
A wrench? Yeah, this has wrenched our monkey.
-LIAM-
A couple of us tonight-- not me, but a couple of us could check the town out, and ask some questions, and ask if many people were taken away or not.
-TALIESIN-
Hmm, not a bad idea.
-TRAVIS-
To the inn?
-TALIESIN-
I'm already heading that way.
-LAURA-
I'm going to take everything that we've been looking at and stick in the bag so it can't be scried on or something.
-MATT-
Okay. You guys make your way towards Felderwin proper. Through this conversation, the majority of the Righteous Brand has moved on, heading northeast towards the front lines.
Crownsguard are still present and there still is, definitely amongst those that are here-- and Nott, you can say that there are more crownsguard present here than there usually are. Probably just to keep an eye now that the military has moved on.
You make your way towards the center of the city, leading them towards the Goldfield Tavern and Lodge. Heading inside, it's fairly empty. You place the cart outside for the time being. Towards the bar on the far end, you see the familiar face of Simone Deepwell. He's the halfling, the barkeep, and owner. Dark brown skin; short, gray-white hair. Very cheerful demeanor, he seems to be excited at the prospect that folks are stopping in with all the chaos that's happened as he leans over the front of the counter and goes--
-SAM-
I'm going to look like just a gnome.
-MATT-
Okay. Just a gnome. The rest of you keeping it as is?
-LIAM-
Hood up and I'm still dirty as sin.
-TALIESIN-
I think I've still got a little bit of time on my shaggy redhead. Wait, no. Am I out now?
-MATT-
Most of the illusions you had in the city have faded at this time since you've been traversing the exterior.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going <i>au natural.</i>
-LAURA-
Yeah, same.
-MARISHA-
I'm going to button up and go full Cobalt colors.
-MATT-
You got it. Anyway, Simone leans forward and goes, "Why hello there! What can I do for you? You looking for rooms for the night?"
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
"How many is that? Book a room each?"
-TRAVIS-
Four rooms? Three?
-LAURA-
Three rooms, I think, should do it.
-MATT-
"How many?"
-LAURA-
Three.
-MATT-
"Three? Three rooms, all right. Well, we got plenty of space with events being as they have been. That'll put you back about, let's say one gold, one silver for the three?"
-LAURA-
That sounds like a very good deal. Thank you so much.
-MATT-
"All right, no worries."
-LAURA-
Yeah, I'll pay for it.
-MATT-
Fumbles through some keys and passes them out to you. "Feel free to distribute as need be.
If you need anything, let me know."
-TRAVIS-
You said with events being as they have been. We noticed there's been a ruckus recently.
-MATT-
"Yeah, you could say that. You could say that. I mean, 'ruckus' is a word."
-TRAVIS-
Calm the last few days? Any reason why we should be apprehensive this evening?
-MATT-
"I certainly hope not. We've kind of seen kind of the craziest thing Felderwin's ever seen in most of its history since war with the Dominion. So I sincerely hope not. I mean, it's one less competitive inn, but poor Jer. I just feel bad for everyone that lost their homes and businesses in that affair. It's not good."
-TRAVIS-
I understand. The aftermath, we saw troops leaving on our way in.
-MATT-
"Yeah, they've been here a few weeks just walking around. Just in case they came back."
-TRAVIS-
They catch any of those that were guilty of all this?
-MATT-
"No. They came in without warning. Just tore through, burned things and left."
-LAURA-
We were hoping to buy some potions while we were here. Do you know if there's a good alchemy shop or anything around?
-MATT-
"Yeah, see, the only real alchemist around here was one of the homesteads that burned down, unfortunately."
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
"But there's the Crossroads not too far from here; big trading post in the middle of the Marrow Valley." Which you've been to before.
"That's probably your best bet."
-LAURA-
Do you know? The alchemy shop, what was the name of it?
-MATT-
"Oh, that was the Brenatto Apothecary."
-LAURA-
Brenatto Apo-- Do you know if this Brenatto is around, still?
-MATT-
"Last I heard, Brenatto went missing. Could probably ask the crownsguard. I don't think they've updated anything. But--"
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
"Most of the folks here got killed in the fire, so might best ask them."
-TALIESIN-
Crownsguard is probably our best bet if some of the people we're looking for happen to be still missing in the aftermath, then?
-MATT-
"I can imagine."
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LAURA-
Great.
-TRAVIS-
Appreciate ya.
-MATT-
"No worries. We have two meals here: one shortly after dusk; and bright and early in the morning, right after sunup. You got about an hour window. If you miss it, well, there's plenty of-- Should be plenty of food amongst the city to find, so good luck."
-LAURA-
Did we miss the meal already today, then?
-MATT-
"Nah, you've still got a few hours before sundown, so just come on by and go ahead and get me and my wife cooking."
-TALIESIN-
This is going to sound weird, but is there a florist around? Or anybody who deals with exotics? Exotic herbs, plants, or otherwise.
-MATT-
"You mean herbs and spices? Yeah. I mean, there's Felderwin General has all manner of various flavorings if that's what you're looking for."
-TALIESIN-
Something exciting.
-MATT-
"Yeah. Felderwin's not known for its excitement, necessarily. But keep your eye out.
Who knows what you'll find with the right questions, I don't know. I've seen some wild folk come in these doors in my days, I'll tell you that much. Not all as colorful as you, though.
So can't say my experiences are a good basis of comparison, if you catch my drift."
-TALIESIN-
I'm looking forward to a little quiet.
-MATT-
"You and me both. Now all them soldiers are out of here at least. I'm going to miss the coinage, but I ain't going to miss the riff-raff."
-TRAVIS-
Thank you.
-MATT-
"Yeah, no worries. I'll see you around dinner time, then."
-LAURA-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
Ducey. A florist?
-TALIESIN-
I need something. It's nice to have something complicated to use to focus myself.
-MARISHA-
Complicated? Is that what you said?
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-LAURA-
(puffing)
-TALIESIN-
Not quite, but yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh, really? I was joking.
-SAM-
Like tea?
-MARISHA-
Poppy seeds?
-TALIESIN-
Anything. Preferably some sort of flower or living plant but if it's--
-MARISHA-
Chamomile? Black-eyed Susans?
-TRAVIS-
Stop.
-TALIESIN-
The notion is, I'm looking for something that is a testament to the abilities of the Wildmother, so anything that is a gift from her to us. Something impressive, something beautiful, something tasty.
-LAURA-
Honey!
-TALIESIN-
I've never tried honey. I don't know if it would work, but that's interesting.
-MARISHA-
I mean, it's essence of flower and bee puke. It's a miracle.
-TALIESIN-
I usually tend to stick a little closer to the source. I also don't really necessarily know how I would perform the ritual with honey.
-LIAM-
I have a decent amount of molasses, if you like.
-TALIESIN-
I honestly don't know the difference between molasses and honey.
-LIAM-
Well, one is the bee poop; but molasses comes out of a tree.
-TALIESIN-
Tree poop and bee poop.
-MARISHA-
Well, it's more of a-- it's fine.
-TRAVIS-
Let it ride.
-SAM-
I have some tobacco.
-TALIESIN-
That might be interesting, but I think I should probably see if there's anything around, possibly.
-MARISHA-
I have this red feather from Nila.
She was also a firbolg.
-TALIESIN-
I'm not sure how that relates, but that is a very beautiful feather.
-MARISHA-
Well. Yeah, that's fair.
-MATT-
If you'd like to, make an investigation check to wander about the town to see if you can manage to muster some supplies.
-SAM-
I can give him some advice on places to look.
-MATT-
Actually, you would-- yeah. Take some advantage on that.
-TALIESIN-
Do you want to roll? Okay, no. I'll roll it because my investigation is amazing.
Here we go. Come on. Ah! That's a natural 20.
That brings me to a-- that's a 19, then.
-MATT-
Felderwin would be one of the few places in the empire where the Wildmother would be very popular if she weren't outlawed, and you get the sense that there might even be an unspoken worship to her amongst this very rural farming community.
-TALIESIN-
I'm hoping to find an orchid or something. Something interesting.
-MATT-
You manage to go to both Felderwin General and, with Nott's help, sneak into one of the elaborate specialty herb-growing boxes, specifically for the purpose of various medicinal herbs. We'll say, over the period of the next 30 minutes or so, you gather what would be about 25 gold worth of--
-TALIESIN-
It's as if you knew what I was doing.
Thank you. (laughs) Thank you, and here goes 25 gold. That's all I needed to do, really.
That was my pre-game.
-MATT-
Okay. Anyone else got anything?
-SAM-
This is not nighttime yet, we're just--
-MATT-
No, but you're getting closer.
-LAURA-
We're keeping an eye out for any cloaked, robed elven people. Yeah, we're trying to avoid them.
-MARISHA-
Would Nott know of a general physician, a doctor? Someone?
-SAM-
I mean, we have one with us-- two with us.
-MARISHA-
Local doctor.
-SAM-
<i>Local</i> doctor.
-TRAVIS-
That might know locals?
-SAM-
Oh, someone who might have repaired one of the soldiers or something like that?
-MARISHA-
It said in those papers about them being sick from the-- the town complaining about sluggishness.
-MATT-
You do know there is a female human physician in the town. There's a number of physicians and people, but there is one named Demi Leric, who is the altruistic member of the community. Doesn't charge, but accepts donations and is often the first to try and help out those of the more meager lifestyle in this farming community.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Demi Leric, you say.
-SAM-
Dr. Demi Leric, medicine woman.
-MATT-
(laughs) More or less. Sure.
-LAURA-
I also want to find a crownsguard.
-MATT-
Easy enough to find as you're glancing around because they're fairly present and conversing. You see one set of three that are walking past. The one seems most energetic in conversation is in the process of regaling the other two with some inane tale.
Scrawny, human-looking fellow, looking like he's mid-30s or so, chin scruff, but can't quite grow a full beard. Like me, apparently.
-LAURA-
You have a lovely, full beard, Matthew.
-MATT-
I'm still getting used to it.
-TRAVIS-
(whisper) Come forth! Come forth!
-LAURA-
(explosion) I'll split off from the group so that I'm not drawing attention. Excuse me?
-MATT-
"Hey. Yeah, can I help you?"
-LAURA-
Yeah, I'm staying at the local inn right now. I have a friend. He's losing a little bit of his hair, and he was hoping-- <i>I</i> was hoping for a present I could get him, maybe a potion that would grow it? Do you know where I could find somebody that could grow hair, a potion maker or something?
-MATT-
"Can't say I'm too familiar with hair tonics, per se."
-LAURA-
I don't know what kind of potions can be made. Do you know?
-MATT-
"If you're looking for anything too fancy, I'd probably recommend heading on to Zadash."
-LAURA-
Okay, okay. What about alchemy? Is there a local alchemist or something?
-MATT-
"Not anymore, unfortunately."
-LAURA-
No?
-MATT-
"That was one of the buildings we lost to the cricks a few weeks back."
-LAURA-
Oh no! The building is gone; what about the person that ran the shop?
-MATT-
"Hell if I know. Cricks ran in here and started killing people left and right and left in the same hour they arrived. It was like a swift nightmare, tearing through here."
-LAURA-
That's insane. I've never seen a crick.
What do they look like?
-MATT-
"Let me tell you, did you ever have one of them terrible dreams where something comes out of the darkness and tries to grab at you and cut at you? It's burning eyes of evil and dark armor of shadow and nothing?"
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm?
-MATT-
"Well, imagine a bunch of them popping out of the ground and cutting down your friends--"
-LAURA-
How did they pop out of the ground?
-MATT-
"Hell if I know! A bunch of ground-dwelling, weird, dark elf folk."
-LAURA-
Did you have to fight them?
-MATT-
"Well, I fought a number of them myself, trying to protect my buddies here, but not everyone was so lucky."
-LAURA-
You must be so brave.
-MATT-
"Oh, no. Just--"
-LAURA-
I mean, you look really brave.
-MATT-
"I'm just doing my job, ma'am."
-LAURA-
Wow! Well, all right. I guess I'll have to go to another town for a potion. Can you point me in the direction of this shop?
-MATT-
"The one that was here?"
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
"That's right over-- you go head down two blocks and to the right, follow that on for about seven, eight or so buildings on the left. It's hard to miss. It's the second one on the left that's burned down."
-LAURA-
Okay. Hey, maybe the owner ran away or something, right?
-MATT-
"Here's to hoping."
-LAURA-
Yeah. Fingers crossed!
-MATT-
"Indeed."
-LAURA-
(sighing)
-MATT-
Is there anything else you're looking to find out?
-LAURA-
No, I just wanted to see if they saw him leaving the town. That's all.
-MATT-
You'd probably have to find somebody who was a little more in the thick of it.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That soldier was totally hitting on you.
-LAURA-
A lot of soldiers hit on me. It's no big deal.
-TALIESIN-
He wasn't even here when the fighting happened. He was lying. Sorry. So brave. Sorry.
-MATT-
Anyone else want anything?
-MARISHA-
I want to find Demi Leric.
-MATT-
Okay. It takes you a little while. Not too long with Nott's help guiding you in that direction, but finding the right building-- because the sign itself that has Demi Leric's name on it is itself smoke-covered from-- it's across the street from one of the buildings that was damaged by the fire. As you walk over towards the edge, the door is partially ajar.
-MARISHA-
(knocking)
-MATT-
"Wait just a minute! Now sit down. It's going to hurt a bit longer. Come in!" You open the door, come inside. It's a very simple establishment. Immediately the smell hits you of various smells like medicinal herbs and very strong chemicals. You see four, five cots that are set up, two of which have recovering townsguard that are bandaged up and currently laying down.
One of them appears to be asleep. The other one is sitting there with a fresh set of bandages put over burns. You see Demi turn around. Human woman, maybe late 20s, early 30s or so, heavyset, bright smile, bright eyes, but sleeves rolled to the elbows and all business. She turns around, and the fingers are hit with whatever material was used to apply the burn bandages to the one soldier. She wipes her hands, this viscous oil-like substance, and wipes them on a cloth. "Well, can I help you?"
-MARISHA-
Hi, yes. I'm Beauregard of the Cobalt Soul. I've been sent here from Zadash.
-MATT-
"All right."
-MARISHA-
If you have a few minutes, I would love to ask you a few questions.
-MATT-
"Certainly. Feel free to go and ask."
-MARISHA-
We're taking statements from people, trying to figure out some incongruencies that might have been happening over the past few months.
-MATT-
"Incongruency, all right."
-MARISHA-
Did you ever notice any increased amount of patients feeling sick, sluggish, anything off?
-MATT-
"Well, I mean, they're pretty sluggish right now, but that's for obvious reasons." MARISHA:. Not the most recent two weeks, burnt-in-a-fire-type of off. Before then.
"We've had a few strange complaints maybe about a month, two months ago. Just a wave of general, a nauseous-- I assumed it was maybe some bad food that got through a bit. Wasn't too serious."
-MARISHA-
Wave of nausea? Anything else? What makes you think that they were related, as opposed to general food poisoning? What was strange about them?
-MATT-
"It was a bunch of people complaining about the same thing in a very short period of time.
I assumed maybe it was related."
-MARISHA-
Did they all happen to live in a similar area of town?
-MATT-
"Yeah, they were all in a cluster right in this region, which is why they all came to me."
-MARISHA-
All in a cluster. Sorry, just taking notes, just want to make sure I get everything correct.
-MATT-
"Yeah, no worries."
-MARISHA-
Okay. Anything else that seems like it might spark your memory of being a little bit odd?
-MATT-
"I mean, the town was attacked, and people were killed and burned. That's strange."
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm. Did you know a man by the name of Yeza?
-MATT-
"Yeah, he was right down the street."
-MARISHA-
Did he come in around that time with the batch of people who were feeling nauseous?
-MATT-
"No. To be honest, I was busy trying to treat who I could. That was not a good day."
-MARISHA-
It was all one day?
-MATT-
"One night, really. Around midnight.
Suddenly buildings were up in flames, people were screaming. I looked out there, and there were cricks running through the street."
-MARISHA-
Do you mind if I talk to a few of your patients for a second?
-MATT-
"Be my guest."
-MARISHA-
If you think of anything, if you remember anything-- I don't have a card, but I'm staying-- I'll be in town. I might be back.
-MATT-
"Great. Well, if you think of any other questions, feel free to ask."
-MARISHA-
Thank you, miss.
-SAM-
Next time on Colum-Beau.
-MATT-
What was the part where she then goes, "And one more thing..."
-SAM-
"One more question." (multiple Columbo impressions)
-MATT-
For our younger audience: Columbo was a television series.
-MARISHA-
Okay, I'm going to go over to one of the guards.
-MATT-
Okay, there is one that appears to be asleep, who looks to be a little more combat wounded. The one that's semi-conscious is mostly burns.
-MARISHA-
Is the one who's semi-conscious conscious enough to speak?
-MATT-
He seems to be. He's sitting there going (pained breathing).
-MARISHA-
I go up and slap one of his wounds.
-MATT-
(pained yelling) "What is wrong with you?! Who are you?!"
-MARISHA-
'Sup? Name's Beau. With the Cobalt Soul.
-MATT-
"Great!"
-MARISHA-
Yeah. What's your name?
-MATT-
"Jeff." (laughter)
-SAM-
Yeah, well, it's spelled weird. G-E-O-F-F.
-MATT-
He's got two apostrophes between the Fs.
-LIAM-
The umlaut's over the second F.
-MATT-
Look, man. Not everyone in a fantasy setting has awesome names.
-MARISHA-
Good to meet you, Jeff. You patrol the cluster normally?
-MATT-
"Yeah, when I'm not laid up like this."
-MARISHA-
You look pretty badly burned, obviously.
-MATT-
"Yeah, no. That's why I was really appreciating your entrance there.
Very thoughtful."
-MARISHA-
I give him a little bit of my wine from my wine pouch.
-MATT-
"I accept your recompense."
-MARISHA-
Sorry.
-MATT-
At this point, Demi's like, "Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!"
-MARISHA-
Sorry, Demi, sorry.
-MATT-
"He's already had enough."
-MARISHA-
Jeff, I was curious if you happened to know what happened to Yeza Ber-de-ger-de-ger--?
-TRAVIS-
Brenatto?
-MARISHA-
Brenatto, or if you were around when the apothecary burned.
-MATT-
"Yeah. That's where I got all this."
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-MATT-
"Was trying to get people out of the flames.
Managed to get his son out, it seems."
-MARISHA-
Really?
-MATT-
"Yeah. Cricks got him and ran."
-MARISHA-
The cricks got him?
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-MARISHA-
Did you see which direction they ran?
-MATT-
"Back to the fucking hole. They headed northward."
-MARISHA-
You're sure it was the cricks?
-MATT-
"Yeah! Was four of them."
-MARISHA-
Okay. Did you see anything else?
-MATT-
"Yeah, I saw the fire they pushed me into when I tried to stop them!"
-MARISHA-
You were the one who got Luke out?
-MATT-
"Well, me and two others, but they didn't, you know, fare as poorly as I did."
-MARISHA-
All right. Anything else you remember, anything spark in your mind trying to figure this shit out? I know that's vague.
-MATT-
"Yeah. Yeah it is. I mean, it was crazy.
They came in quick.
Fires were set before we knew what was happening."
-MARISHA-
Did you feel like they were looking for something in particular? Were they targeting places?
-MATT-
"I guess? The last place they lit was the apothecary."
-MARISHA-
Okay. Well, look; you did a good thing, all right, man? You saved a kid.
-MATT-
"Thanks?"
-MARISHA-
My friend's kid. I don't really care about the kid, but it was my friend's kid, so...
here. I pull out 20 gold, throw it on the table.
-MATT-
His eyes go wide.
-MARISHA-
You can split that up with your friends, or if you want to keep it, I don't really give a fuck.
-MATT-
"So you're from the Cobalt Soul?"
-MARISHA-
Yep! Bye! Then I run away.
-MATT-
Perfect.
-LAURA-
Traci?
-LIAM-
Hey, Laura. Hey, Laura. That's a pretty good penis you drew over there. It's very lifelike.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god, it's big!
-LAURA-
Sam told me to!
-TRAVIS-
Did you hear what was revealed in that moment just now?
-MARISHA-
It's coming from the depths.
-LIAM-
Looks like some stuff happened there, too.
-SAM-
This is serious, guys.
-MATT-
Anybody else doing anything before you guys reconvene? Is there anything else you want to look for, or are you ready to gather?
-LAURA-
It feels like we're supposed to do something.
-MATT-
No, I'm just curious. If you've completed your investigation--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, oh! Is there a furniture maker in town? Because I really would like to ask them questions about that chair.
-SAM-
My husband is missing!
-TALIESIN-
I'm done, I'm done! I'm good. This is my attempt to rally everybody. It worked. I swear.
Don't look at me like that, jesus.
Oh god, there's just dicks over there, I don't know what to do.
-MATT-
There's no escape, Taliesin.
There's no escaping.
-TALIESIN-
Just potential dicks, now. That's better.
-MARISHA-
Just potential dicks.
-LAURA-
Yeah. The opportunities...
-TRAVIS-
Are there specific areas where the tunnels were collapsed after they went back in and covered them up?
-MATT-
You can go look if you want to.
-SAM-
Yeah, we should look.
-MARISHA-
Are we meeting back up?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we should meet up and then search.
-MARISHA-
All right, meet back up. I kick down the door and I go: Apparently he was taken by cricks! Then I fill them in.
-SAM-
Wait, he was?
-LAURA-
Can we call them Kryn, please?
-LAURA-
That's what they actually are.
-MARISHA-
Apparently he was taken by Kryn!
-SAM-
He was taken by Kryn? Not by--
-MARISHA-
I talked to some soldier boy named Jeff.
-SAM-
Weird name.
-MARISHA-
I know, right? His parents must not have loved him.
-LAURA-
I think Jeff's a really nice name.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, a lot of Jeffs right now are fucking giving you the bird.
-MATT-
Jeff's a great name, that's why I used it.
-LAURA-
Jeff is a great name. Keep going.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, keep digging.
-SAM-
Tell me what Jeff fucking said!
-MARISHA-
He said four Kryn came in, scooped up your husband, and ran off.
-SAM-
Wait, he saw that happen?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, he was there. He ran in and he saved your son.
-SAM-
Well, shit, this changes everything.
-LAURA-
Wait, wait, wait. What is the possibility that your mean people can change memories?
-LIAM-
Pretty good.
-TALIESIN-
Still, we should at least investigate this lead now, and tomorrow, if we don't know what's going on, I can-- and I warn you, I will do this, but I'm going to get a little exhausted doing it-- I can at least give us some sense of what's ahead.
-LAURA-
Should I try to send him a message and see if he responds?
-TRAVIS-
Couldn't hurt.
-SAM-
It could definitely hurt. If she sends a message and he's with the Rexxentrum folks--
-LAURA-
Would they know?
-SAM-
They might be able to sense that.
-LIAM-
Are you talking about what Nott and I do or what you do?
-LAURA-
What I do.
-LIAM-
That's between you and your god, Jester.
-TRAVIS-
Can't they respond to your messages?
-LAURA-
Well, yeah, but I can say, "Don't respond if you're by anybody that, you know--"
-TRAVIS-
Or "If you're alive, just say ow"?
-LAURA-
Oh, that's good. What if I do that?
-SAM-
Why don't we try Mr. Clay's idea first? See if he's alive and then we'll try to send a message.
-TALIESIN-
Let's take a look at these tunnels. I'm actually very curious about this.
-TRAVIS-
We'll go find a nearby crownsguard and see if they can point us in the direction of where some of those collapsed tunnels were.
-MATT-
Okay. So you heading to the tunnel first?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
Is it dark yet?
-MATT-
By this point, you guys gathering, yeah, dusk has happened. You can eat first or miss your meal.
-LAURA-
We only have an hour. We need to get our free food.
-TALIESIN-
We'll get a little food and then we'll check it out by night.
-MATT-
The meal is actually quite fresh.
Being a farm town, it's nothing fancy, but everything's hearty and quite delectable. Heading your way outside of Felderwin, to the northeast side where it begins to border on the Tillage itself, there's a group of about eight crownsguard that are circled around three-- what would have been the exit burrows. From this distance, you can see it's like a sinkhole. It's caved in a bit.
From this distance, you can't see any further than a few inches to indicate that that seems to be where it was, and the guards are keeping a perimeter just in case anything were to return.
-TRAVIS-
I'll walk up. Excuse me!
-MATT-
As you approach he's like, "Hi, can I help you?"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, sorry, we're just passing by.
We heard this was the scene of all the unfortunateness.
-MATT-
"Yeah, that's what I hear, too."
-TRAVIS-
Has it been cased, this area? Searched for, I don't know, anything left over by the invading hordes?
-MATT-
"As far as I know. I'm just stationed here, but they've been looking this thing up and down for two, almost three weeks now."
-TRAVIS-
Who's they?
-MATT-
"The guard, the Righteous Brand. Some of them fancy folk from Rexxentrum."
-TRAVIS-
Fancy?
-MATT-
"Yeah, I mean, they're all fucking fancy from up there, but some of them elvish people."
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I think I saw them.
What were they doing?
-MATT-
"I don't fucking know. They don't talk to me."
-TRAVIS-
Fair enough. You know if they found anything, took anything out of the dirt?
-MATT-
"No."
-TRAVIS-
They tell you that these might open up again, or they might be in imminent peril? I see there's eight of you guys.
-MATT-
"I certainly hope not. From what I can tell, wasn't just the cricks." Then one of the other guys, one of the soldiers, goes like, "I was here. I saw it."
-TRAVIS-
You were here?
-MATT-
"Yeah, no, I mean, they didn't dig them.
Something dug it for them."
-TRAVIS-
Is that right?
-MATT-
"It was a big old mouth made of teeth just carved out of the ground and then withdrew, and then they poured out."
-TRAVIS-
My god, that sounds terrible.
-MATT-
"Yeah, yeah! I hate this job."
-TRAVIS-
When you saw the big mouth with teeth? What'd you do?
-MATT-
"Fucking ran! What do you think I'm going to do?"
-TRAVIS-
Damn right, fast as you could I'll bet.
-MATT-
The other guys look at him, like (scoffing) and he's like, "What?! You would've done the same!"
-LAURA-
Was it like a worm or something?
-MATT-
"Something like that, yeah."
-TRAVIS-
Did it come out of the ground or did it go back in after?
-MATT-
"No, it broke through but just came out a few feet, and then it pulled back in.
We were like, 'What the fuck is that?' Then the cricks came running out."
-LAURA-
Do you think the Kryn came out of the worm thing?
-MATT-
"I mean, it's possible."
-TRAVIS-
How big was this creature?
-MATT-
"I don't know, it was big. From what I saw it was maybe, I don't know, ten feet wide?"
-TRAVIS-
Wow, that's significant. Were you also here or far away when they made their hasty retreat?
-MATT-
"I was over there." He points off maybe a hundred or so feet away.
-TRAVIS-
Keeping an eye out?
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-TRAVIS-
Could you see anything that was driving them off or were they just taking their sweet time as they left?
-MATT-
At this point the other, first guard you were talking to goes, "Hey, what's your business here, anyway?"
-TRAVIS-
We've come across these cricks before. We saw them in Zadash. There was a big ruckus in the middle of the city. Trying to learn all we can.
I don't know when we'll come across them next.
I feel like share and share alike, you know?
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-TRAVIS-
16.
-MATT-
He nods for a second and goes, "All right, so, I guess have a look around. It's already been given the once-over many times, so take a moment if you need it."
-SAM-
Has anyone gone down and followed the tunnels?
-MATT-
He points over the third one and he goes, "They've been digging that one for about two weeks, but eventually gave up."
-TRAVIS-
Why'd they stop?
-MATT-
"They collapsed them behind them and there's only so much you can go. If they dug all the way from Xhorhas, do you have any idea how long those tunnels would go for?"
-TRAVIS-
Pretty long.
-MATT-
"Don't really have that kind of manpower here in Felderwin. The soldiers all left, so I'm not going to keep digging."
-TRAVIS-
I appreciate it. We won't take up much of your time. We thought we'd have a gander around, if that's all right.
-MATT-
"Eh, go for it. How many you got?"
-LAURA-
Seven?
-MATT-
"And you're all investigating?"
-LAURA-
Some of us are just hanging out.
-TALIESIN-
It wasn't our intention, but things being what they are, this seems to be the new reality of the world, doesn't it?
-MATT-
"All right, just no funny business.
I'll be keeping an eye on you."
-TRAVIS-
Fair enough. Being that fancy folk were here, I don't suppose there's any point in doing our particular brand of searching.
-LAURA-
I have a question. When you Blink out-- I haven't done it very much, but I feel like it's the Ethereal Plane, right, that we go to?
-TRAVIS-
The what?
-LAURA-
The Ethereal Plane?
-TRAVIS-
What is that?
-LAURA-
It's another plane.
The Traveler told me about it.
-TRAVIS-
I don't talk to The Traveler.
-LAURA-
Oh. Well, I feel like we go to this other plane, right? You can walk through things on that plane, because it's not quite the same. So what if we Blinked, and then we could go through where they collapsed the tunnel? Then we could be in the tunnel and just see, you know? Then come back!
-TRAVIS-
That's a good idea, except for what if the whole tunnel's collapsed and we Blink into the earth?
-LAURA-
Well, I don't think you can do that. Right?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, I imagine anything is possible in this world of magic and mystery, but I bet it would hurt a lot.
-LAURA-
You can't Blink if the spot is taken up, right?
-MATT-
I would say if you were attempting to Blink into a solid space, it would shunt you out of the space and you would take a little bit of force damage. General rules for shifting out of ethereal space into matter.
-LAURA-
I'm not trying to Dimension Door.
That one scares me a bit.
-TRAVIS-
I don't know about you, but when I Blink, I can only appear about ten feet from where I previously was.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's what I mean! We Blink right here. Then we walk where the tunnel was and we go into the tunnel.
-TALIESIN-
I can walk through stone.
-LAURA-
Or we could just do that.
-TRAVIS-
That's better.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, I'd want to know where I was going, and I can only go alone.
-LIAM-
I'm no expert on worms, but I would imagine that it is more collapsed earth than open space.
-TALIESIN-
I would imagine so as well.
-LIAM-
They chew their way their way through the earth and poop out the remains.
-TALIESIN-
Just honey all the way back.
-MARISHA-
So much nature poop.
-SAM-
So our choices are--?
-TALIESIN-
We should have this conversation in here, because I want to take a look around in this thing.
-SAM-
In the tunnel?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, they offered us.
-TRAVIS-
It's sunken earth, right?
-MATT-
You approach and see there are three tunnels, and they're scattered maybe 300 feet apart from each other, approximately. Between 200 and 300 feet. The first one you're at here sinks in about ten, 15 feet; and it looks like crumbled stone and earth with patches of fresh dirt, and the roots that were upended as it tore through folding over onto the pile. It looks like it's been left as it was. You go over and inspect the other one and the same guard and few others walk with you to keep a close eye. The one in the middle, this is the one that's been dug out.
It's just pitch black below.
-TALIESIN-
Light.
-MATT-
Okay, you cast Light. The soldiers take a step back as soon as they see you make a gesture and brightness seems to appear.
-TALIESIN-
It's all in the stone.
-MATT-
Yeah. The tunnel goes straight down. Well, close to straight down. It comes at a fairly steep incline. There is a rope affixed to a heavy wooden pike that's been banged into the ground.
Do you head down inside?
-TALIESIN-
I mean, yeah. Unless anybody's got an objection.
-TRAVIS-
Nope. Oh, you're doing your walk thing.
-TALIESIN-
No, I'm just walking.
-MATT-
Your walk, technically, can only go something that's five feet inward.
You can't just glide through stone.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, is that true? Oh. I didn't know that. Well, I don't have that as an option right now, anyway.
-MATT-
There you go. You head down inside, and off to the side of it there's a small pile of dirt and rock. It looks like a lot of it has been moved off of the premises for the time being. As you head down and continue to walk, it evens out. It probably descends to a depth of about 50 or 60 feet below and continues at a steady decline on for about another-- as you continue to walk, continuing to walk, you get to a full close to 200 feet in before it comes to an ending point.
There's a few carts at the base carrying dirt and rock up. You can see shovels and pickaxes and all sorts of materials that have been left behind by the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel.
-TALIESIN-
There's no marking on it? This is an obviously organically-carved tunnel?
-MATT-
Looks to be, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
The footprints going in and out, there's nothing--
-MATT-
Make a survival check.
-TALIESIN-
Wow. Never really done one of those. 19.
-MATT-
Okay. There are all sorts of footprints in here. There have been soldiers and crownsguard and all sorts of people in and out of this tunnel. You can see cart tracks and everything, but you can definitely tell that the edges of the top of the tunnel have a smoother, natural carving to them, whatever creature it is definitely burrowed. With that roll, I'd say you do make out a few footsteps that resemble more armored boots that are more unique against the profile of the general crownsguard and/or Righteous Brand soldiers.
-TALIESIN-
In both directions?
-MATT-
In both directions.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Interesting. Very interesting. They were definitely in here and they definitely left this way.
-TRAVIS-
Any reason to use your radar and see if anything was missed?
-TALIESIN-
My radar? What do you mean?
-TRAVIS-
Anything magical. Anything arcane.
-TALIESIN-
Detect Magic.
-MATT-
Okay. Nothing in the vicinity catches your attention, unfortunately.
-TALIESIN-
Nothing, really. Just for fun, because we can, Eyes of the Grave, too. Just for fun.
-MATT-
Okay. Nothing catches your attention there either.
-TALIESIN-
No? I figured. Nothing.
-SAM-
So we could continue following this tunnel for several hundred miles and see where it goes, or we could take my son to Alfield, or we could head to Rexxentrum and start tracking down Caleb's old teachers.
-TRAVIS-
They're still here.
-SAM-
They are? I thought they bamfed out.
-LIAM-
We don't know. We don't really know.
-TRAVIS-
No, they bamfed in. Didn't see them leave.
-LIAM-
Yeah, but they can do that in a basement.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but we can kill them too.
-SAM-
I'm all for it. What do we do?
-MARISHA-
I feel like we shouldn't try and assassinate the head of the Cerberus Assembly; not right now, maybe.
-LAURA-
This is overwhelming!
-TRAVIS-
Just as a warm up. All right?
-SAM-
Do we know anyone who can help us?
-MARISHA-
We just made an alliance, sort of, with Yussa.
-LAURA-
Yussa's pretty powerful.
-SAM-
We can't get back there for weeks.
-TALIESIN-
We could message.
-LAURA-
I could send him a message!
-MARISHA-
We could also go back to Zadash.
-SAM-
We know folks there.
-LAURA-
Yeah, we do.
-TALIESIN-
In the morning, and I can't guarantee this, but we'll at least know if he's alive and maybe a sense of whether or not he's above ground or below ground and that'll certainly inform our decision.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Maybe. I'll glean what I can but, it's a soft process.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Do we want to abandon this tunnel? I can jump forward 90 feet in a direction.
-LAURA-
If you bamf forward and there is stuff blocking the way, will you get really hurt?
-TRAVIS-
I don't know. I think I'll get shunted out.
-MARISHA-
Are you talking about the thundery one that's real loud?
-LAURA-
That's a little different.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, that one.
-LAURA-
Right?
-MARISHA-
It won't collapse the tunnel on our heads when you do it, will it?
-SAM-
Or we could just walk 90 feet ahead.
-LAURA-
The tunnel is blocked.
-SAM-
Oh, okay.
-LAURA-
About 200 feet in, the tunnel is blocked.
-LIAM-
We have no idea how deep the blockage goes.
-MATT-
Just so you're aware, Thunder Step, as most teleportation effects, you have to teleport to a location you can see.
-TRAVIS-
In my mind's eye!
-MATT-
I mean, if you want to get real crazy, roll the dice!
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to try something really quickly, just for fun. I'm going to use Thaumaturgy really quickly and I'm going to broadcast a low bass chant and I'm going to throw it as far forward down that tunnel as I possibly can to see if I can get some sort of vibration coming back that they can hear. I'm going to start throwing this (low bass humming).
If there's air to vibrate or I'm making sound in solid rock as a boosting of your-- It may not work.
-MATT-
I see what you're doing.
-TALIESIN-
Trying to use some sort of nature theory here.
-MATT-
That's interesting. It's a cantrip, so there's definite limitations on its ability.
-SAM-
It's the most powerful spell.
-LAURA-
I use Thaumaturgy and I'm like: Whoa, that's really cool! Did you see it? There's a bunch of whispers of people going, "That's so cool!"
-TALIESIN-
You can get really loud. That's the question, is can I get loud enough to hear myself like if I was trapped in there? Or am I-- yeah.
-MATT-
I'll say two things: One, roll just a straight wisdom check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Straight wisdom check. 13.
-MATT-
13, okay. You close your eyes and focus, feeling your feet connecting with the earth below you, letting the Wildmother's power suffuse your torso, your abdomen, your legs, and your feet into the earth below as you begin to release that low vibration. The hum carries through your body and into rock below and the vibration carries into the ground and due to the nature of this cavern you're in, it echoes pretty loudly in this space. You all can gently feel it and the guards in the back start looking around a bit nervous, not quite sure what's happening. One of them runs off afraid.
He's like, "It's going to collapse!"
-LAURA-
I'm picturing like a didgeridoo.
-MATT-
You've run it for awhile, you've cast the vibration into the rock. What are you going to do to try and listen for?
-TALIESIN-
Honestly? I'm going to try and see and cut it off to see if there's an echo coming through the rocks, basically, in that split second.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TALIESIN-
Into it! 18.
-MATT-
You immediately rush up to edge of where the stone is, the most solid piece of it that's on that side and listen. You feel like you can very vaguely hear what might be gap a ways in at some point. You're not sure how far away it might be and you're not sure how big the gap may be.
It could be just a small pocket, it could be a continuation of the tunnel, but there does appear to be some minor element of vibration that carried through with some differentiation.
-TALIESIN-
How deep are we underground right now?
-MATT-
At the full end of this tunnel? I'd say you're about 80 or so feet deep.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, cool. I'm just going to do that.
I'm not going to inform anybody of anything that just happened and be like: Okay, I'm good.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you for that.
-MATT-
As you guys gather your thoughts, and march back to the inn in the evening air over Felderwin, we're going to take a break.
-ALL-
Woo!
-MATT-
We're going to be right back here in a few minutes. In the interim, we have our fantastic friends at Wyrmwood's Wyrmwood giveaway! Run, run like the wind.
-SAM-
She's running. She has to go do the other D&amp;D streaming show that she's on.
-MATT-
Exactly.
-TALIESIN-
Wow. That was good.
-MATT-
This is Bolivian rosewood. Nice leather interior there, really nice dice box going to one of our friends out there. For you guys wanting to enter this drawing at the break, head on over to the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the key phrase "tension." T-E-N-S-I-O-N.
-SAM-
How did you know?
-MATT-
I don't know, it's like last week ended with a lot of tension. Enter it once; more than once you'll be disqualified, and unfortunately due to giveaway rules, only people in the US and Canada excluding Quebec can enter. We'll have a winner when we return, so see you guys here in a few minutes.
-TRAVIS-
Damn!
-SAM-
Wow!
-MATT-
Welcome back. Before we jump back in, we have a winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.
The winner tonight is palingratz. Palingratz, congratulations! We'll get that sent to you ASAP, and we'll have our next giveaway next week. As you all return back to the tavern where you're staying, the Goldfield Tavern and Lodge, you gather your thoughts and yourselves in your respective chambers. What would you like to do?
-SAM-
Shit, we should have talked about this during the fucking break.
-TRAVIS-
Nope, that would have been out of form for us. No. We don't do that.
-SAM-
What do we do?
-LIAM-
We plan everything.
-TRAVIS-
Yes, of course.
-TALIESIN-
I tried to get a sense if there was something beyond that.
I don't know, I got a hint of something.
-TRAVIS-
You did?
-TALIESIN-
I think maybe there's something past that wall.
-SAM-
Oh, in the tunnel? You're not talking about my husband who I want to know if he's alive or not?
-TALIESIN-
I can't know that until dawn. If we do decide to go that direction, I think that there is definitely a chance that we could dig far enough and deep enough to make passage.
-MARISHA-
Guys. Hot take. The Kryn aren't the bad guys.
-SAM-
That is a hot take. It's funny that you said that because-- and it may have been because I was not drunk at the time. I was thinking, when you were talking, Caleb, or Bren, about Rexxentrum and how it's heavily protected and guarded, and how it's impossible to get in and make an assault on it, I immediately thought, well, what if we went in with the Kryn and attacked with them?
-LIAM-
To do...?
-TRAVIS-
Are you talking about aligning ourselves with the people that ganked your husband?
-SAM-
I don't know that they've ganked him.
First of all, he might be dead.
-TALIESIN-
We'll know tomorrow.
-SAM-
He might be ganked, but he might not be ganked by who we think ganked him.
-MARISHA-
I mean, aside from the mind-altering magic that we've already mentioned, all of us can change our appearance. Maybe what you're talking about, about them coming in and using the crick, maybe that's what they did. Maybe they did your exact suggestion first, and they disguised themselves to look like the Kryn and came in.
I don't know.
-LIAM-
I did not say that it is heavily fortified, although I'm sure it is. It is the largest city in the empire. When I lived there-- and it was only briefly when I was at school-- I could go anywhere in the city I wanted because I'm a citizen of the empire.
-SAM-
I assume it's a hard place to attack or infiltrate.
-LIAM-
The largest city in the empire?
-MARISHA-
Rexxentrum.
-LIAM-
That would be hard to attack.
-TRAVIS-
Unless you could dig underground with a bunch of pet worms.
-TALIESIN-
Does make one wonder why they haven't done that yet.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe they're baby steps.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Doesn't feel like too many places on the map are off limits.
-TRAVIS-
Plus it'd be super nice if you could take the most powerful city in the empire and slow it the fuck down before you attacked it.
That might work.
-TALIESIN-
This is all very confusing.
-MARISHA-
Speaking of, when I was talking to the doctor, Demi, she said she had a few instances over the last month or so where people were coming in feeling nauseous, feeling not like themselves in a grouped amount of time.
All from the cluster.
-TALIESIN-
Do we want to poke this thing tonight, or do we not?
-SAM-
Poke the tunnel?
-TALIESIN-
Not the tunnel. I mean--
-TRAVIS-
We'll get to the tunnel. We need to get her son out, and then we can decide.
What thing were you talking about poking?
-TALIESIN-
We have an object. We have another object. Maybe we haven't really-- I mean, I doubt that we really understand what we have, but--
-MARISHA-
You want to head towards Xhorhas, is what you're saying.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, we have these things right now.
-LAURA-
Are you saying you want to look at them?
-TALIESIN-
I kind of do.
-LAURA-
Because Yussa said we shouldn't pull it out. Especially right now, if people are looking for it, it could be really bad.
-TALIESIN-
I suppose.
-MARISHA-
That's the thing. You're talking about poking that thing? The dodecahedron?
-TRAVIS-
Yep. That's what he's talking about.
-MARISHA-
No!
-SAM-
To do what?
-TRAVIS-
Because it's there to do.
Normally, all about that.
-LAURA-
If Fjord is saying that is a bit-- then you know.
-TALIESIN-
I'll follow the group, but--
-TRAVIS-
Dragon sucked.
-TALIESIN-
-- I'm here because where I was, I was out of options. We've definitely found some options. I don't know what they mean yet, but I went looking for them, and here we are.
-TRAVIS-
I agree.
-MARISHA-
Caleb-- sorry, Caduceus. Freudian slip.
-TRAVIS-
Carl. Kevin. Keep going.
-LAURA-
Brent.
-MATT-
Jeff.
-TRAVIS-
It's a "K" sound.
-MARISHA-
You said the life force was being sucked away from your grave, from your home.
-TALIESIN-
That's right. Has been for a while. The forest that surrounds it, the corrupted forest, is overtaking it as if the magic that held it in place is being supplanted. I'm of the opinion that that shouldn't be happening. There are several other-- we're not the only site like our own.
We haven't had much communication with the other sites, so I don't know if it's happening anywhere else.
-LAURA-
Do you want me to send them a message?
-TALIESIN-
I wouldn't even know who to send it to.
We're supposed to protect that place, and I was running out of ideas.
-TRAVIS-
You said we.
-TALIESIN-
My family.
-TRAVIS-
How many of them are there?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, lots. I mean, depending on when and where. Members of my family and others have been protecting that place for as long as it has existed. We built the temple. We founded it.
-LAURA-
Your family's still there now?
-TALIESIN-
No, they all left.
-MARISHA-
You said also to look for answers, though, right? They left first?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, and none of them have come back.
-MARISHA-
You have any idea which direction they were heading?
-TALIESIN-
Not really.
-MARISHA-
You can speak to the Wildmother. You've checked in on a few of our friends. Do you ever check in on them, see what the Wildmother tells you?
-TALIESIN-
I feel like she would let me know if I needed to know. That's not an answer I really want the-- that's not an answer I'm looking for right now. I'm sure you understand.
-MARISHA-
I do.
-TALIESIN-
Best to have faith and not second guess how she's decided to move forward. If I recall, Corin talked about trying to find some of the other temples, but I don't know. No one's come back. When you came around, I had an inkling that it was supposed to be my job to do this from the beginning and that I had been shirking my duties.
You all seemed like a very good sign that it was time to take some responsibility.
-SAM-
What was your name before this? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Those who knew me called me Geoff.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
It's such a good name!
-TALIESIN-
It's a good name. Spelled it with a "G."
-MARISHA-
It's a great name.
-TALIESIN-
I've got nothing to hide.
-MARISHA-
Geoff with a "G" or Jeff with a "J"?
-TALIESIN-
"G". What's wrong with you? Don't even--
-MARISHA-
Yeah, sure.
-SAM-
Can we go to sleep so we can find out if my husband's alive?
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Yeah!
-TALIESIN-
Now I have anxiety. I may not sleep tonight, now. It's a lot of pressure to put on a person.
-TRAVIS-
Herbal tea, some melatonin, something, right?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, this is caffeinated.
I'm going to be up all night. Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Jester, you okay?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
What's wrong?
-LAURA-
It's a little overwhelming. I mean, this is some serious shit. I mean, I came from Nicodranas, and everything was nice. The empire is really fucked up. Everybody went through such horrible things, and I'm really sorry for everyone. That's all.
-SAM-
Thank you. I promise you, if you stay with us, you will also go through some horrible, horrible things.
-LAURA-
Don't worry, Nott. I already have.
-SAM-
Oh, good.
-LAURA-
I'm sure there is worse to come.
We'll get through it, though.
-MARISHA-
I mean, nice is boring after a while.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
We can get to nice. Right? Eh.
-LAURA-
I would like nice again at some point.
-TALIESIN-
I just want home back. I want to know that it's safe again.
-MARISHA-
I'm sure there's some beachfront property open in Nicodranas. Maybe, if we work really hard and pool our funds, we can retire.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
You're always welcome where I live.
-SAM-
I'm like nine, so I don't know about retiring yet.
-LAURA-
Do you want to be a halfling again?
-SAM-
I want to be me again, yes. Yes.
I hope that someday it can happen.
-LAURA-
We should talk to Yussa.
Maybe he can help you.
-SAM-
That's true. He's a very powerful wizard.
That would be nice.
-MARISHA-
You didn't get turned into all the things that you're afraid you are.
It's not how this shit works.
-SAM-
Well, I guess it remains to be seen.
-LAURA-
You're still pretty cool. I mean, the coolest goblin I've ever known.
-SAM-
Yeah, I suppose. That one in Nicodranas was pretty cool, though. He had slicked-back hair--
-LAURA-
Yeah, he was wearing pretty fancy clothes and stuff.
-MARISHA-
Do you want us to still call you Nott?
-LAURA-
Or Veth? Or Vott?
-SAM-
Wow, that's weird. Let's stick with Nott for now. When I'm back again, I'll change it.
-MARISHA-
Nott and Caleb it is.
-TALIESIN-
Until you're ready for something else.
-SAM-
Absolutely.
-MARISHA-
The Mighty Nein. Made of seven people.
Works great.
-SAM-
Nothing makes sense.
-MARISHA-
Nope.
-LIAM-
Not the name. Not the group. None of it.
-TRAVIS-
Well, I'm going to bed.
-LIAM-
(sad trombone)
-SAM-
That was as Caleb, in canon.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
You sang!
-MATT-
Weirdest use of Prestidigitation I've ever seen.
-LIAM-
Little floating trombones.
-MATT-
Mysterious Merrie Melodies like (whoomp).
-LIAM-
(sad trombone)
-MATT-
You guys get an evening's rest in your respective rooms.
The morning greets you with the smell of food being prepared as you head downstairs.
As all of you and two other patrons that are couple of other farmhands--
-TRAVIS-
What do they look like?
-MATT-
They look like farmhands.
-TALIESIN-
What is their real name?
-LAURA-
What are they sitting on?
-MATT-
Their names are Chair.
Together, they are... Chair.
-MATT-
You're a chair.
-TALIESIN-
You've been lying.
You don't even have a leg to stand on.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
Leave the table.
-SAM-
When everyone's serious, Taliesin is the comic relief.
-TALIESIN-
Here to bring the awkward.
-MATT-
Good, I love it. You have your meal.
The day is yours. What do you wish to do?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to find an appropriate spot: somewhere quiet, somewhere with a view, somewhere where the Wildmother's work is well at hand.
-MATT-
Okay. That would be probably either on the Tillage itself or some of the small grove clusters along the river that you guys were talking earlier. I assume you're casting Divination?
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
A reminder, it is a specific question concerning a goal, event, or activity to occur within seven days.
-LIAM-
(whispering) Ask about the chair.
-TALIESIN-
You've entirely thrown me.
-MARISHA-
(whispering) Was the chair made by Geoff?
-MATT-
Whatever you're trying to ascertain, it needs to be involving a specific goal, an event, or activity within the next seven days.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I was going to basically go for the same thing I did last time, if that still suits.
Unless you would like me to shift a little bit, for your own--
-MATT-
I let it go a little bit last time, only because it was a question of what were they doing right now. It's like, well, that's an activity that they were doing, I guess.
Choose your words carefully, is all I'm saying.
-TALIESIN-
A goal? Hmm.
-MATT-
An event, or an activity. I mean, that's a broad spectrum, so be specific.
-TALIESIN-
Yessa. I want to make sure I'm getting the name right, right?
-SAM-
Yeza Brenatto.
-TALIESIN-
Yeza. I sit, make my circle. What is Yeza's destination? Pushing a few days forward.
-MATT-
You close your eyes and concentrate.
It's a beautiful morning, actually.
It's a chilly morning, but this far enough south in the empire, hasn't hit snow yet. The full winter hasn't come into effect, so it's still green fields and mostly blue sky with bits of clouds. As you concentrate, the chilled wind picks up a little bit. Across the wind, it begins to form words through your ears.
(wind blowing) (whispering) "Ghor Dranas."
-TALIESIN-
Ghor Dranas.
-SAM-
What?
-LIAM-
Ghor Dranas. Xhorhas.
-TRAVIS-
(whispering) What?
-MARISHA-
(whispering) Something Dranas. Ghor Dranas.
-TALIESIN-
That's all I have.
-SAM-
We've heard that before. That's in Xhorhas.
-LAURA-
Yeah. It's in here.
-SAM-
Yes, it's in there. The cricks took him.
Does that mean he's alive?
-TALIESIN-
Probably.
-SAM-
Thank you, Caduceus.
-LAURA-
Citadel! They have a citadel.
-TALIESIN-
Seems silly to move someone who isn't.
-MATT-
Anyone here who's proficient in history, make a history check, if you don't mind.
-MARISHA-
I am.
-SAM-
How's Yasha? Because she's been to fucking Xhorhas before.
-LAURA-
That's right.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I know. What's Yasha up to?
-MATT-
Yasha's with you guys.
-SAM-
Does she know anything about this place?
-LIAM-
I also had notes, and I read a book at the Cobalt Soul about Xhorhas. I have all that.
-MATT-
What did you roll?
-LIAM-
Oh, 17.
-MARISHA-
19.
-MATT-
I'm seeing how much detail you get.
19, good! Yasha first pipes in and goes, "Well, I've heard the name. It's far further north than where I lived, and we avoided it because a lot of the beast folk live that way."
-LIAM-
Beast folk. What do you mean?
-MATT-
"Meaning the others who wander the wastes.
There are men who are like bull warriors as well, and bugbears, and other goblinoids. Some are wild and angry and hungry, and we had to protect or raid them first. Others, they work with the Kryn.
That's farther north, but I've not been there."
-LIAM-
Have you ever heard of something called the Luxon?
-MATT-
"I have not."
-SAM-
What is that? What's Deluxin'?
-LIAM-
The Luxon.
-LAURA-
It's a casino.
-SAM-
No, it is not.
-LIAM-
I'm not sure. I read about them, or it. I don't what it is. Something that is having some sort of negative effect on the people of Ghor Dranas.
-MARISHA-
Would I know anything about that?
-MATT-
No, you would not. But with the history checks you guys did pull on Ghor Dranas, Ghor Dranas is important to the history of the Age of Arcanum. When the gods walked the earth, both Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods, there were various areas that were considered their realm of influence on the mortal plane, outside of their home realms in the different inner and outer planes. A number of these citadels of the Betrayer Gods were concentrated around Xhorhas and the surrounding landscape. That's where the most intense battles took place of the Calamity, was on Wildemount. Ghor Dranas was the name of the center of their tenuous union. Essentially, in the final years of the Calamity, it was where all of the Betrayer Gods would go to plot the undoing of the rest of the free people and their creators in Exandria. What remains of Ghor Dranas is where the Kryn have established their empire, their dynasty.
It's essentially the capital city of the Kryn dynasty.
-MARISHA-
What was it that those letters were saying was under Ghor Dranas? Or they were looking for things?
-LAURA-
No, that wasn't it. They were saying that they couldn't believe that Ghor Dranas was holding secrets, like that they had a whole other school of magic that we haven't discovered here.
-LIAM-
This, everything we've been talking about.
It says in there that they control fate and time.
-MATT-
Yasha pipes up and says, "From all that I know, people in my clan saying that that area up north is perpetual night."
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>, I have read this. All around Ghor Dranas.
-MATT-
"From what I hear, yes."
-LAURA-
Wow.
-LIAM-
An empress runs it named Leylas Kryn.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I remember hearing about her.
-TALIESIN-
We may get lucky if we go into the tunnel. They may still be preparing at some point to head in that direction. They're not there yet.
-LAURA-
We could go after them.
-SAM-
We're talking about hundreds of miles.
-TALIESIN-
They haven't made it that far yet, though.
It's where they will be, not where they are.
-MATT-
As a note, just to remind you, if you're thinking of distances and times. The attack transpired weeks ago, so you're not right on their tail. Consider that in what you're planning.
-TRAVIS-
They fucking out.
-MATT-
Mind you, your options are your options.
-TALIESIN-
The north is looking interesting.
-MATT-
There are many possibilities here. Many.
-LIAM-
We are focusing on your fellow.
-SAM-
Well yes, if that's all right with you.
I don't want to drag you all to the center of Xhorhas, where the beasts live, and the capital city where the empress is. It seems like, if we go to Rexxentrum, we're in deep trouble.
If we go to Xhorhas, we're in even worse trouble.
-TALIESIN-
I think trouble's going to close up on us, no matter what.
-LIAM-
There are beasts in the north, but Yeza is not.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, what else are we going to do?
-MARISHA-
I oddly feel more comfortable going to Ghor Dranas than I do going to Rexxentrum.
-TALIESIN-
I feel like it might be a sign.
-SAM-
(huffs) How do we get there? I mean, are we really going to go through tunnels for several weeks until we get--
-TALIESIN-
We've got a cart. I'm not even kidding a bit.
-TRAVIS-
Maybe, maybe not.
-LAURA-
We take our cart, and we head straight toward the worst of the war.
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
-SAM-
Then when we get there, what do we say? Hey everybody, we're here in town to sell our wares!
-TRAVIS-
We don't even know if the tunnels are accessible to us. Why don't we see if they are, first?
-TALIESIN-
I'll also say, it's not the worst of the war right now, is Ghor Dranas? That's past it.
-MATT-
You don't quite know where Ghor Dranas is.
You know it's east. Right now, the war is right here.
These are the garrisons. Put that in the center, there. By the Brokenveil Bluffs, these are where the two, the Ashguard and Rockguard Garrisons are. One of the garrisons has been lost to the Kryn, and they are currently holding it at the border. Bladegarden, right there, is the foremost front of the military now. The conflict right now is being held-- from what you've heard so far. Your information is dicey at best because you've been gone for a while. The last you know, this is where the focus of the conflict is.
There you go.
-LIAM-
Gentlemen, we can't fight in here.
-TALIESIN-
It's the war room.
-SAM-
If we go over land, we'll be going right through the front of the war. If we go under land, we'll be underground for <i>weeks</i>.
-TALIESIN-
Also, in tunnels built for war. That's the thing. There's no fighting the war.
-MARISHA-
I agree with what one of you said.
-TRAVIS-
It was probably me. I'm very wise and agreeable.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm. That once we get there, we're fucking nobodies. What are we going to do?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we can't fight an entire army.
-TALIESIN-
We don't have to. That's the thing.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, we took that wrong turn at Albuquerque, right? We'll get back and skedaddle out of there if we have to.
-LAURA-
Want me to send him a message? What if I'm like: Hey dude. Do you think that you're going to be able to escape or something?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, weren't we more concerned about that when we thought he was in Rexxentrum?
-LAURA-
Oh boy.
-SAM-
If you did send him a message, I would urge you to do something hopeful.
-LAURA-
Like what? What do you want me to say?
-SAM-
Stay alive, and we'll try to find you.
-LAURA-
Describe him to me.
-SAM-
Well, he is short, even for halflings, and he has bushy brown hair, long sideburns.
I always tell him to cut them, but he always keeps them long. He likes them long.
-LIAM-
Nott, can you make yourself look like him?
-LAURA-
Oh, that'll work.
-SAM-
Oh. Sure, yes, I can. I will Disguise Self.
-MATT-
You get a very clear image of the last memory that Nott has of Yeza.
-SAM-
Big nose, not a great chin, bushy dark hair, long sideburns, sort of narrow shoulders.
(whispering) Not a looker--
-LAURA-
I can see what you saw in him.
-SAM-
But he is to me.
-LIAM-
He seems like an interesting fellow.
-SAM-
He was wonderful.
-SAM-
Is.
-MARISHA-
How long have you two been married?
-SAM-
Do you count the time that I was dead and a goblin?
-SAM-
Because I lost my ring.
-TALIESIN-
It's really not about that, though, is it?
-LIAM-
That's a symbol. The person's more important.
-SAM-
Five years, then. Married young.
-MARISHA-
(stuttering) Happy anniversary. Right?
-SAM-
Thank you.
-TRAVIS-
Why did you say that?
-MARISHA-
That's what people say, right?
-TRAVIS-
Usually on the anniversary of when they were married. Not just like, you're married! Happy anniversary!
-MARISHA-
Congratulations?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm. Better. Yep.
-LIAM-
So we have to come up with a plan for what we are doing.
-SAM-
For sure, we do.
-LIAM-
Rexxentrum is its own set of problems and dangers. Your husband is heading towards Xhorhas and a war. I am not feeling very optimistic about the tunnels, but I have been wrong about many things. So why don't we check out the tunnels? Let's do something positive.
-TRAVIS-
Let's get your son out.
-TALIESIN-
I'm also, I will admit, not feeling very positive about the tunnels. But we should take a look because the other option is the cart.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go. Son. Let's get started.
-SAM-
We're going to Luke first, to the son? Sending him on a wagon or something?
-TALIESIN-
I believe you gave them quite a bit of money.
-SAM-
Sure, but we still have to tell them where to go and when to go. We'll go there.
-LIAM-
Should we hire someone to go with them as muscle?
-SAM-
Yes! Absolutely.
-TALIESIN-
There's probably people coming and going on most of these roads who are used to moving people across.
-SAM-
Was there a Jeff fellow? He's a fighter?
-MARISHA-
He's a little worse for wear, but he said he had a few friends that fared out okay that are still around. I could ask him for a recommendation.
-SAM-
Okay. Well, let's go talk to Edith first, I guess. Ask her if she wants to leave.
-LAURA-
While we're going, I'm going to try and send a message to Yeza.
-MATT-
Okay. What message do you send?
-LAURA-
I'm a friend of Veth. We know you've been taken, but stay hopeful; we're looking for you.
If you can, tell us where you are currently.
-MATT-
There's no response, and then a very faint one. "Hello? I don't know. It's very dark.
I have to be quiet, but thank you." That's it.
-LAURA-
Nott, he's alive! He said it's dark and he has to stay quiet, but thank you.
-SAM-
(sighs) Good. That means I didn't lie to my son.
-LAURA-
We'll find him.
-SAM-
I believe it. Yes. All right, let's go to Edith.
-LIAM-
Take care of your family.
-SAM-
Yes, yes!
-MATT-
Do you change your form, or do you show up as Yeza?
-SAM-
I mean, we talked about someone else going over there.
-TALIESIN-
Scarred for life!
-TRAVIS-
Everything's fine! Just going to the beach for a bit.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, don't show up as his dad and ship him away. It doesn't work out well, I promise.
-SAM-
I don't know. How do we convey this message?
-TRAVIS-
It's up to you.
-SAM-
(sighs)
-LAURA-
Want me to go?
-TALIESIN-
You're good with kids, I imagine.
-LAURA-
Kids really like me.
-SAM-
Everyone likes you. You're lovable.
-LAURA-
Thanks, Nott.
-SAM-
Don't you think so, Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
But like, really?
-LAURA-
Stop it.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LIAM-
That's two "stop it"s tonight.
-LAURA-
Yeah, there it is. I should go find Old Edith and I'm going to say what?
-SAM-
You're going to say: I have a message from Veth. She wants you to go far away, where it's safe, to Alfield. Use the money she gave you.
Men will be here tomorrow to escort you.
-LAURA-
There's men coming too?
-SAM-
We're going to hire somebody, I don't know.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-SAM-
Jeff's friend.
-LAURA-
I'll go find Old Edith.
-MATT-
You find your way to the exterior of Edith's house.
-MARISHA-
Geoffman and Geoffrey. Geoff's friends.
-MATT-
A few moments pass, a door opens.
"Hi, can I help you?"
-LAURA-
Hi, Edith?
-MATT-
"Yes."
-LAURA-
Hello.
-MATT-
"Hello."
-LAURA-
You may remember me from the other night.
I was outside? I'm a friend of Veth.
-MATT-
"Right, yes. Can I help you?"
-LAURA-
Yes. She, of course, had to be on her way because things are hard right now, but she wanted to convey her desire for you and Lucas-- Lucas?
-TRAVIS-
Luke.
-LAURA-
-- Luke to find your way to Alfield.
-MATT-
"Why are we heading to Alfield?"
-LAURA-
Because she doesn't think it is safe for you to be here right now. Now, Alfield is very safe and there's a wonderful person there named Bryce, who we've already sent word to because we're pretty powerful, and they'll be expecting you.
She said to use the money that she gave you to head there and get a place to stay and use it for food. Buy yourself something nice, you know?
-MATT-
"Oh, okay. How long are we supposed to be staying?"
-LAURA-
As long as it takes, because it's pretty dangerous still, but we will be able to send word to you and let you know when it's safe to come home, which is good!
-MATT-
"Okay."
-LAURA-
You should get your stuff together, because tomorrow somebody will be here to escort you to the city.
-MATT-
"Oh, that's nice."
-LAURA-
Yeah. Is there anything else I can do for you, Edith?
-TRAVIS-
Best customer service ever.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-MATT-
"Does Alfield-- do they have-- I've never been to Alfield, so I'm just wondering-- never mind." She turns around.
-LAURA-
Okay. Bryce will be looking for you!
-MATT-
"Bryce, got it!" She turns back to you and goes, "Thank you."
-LAURA-
Oh, you're welcome. Have a wonderful day.
-MATT-
"You too!"
-SAM-
(like Jester) Would you like to take a survey and tell me how my service was?
-LAURA-
It will only take five minutes of your time!
-MARISHA-
Is it okay that I recorded our conversation?
-TRAVIS-
(like Jester) You need to hang up because I can't technically hang up on this call.
-MATT-
All righty. You guys go and search for--?
-SAM-
Jeff. Jeff's friends.
-MARISHA-
Go back to Demi's place, Demi Lovato-- not Demi Lovato.
-MATT-
You find Jeff there as soon as you walk into the door. Demi's off to the side, reading a leather-bound journal that she's either reading or making notes in. She looks up and she goes, "Aye?"
-MARISHA-
I look over Demi's shoulder. What is she looking at? What is she reading?
-MATT-
No, she pulls it back.
-MARISHA-
Oh, hey. Didn't mean to interrupt. This feels sensual in some ways. Tusk Love? No? Anyway--
-SAM-
Weird opener.
-TRAVIS-
I want to toss you a pickaxe for that shovel you're using.
-MARISHA-
Hey, Jeff, your friends--
-MATT-
You look over to Jeff, who's like, "Oh, no."
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Don't tap my shoulder again!
-MARISHA-
I promise I won't touch you. Your friends that you said were helping you, that fared out better than you did?
-MATT-
"Yeah, what about them?"
-MARISHA-
Are they a little over their job? You think they might want to take a little walk-about?
-MATT-
"I mean, they can't abandon--"
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) Their post?
-MATT-
"That's-- no! What are you asking?"
-TRAVIS-
Fucking AWOL!
-SAM-
Cool.
-TRAVIS-
They took an oath and shit.
-MARISHA-
Do you know of any freelance people? Mercenaries, friends who are semi-trustworthy?
-MATT-
"What for?"
-MARISHA-
I need an escort to take a couple of people down to Alfield.
-MATT-
"To Alfield? That's easy."
-MARISHA-
Okay, can you--
-MATT-
"My friends can probably do that. It's just to Alfield and back; they can say it's under business."
-MARISHA-
Yeah? Does that mean the taxpayers pay for it and we don't have to? Is there a matter of state security?
-MATT-
"No, you still have to pay them. This is under the table, technically."
-MARISHA-
Oh. That's what I would say.
All right, cool. Where do I find them?
-MATT-
"Hold on." (groaning) He sits up and stands up slowly.
-MARISHA-
I try and-- let me--
-MATT-
The two of you limp down to one of the tiny little seedy bars that doesn't even have a name on the front.
-MARISHA-
You don't have to guide me, you could just tell me--
-MATT-
"I'm going to put it out there: you don't have a trustworthy face.
They're not going to talk to you.
I need to introduce you."
-MARISHA-
All right. Here, you want a piggyback ride?
-MATT-
"Don't you touch me."
-MARISHA-
All right. You want a walking stick? I got my staff.
-MATT-
"I'll take that." You guys make your way in.
-LAURA-
It's got a bow on it.
-MARISHA-
It's got a bow, yeah.
It still has a bow.
-MATT-
There's a handful of folks here. You see three very, very old farmer-types that this is their retirement, is coming here everyday and complaining and drinking themselves to an early-- earlier-- grave. You do see two crownsguard that are working their way slowly through an ale and chatting to each other. As he walks in, "Hey!" and "Oh, what's up, hey buddy! You're walking around, that's great!" He's like, (straining) "Yeah, I've got a job for you. What's your name again?"
-MARISHA-
Beau.
-MATT-
"Beau, this is Jordan and Jay. They're going to go ahead and help you out with this.
How much are you paying?"
-MARISHA-
Nott! How much are we paying?
-SAM-
Whatever it fucking takes!
-TRAVIS-
All your money.
-SAM-
Yes, absolutely!
-MATT-
"It's to Alfield and back. It's an escort."
-MARISHA-
What's the average running cost for an escort?
-MATT-
You see the gentleman who was introduced as Jordan goes, "Well, to and from Alfield, that's a number of days' travel including night camping costs, board, staying there in Alfield. I'd say, for the each of us round-trip, puts you at about 35 gold pieces."
-SAM-
Give him 80.
-LAURA-
(sounds of distress)
-TALIESIN-
Total.
-MARISHA-
I'll give you 80, 40 apiece. You can split it between the two of you.
Extra five gold, make sure you actually give a fuck about this job.
-MATT-
"You're a hard negotiator. I respect that.
It's a deal."
-MARISHA-
Am I? Yeah. Fuck yeah, man.
Seriously, don't fuck this up.
-MATT-
"Okay."
-MARISHA-
I will fucking kill you if you fuck it up.
-MATT-
"Where did you meet this woman?" He's like, "Look, she's been this way, but she pays well, apparently, and I want to help you guys out. I'm going to go lay back down," and he starts making his way back with your stick.
-MARISHA-
Okay, you got to be at Old Edith's place tonight with a cart. Maybe bring some sleeping bags, some extra food. There's a kid.
-MATT-
"I missed the deal, who are we escorting?"
-MARISHA-
Old Edith--
-MATT-
"Edith?"
-MARISHA-
Yeah, and Luke, the kid.
-SAM-
To Bryce.
-MARISHA-
To Bryce, in Alfield.
-MATT-
"All right, I got it. No worries, we got it taken care of. We got you taken care of! We're good! We're just going to finish our drinks and we'll start getting our stuff together."
-TRAVIS-
(pigeon cooing)
-MARISHA-
What'd you say?!
-TRAVIS-
(cooing) I'm just a pigeon, what do you want?
-MARISHA-
You're just cooing!
-LAURA-
You're not even saying anything; you're just a pigeon!
-MARISHA-
It's just atmosphere.
-MATT-
Geoff has made his way partially back to Demi's place with your staff.
-LAURA-
Go get your staff back!
-MARISHA-
Give me my fucking staff!
-MATT-
"Oh, jeez! Okay."
-MARISHA-
I do flick him in one of his burns, though, again, just because.
-MATT-
(groaning) "What is wrong with you?!"
-MARISHA-
You're a good guy, Jeff.
-MATT-
"Huh?"
-MARISHA-
It's how I show affection.
-MATT-
"I don't like you."
-MARISHA-
Then I walk off.
-MATT-
Okay. He makes his way back. You've hired some crownsguards under the table to keep an eye and escort Edith and Luke over to Alfield to meet with Bryce, where they're going to take care of them to some degree.
-SAM-
Okay, so what do <i>we</i> do?
-MATT-
Yes, what do you do?
-SAM-
Do we go in the tunnels? Do you want to go in the tunnels? Okay.
-LIAM-
Well, I imagine the same guards will be out there again. Are we just going to plunge on in and try to--
-TRAVIS-
Do we see any of the elven folk of the two that we have been talking about while we're walking around?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TALIESIN-
Do you want advantage on that, or do you want me to join you?
-TRAVIS-
You do it as well.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Trying to be good about this.
That's 17.
-MATT-
Fjord?
-TRAVIS-
That's a one.
-MARISHA-
(stammering) You do it as well.
-MATT-
Your head turns to the left and you're like, "Where are those-- that cloud looks like an eagle." You, Caduceus, do a pretty fair look around.
You do not recognize anyone that resembles the figures in question.
-TALIESIN-
No elves, all right.
-MATT-
There are elves around, but maybe two or three since you've come here.
-TALIESIN-
Not with intense gravitas.
-MATT-
There aren't many elves in Felderwin. Most of the Empire elves are further northward, in the Zemni Fields.
You've seen a few, and a handful of half elves, but none of the type that you are looking for.
These are not the elves you're looking for.
-MARISHA-
Can I also, just for blanket statement, I take my gold and I parcel it out and put it in different pockets, ever since Hupperdook.
-MATT-
Okay. Would you like to buy more pockets? Or pouches?
-SAM-
Buy more pockets.
-MATT-
I mean, unless you're walking around like Rob Liefeld character--
-MARISHA-
I was just going to say, is this a Liefeld comic?
-TALIESIN-
I assume that we live in a Liefeld universe where as you're born, you accumulate pockets slowly all over you.
-MATT-
Yeah, and you grow more and more teeth.
-TALIESIN-
All the way down the ankle, yeah.
-MATT-
Your feet vanish.
-MARISHA-
Sure. I will Liefeld float to the nearest general store and pick up a few extra pockets.
-SAM-
Hi, I'm here to buy some pockets?
-TALIESIN-
I'm so sorry, I'm all out.
-LIAM-
We just won Dungeons &amp; Dragons, guys.
-MATT-
Easy enough. You head over to the Felderwin General, helmed by Dupont Briggsman, this young dwarven salesman. Tanned skin, light brown hair, a bit of a chin beard. He says, "Are you looking for pockets, you said?"
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm. What kind of pockets you got?
-MATT-
"Well, belt pouches, I've got money belts, if that's what you're looking for."
-MARISHA-
Do you have one of those where it goes around your neck, but tucks in on the inside of your shirt?
-MATT-
"I've got something that you could probably affix that would be similar, maybe."
-MARISHA-
I'll get one of those and I get one of the money belts. Does anybody else want a money belt? (shouting) Stocking up on money belts!
-TRAVIS-
What?
-MARISHA-
Money belts!
-SAM-
You brought us here for money belts. My husband is being kidnapped by crick terrorists.
-MARISHA-
Honestly, I thought that it was just going to be a little quick thing and he was going to be like, "For brevity's sake," like he does, but he didn't.
-SAM-
Sure. Nope, this is a full scene.
-MARISHA-
I just want pockets.
-MATT-
"So just the two?"
-MARISHA-
Sure.
-MATT-
"Let's say, eight silver?"
-MARISHA-
Done.
-MATT-
"All right, there you go." Passes it over.
-MARISHA-
Okay, let's go.
-TALIESIN-
Let's head to the tunnel and if that doesn't pan out, we'll start heading north.
-LAURA-
I rearrange some things on the shelves as she's doing that.
-MATT-
Make a sleight of hand check for me.
-SAM-
Oh, fuck you.
-LAURA-
16.
-TRAVIS-
Arrested.
-MATT-
He is happily picking out and handing over belt pouches as you completely disorganize his probably very carefully and intentionally placed system. Well done.
-LAURA-
Thanks.
-SAM-
Okay, off to the tunnels.
-MATT-
You sense a faint smile over your shoulder.
-MATT-
All right, making your way-- oh?
-SAM-
Any guards around there?
-MATT-
Oh yes. You see each tunnel has somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six guards stationed to each. Some of them are just sitting down, bored with their posting. They've been told to keep watch, but not a whole lot's happening until you guys approach. You're heading towards the center tunnel, which is the one that already has the fairly deep dig, and as you approach, the guards all stand up. Some of them are holding spears and are using them to get to their feet. They look over in your direction. These are not the same guards you spoke to last night.
-SAM-
Fjord? Caduceus, any ideas on how to get our cart down into the tunnel?
-TRAVIS-
Wheel it?
-SAM-
To get past the guards?
-TALIESIN-
We honestly first have to even see if it's possible to get in there.
-LIAM-
We'll be lucky if we can proceed. I don't think we can take the cart with us.
-MATT-
The width of the tunnel as it is, the cart's going to be a very tight fit, let alone getting two horses to pull it for you underground.
-TALIESIN-
I have a funny feeling that this is less of a "we can walk all the way to Albuquerque" as more as a there's possibly something down there or they're still in there that's just a little bit of a--
-SAM-
It's been weeks. They're not down there.
This is folly.
-TALIESIN-
I don't think they've been moving the whole time.
-LIAM-
It's worth just checking the box. Perhaps it connects to a larger cave system that they used-- we don't know-- but the cart cannot come.
-SAM-
The easiest way to check is for, sorry, Jester, to go look.
-LAURA-
Yeah. I'll go look. If we can get down there. Hey, so, we were here yesterday.
-MATT-
They all look at each other and one of them who looks probably to have a little more authority who has probably been assigned to be the head of the rest of the crownsguard, steps forward and goes, "Yeah, what of it?"
-TRAVIS-
We're part of a research expedition. We were here and we were hoping we could toss you a little bit of coin and, you know, check out this area here a bit.
-TALIESIN-
We pinged something in the center cave and we just needed to reconvene before we came back to take a look at it.
-MATT-
"And by whose guidance are you assigned to do this?"
-MARISHA-
Cobalt Soul. Beauregard. Been taking notes. From Zadash.
-MATT-
"They've signed authority?"
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it's called this belt and these vestiges on my fucking body.
-LAURA-
Shit.
-MATT-
"You make a deception check, you make an intimidation check."
-SAM-
You just pointed to two orange pockets.
-MATT-
Made in Felderwin.
-TRAVIS-
24.
-MARISHA-
15. You said intimidation, right?
-MATT-
Yes. The guy looks at both of you and his chest-puffed moment of bravado begins to slowly deflate and goes, "Right, okay. What are you looking to do? You just inspecting?"
-TRAVIS-
It's very boring, actually. Yeah. Quite tedious. You use little picks and little brushes, and we covered little--
-MATT-
"Yeah, yeah. I don't really--"
-TRAVIS-
You take a while, and then you brush it and spit on it, you know? Did you want to join?
-MATT-
"No."
-TRAVIS-
It's really quite relaxing. Actually, my friend over here can attest to it.
-TALIESIN-
Actually, he'll keep talking like this if we don't get him to work.
I don't know how that-- I don't really--
-MATT-
"Oh, just do your thing."
-TALIESIN-
I'm on you. Fjord and I--
-MATT-
He steps aside. The other guards, they're eyeing you close; they still have a job to do.
They don't trust you implicitly, but at least they're stepping out of your path to let you go about what business you're attending to.
-LAURA-
So we can get down to the barrier where it stops being clear?
-MATT-
You can climb down because it starts off pretty decent. Where's the cart being left? Or are you bringing it down with you?
-LAURA-
It's staying at the inn for the time being.
-MATT-
Okay. The cart has been set at the inn then.
Are you pre-purchasing board for it?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I will cover the cost of that.
-MATT-
I mean, it can stay there as long as you're renting rooms there, but if you just want it to be kept there, it's a little bit cheaper, but you still have to pay in advance for how long you intend to leave it there for storage.
-TALIESIN-
We don't really know what this is going to look like yet.
-TRAVIS-
Nope.
-SAM-
Two weeks.
-TRAVIS-
Three. Deal.
-SAM-
So 16 days.
-LIAM-
Excuse me, how much would it cost to house our cart here for a month?
-MATT-
Right. You come back and, talking to Simone Deepwell, he's like, "All right, so, three weeks, you're saying?"
-LIAM-
A month.
-MATT-
"A month. Okay. Just the cart and the horse? All right, I'll go ahead and talk to Babs about holding the horse, we can go to--"
-SAM-
The answer is yes. Whatever it costs.
-MATT-
"Oh, okay. Well, for board on that, it's going to run about three silver a night.
We'll say for 30 nights it'll be--"
-SAM-
Done.
-TRAVIS-
We kill him.
-MATT-
That's 90 silver, so nine gold pieces for the month.
-LIAM-
Not a problem. Here you are. One. Two.
-LAURA-
No!
-SAM-
Take care of it.
-MARISHA-
It's like being at the DMV.
-MATT-
(fast forward noise) Back up to the point.
You guys make yourselves down into the tunnel.
Three guards do follow behind at a distance, just keeping an eye on what you're doing.
-SAM-
Who's going in?
-SAM-
No, but who's going past?
-LAURA-
Me.
-TALIESIN-
Are you going to be all right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
She's super strong.
-LAURA-
Sure, and I will stay super strong as I get down there and Polymorph myself.
-MATT-
Oh shit. Into?
-LAURA-
A mole? A gopher? Maybe a gopher.
-TALIESIN-
What's big? A tiny gopher?
-LAURA-
You know what burrows that's bigger, is a honey badger.
-SAM-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
A honey badger. They burrow and are stronger, too.
-MATT-
Okay, hold on here.
-TALIESIN-
Wait a minute? Can you make people bigger?
-LIAM-
For a brief period of time, yeah. Brief.
-TALIESIN-
Can you make a honey badger bigger?
-LIAM-
Yeah, for a minute.
-TRAVIS-
The size of a dog?
-MATT-
A beast of any challenge rating that is equal to or less than the target.
So it can be a CR seven or lower.
-MARISHA-
Liam Las Vegas is having a weird day.
-MATT-
Actually, technically, because-- as you guys rested for the evening and you've completed your journey here and you've begun this next venture-- technically for the night, you guys would hit level eight.
-ALL-
What?!
-MATT-
This is a heads up.
-LIAM-
Oh jeez.
-MATT-
We'll deal with that shortly, but for the time being, a CR eight or smaller beast, you could be.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay, okay. Where would I find that on D&amp;D Beyond?
-LIAM-
Creatures.
-MATT-
You go to Monsters and you would choose Beast.
-LIAM-
All the way to the right, Creatures.
-MATT-
Then for the CR range, you would put from-- I'd say, for safety, one to eight.
-LAURA-
Where are you finding it?
-SAM-
You're right, there's not really anywhere to look.
-TALIESIN-
Wait.
-LAURA-
I don't see Creatures.
-LIAM-
Creatures is over here, so Actions, blah blah blah, all of them are right--
-SAM-
Yeah, and then what?
-LIAM-
Tap it and then search. Just start typing in a name.
-TRAVIS-
Honey badger does not come up.
-MATT-
Welcome to the world of the druid.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-LIAM-
Then use... Google.
-LAURA-
Oh my gosh, wait? This is too complicated.
I got lost in the-- it got lost in the nervous!
-SAM-
This won't be a problem when I'm the president.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
For a badger, a honey badger?
-MARISHA-
You can just-- I think if you go to the top and search "CR 8."
-LAURA-
Look up level eight.
-MATT-
Look up from levels one to eight.
-SAM-
Elephant, ape, giant constrictor snake, giant elk.
-LAURA-
I need something that burrows.
-TRAVIS-
Be an elk.
-TALIESIN-
Don't be an elk.
-TRAVIS-
Be an elk and kill all of these fucking soldiers. (roars)
-MARISHA-
So majestic. So proud.
-MATT-
You know what? Laura, make an intelligence check.
-LAURA-
Oh god. Aww.
-LIAM-
As high as challenge rating what?
-LAURA-
Oh! I rolled pretty-- I think I-- Hold on, I've got to get back to my character.
-TALIESIN-
You rolled really well, though.
-LAURA-
I did, I rolled pretty good.
-TALIESIN-
Hit the view-- yeah, there you go.
-LAURA-
Hit the view button, Laura.
-TALIESIN-
I get lost in here, so, I feel it.
-LAURA-
Okay. Plus-- so 16! I rolled well, but my intelligence is pretty lame.
-MATT-
Okay. There are beasts in the wild. There are wolves, there are cats, there are bears.
You've run across a number of larger versions of these, more dangerous and ominous ones, like when you were in the Savalierwood briefly, you came across a few dire wolves. Use your creative mind on what other possible dire creatures might exist.
-LAURA-
Oh, like a dire badger?
-MATT-
You can try it.
-LAURA-
Okay, I want to be a dire honey badger!
-MATT-
Whether or not one exists, the creative imagination of Jester creates a Polymorph form as you watch her body expand and extend into a massive honey badger, maybe six feet from nose to tail tip, with a series of bony protrusions that run down its back like two spines.
Large teeth and claws that definitely arc and curve outward to about five, six inches beyond the center of the paw, unretracted.
-TRAVIS-
Unretracted.
-LAURA-
(snorting)
-MATT-
You watch as the guards take a step back, like, "Uh..."
-TRAVIS-
It's all normal down here, how are you?
-LAURA-
I turn back and I go (giggle).
-MATT-
How long does that last? It lasts for an hour?
-LAURA-
Yeah. Can I talk in Polymorph? No, I'm straight up that thing.
-MATT-
No, you are a dire honey badger.
-LAURA-
(honey badger sounds)
-SAM-
Dig!
-LAURA-
I'm digging! That's what I'm doing! That's just-- that's what this-- (snarling)
-MATT-
All right, I will say-- go ahead and make an athletics check for me, adding what would be the honey badger's strength, a dire honey badger-- I'll say plus three. So, roll a d20, add plus three.
-LAURA-
Aww! It was so good and then it went to shit!
-SAM-
Aww, it was so close. Yeah, it did.
-LAURA-
Eight.
-MATT-
It's going to take you-- it's a good period of time here of you carving through and taking a break.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to cast Bless on the honey badger just to see if that will help.
I'm going to Bless the honey badger.
-LAURA-
Do I add plus a d4?
-MATT-
You would've had to cast it in advance, but I'll say, in watching this happen-- Bless only lasts a minute, but for that time period, you get a little further and we'll say you start getting more and more exhausted, and then you reach a certain point where the spell expires and your form reverts to a very sweaty, exhausted Jester.
You've carved quite a way. You've pushed probably an additional, in the past hour-- Oh, man.
Another hundred or so feet into the tunnel.
-SAM-
Cast it again.
-LAURA-
(panting) I can't. It is a really high level. Oh, wait.
Do I get another level four at level eight? I don't know.
-MATT-
I'm going to go check right now for you.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to start tapping on the walls of that tunnel-- Well, no.
That tunnel's really thin. If we can--
-MATT-
At level eight, you get a second 4th-level slot.
-LAURA-
I have another 4th-level spell, you guys.
I can do it again!
-SAM-
Do it again!
-LAURA-
Okay. (deep breath)
-MATT-
(boosh) Back into your dire honey badger form.
-TALIESIN-
And Bless!
-MATT-
Go ahead and make another athletics check.
Add plus three, plus a d4.
-LAURA-
Don't fuck me!
-LIAM-
Get us to the Underdark, Laura! Take us to the Underdark.
-MARISHA-
Gil!
-LAURA-
Gil fucked me.
-TALIESIN-
Add your plus four; your d4.
-LAURA-
Okay. Well, at least that's ten.
-MATT-
Ten. Okay.
-MARISHA-
He fucked you.
-LAURA-
He fucked me.
-MATT-
Anyway.
-TRAVIS-
Gil!
-MATT-
You push on for the next 40 or 50 or so minutes, getting an additional 70, 80 feet before eventually one of your paws goes through.
You carve through, and you reach the other side of this collapsed tunnel.
-TRAVIS-
And we all instantly die.
-LAURA-
Yeah, right?
-MATT-
As the molten l-- No, I'm kidding.
-TRAVIS-
No!
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Minecraft!
-MATT-
We've all made this mistake, Taliesin.
-TALIESIN-
No!
-LIAM-
Pick, pick, pick, argh!
-MATT-
Granite, granite!
-LAURA-
As soon as I make a hole I'll turn back into myself and peek through.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LAURA-
Do we still have Bless? No, that only lasts for a minute. 14.
-MATT-
14. As you look past, there's no light source in there, and the hole is only large enough for you to kind of fit your torso through as you glance in. But in the distance you can see-- What is the distance on your darkvision, 60 feet?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Pretty sure it's 60 feet. It's a pretty standard 60 feet for--
-LAURA-
Darkvision, 60 feet; yes.
-MATT-
Got you. The tunnel widens and drops off, like a cliff. You hear a very, very faint sound.
It sounds like running water.
-LAURA-
Is everybody with me?
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
They're behind you, yeah.
-LAURA-
You guys! I think there's a river down here!
-SAM-
They didn't just burrow from Xhorhas, they floated.
-LAURA-
Yeah! That's how they do it so quickly or whatever.
-MARISHA-
I wonder where this underwater system goes.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, they all float down here.
-SAM-
Nope.
-MATT-
Don't want to run into that CR creature.
-MARISHA-
It's like a stream? Oh, we're not there yet.
-MATT-
You're not there.
-MARISHA-
We haven't seen anything yet.
Okay, never mind.
-SAM-
Can you send some light down there?
-TALIESIN-
I'm not-- I don't know where we are.
-MATT-
You guys are all back in the tunnel. It's been dug through, and all of a sudden Jester creates a small hole and then plugs it with herself. You just see the back of Jester, halfway stuck; almost like Winnie the Pooh trying to exit the domicile.
-TALIESIN-
You'd have to flip around and come back, I suppose.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I pull my head back out.
-TRAVIS-
Or you could go check it out by yourself and see what it is.
-LAURA-
What am I? Who do you think I am?
-TRAVIS-
Jester.
-SAM-
Caleb, go look.
-TALIESIN-
Do not send the cleric into the pit of the unknown!
-LIAM-
Oh, this new item.
-SAM-
The ball?
-LIAM-
It follows me.
-MARISHA-
Keep it away from Fjord.
-SAM-
You'll break it. Just send some Dancing Lights.
-LAURA-
Send some Dancing Lights in there.
-LIAM-
I know, I was just curious about my new-- Okay.
-MATT-
Okay, globes appear. By the way, I'm trying to remember. Did you guys take the gray vial with you or did you leave it behind?
-LAURA-
No, we took it.
-LIAM-
Yeah, and the tripod.
-MATT-
Got you. Cool.
-TALIESIN-
We have all the dumb shit we shouldn't have.
-MATT-
Before we moved on, I just want to make sure.
-TRAVIS-
We didn't Identify it, though, did we?
-LIAM-
No.
-MATT-
The globes appear. Are you on the other side of the chamber?
-SAM-
He went in.
-MATT-
Did you go through the hole?
-LIAM-
The hole that was dug by our honey badger?
-MATT-
Correct.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right. You step through and (bloom, bloom, bloom) the orbs appear, and it illuminates the chamber. And it is a chamber. What you've stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern.
About 30 or 40 feet ahead of you it drops off, and looks to be about a ten-foot drop before it hits another straightaway. As it curves to the left, you've already smelled the minerals and the hard water smell of the interior of this chamber.
You glance over to the side and let the orbs drift over a little further, and you can see a river.
It's an underground river, and it seems to have carved its way through this lower portion of the chamber. It vanishes further below into--
-LIAM-
As a point, can I tell if we're walking into any bullshit?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
<i>Ja</i>, okay. Real bad: nine.
-MATT-
Coast looks clear.
-MATT-
But you also notice, as the orbs move through, there are crystal-like, I want to say like quartz crystals, that jut from certain portions of the ceiling, and elements of various-- I always mess up on this: stalactites.
-SAM-
Yes!
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
I've taught myself a million times since I was a kid, and it always transposes--
-TALIESIN-
At the last second.
-MATT-
I know! I'm always like-- Ugh, never right.
Stalactites that come down quite a bit from about a 15-foot-high ceiling from where you're standing, that almost reach the floor where you are.
But over this point where it hangs-- Or where it ends and goes further below.
Do you send the orbs out further?
-LIAM-
No, I'm going to pull them back to me and lose three of them, and pull out that rag that I carry around, and cover them so that it's even dimmer. My transmutation stone is set so that I can see in dim light.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to be the last one. Who's the last one going through the tunnel before we head over?
-MATT-
Are you all going through?
-TRAVIS-
Going through.
-LIAM-
Who wants to walk with me?
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
As you're doing this, the one guard is, "Oh hey, uh--"
-TALIESIN-
Yeah. We've just gotten access to a small pocket that we're just going to check out, make sure everything's safe and appropriate. We'll have a full report once we've finished taking a look inside and we'll be delivering it. But in the meantime, let's not cause any undue panic.
We'll let you know, or we'll make some noise if anything dangerous is down there. It still could not be safe. You're welcome to come, but I'm not sure if it's going to be-- I can't guarantee any safety beyond this point.
-MATT-
Make a deception check.
-SAM-
Is that deception? All right.
-MATT-
It's riding a line. I'll allow persuasion.
Only because you're being vague enough with it that you're riding the line.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, thank you. Okay, that's a 20.
-MATT-
He goes, "Okay, I guess just give us a holler if something goes down."
-TALIESIN-
Thank you, sir. I appreciate everything that you do and--
-MATT-
"Give a loud holler. We're going to probably scoot back, this is a bit creepy."
-TALIESIN-
If things go real wrong, you'll definitely hear us.
-TRAVIS-
(yells)
-MATT-
(surprised exclamation)
-TRAVIS-
Sorry, I tripped. My fault.
-TALIESIN-
I'll make sure that he's quiet, because we don't mind losing him.
-MATT-
"Well, good luck."
-TALIESIN-
I appreciate that.
-MATT-
"Okay." He turns around, the guards start leaving. You hear this very faint, echoing voice going, "They're fucking crazy!"
-TALIESIN-
Crazy like a badger! (badger noises) I'm into it.
-MATT-
So you guys make your way through the tunnel and join Caleb.
-TALIESIN-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
As you all step into the interior, you can also take in that smell of long-sealed underground water, hearing the rushing of the small river. You can see where the path continues on, and with the dim glow and the darkvision, where it curves forward you can see a faint natural arch that looks to be a continuation of the tunnel.
-TALIESIN-
Out of curiosity, those crystals feel utterly natural, right? It just feels like those were not--
-MATT-
Make a nature check.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
Do we have anything to float on? A boat or anything?
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
-TRAVIS-
A boat?
-MATT-
Seven? Probably?
-MARISHA-
We left it in Nicodranas.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
I have this boat dagger, I throw it at the wall and (fwoosh).
-TALIESIN-
I'm thinking about Detect-- Nah.
-LAURA-
I could draw one!
-SAM-
Fuck yes.
-TALIESIN-
Just before we move on, is anyone bothered by these crystals? Is this--
-SAM-
Are they creepy?
-LIAM-
Do you hear anything? Do you see any kind of traps left behind?
-TALIESIN-
I'm a little out of my element, which is surprising to say.
-SAM-
Traps? On the ceiling? Sure, I'll look for traps.
-LIAM-
The people could put them on the ground or anywhere.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TALIESIN-
It's difficult, because we don't really understand how they work.
-SAM-
Investigation?
-MATT-
This is perception because you're looking at things in the distance as opposed to carefully checking what's on the floor.
-SAM-
Perception. 17.
-MATT-
17? Does not appear to be trapped.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
Looks okay.
-TALIESIN-
Let's all prepare to be a little confused by whatever we find.
We're going to be way out of our element.
-LAURA-
Should I cast Pass Without Trace on us and stuff?
-SAM-
There's nothing to hide from.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, there's nobody down here but us.
-SAM-
You need your spells for other things.
-TALIESIN-
If we start to hear something.
-MARISHA-
Feels like there's always things to hide from. I don't know.
-TRAVIS-
Except now.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LAURA-
I cast Pass Without Trace on all of us.
-SAM-
Guys, there's no one I would rather go rescue my husband with.
-MARISHA-
Did you all get a honeymoon?
-SAM-
No, we never did.
-MARISHA-
On the way back: great road trip.
-SAM-
You're right.
-MARISHA-
With seven of your other best friends.
-SAM-
You're right, we never-- We always talked about going to... Tal'Dorei-- (laughter)
For our honeymoon. Never happened. We were saving! I heard Whitestone's really nice.
-TALIESIN-
Tourist trap.
-MARISHA-
Especially in the spring.
(laughing) Tourist trap!
-LIAM-
From everything I read, Ghor Dranas is mysterious and exotic, so let's press on.
I'm going to start walking forward.
-TALIESIN-
Let's go.
-MATT-
As you guys begin to step forward into the darkened, subterranean shadows of this newly discovered tunnel system, and wherever it will lead you eastward, we're going to go ahead and end tonight's episode there.
-LAURA-
God!
-LIAM-
Da da <i>da</i>!
-SAM-
Dun dun <i>dun</i>!
-LAURA-
We are going to have to take a break or like a long rest, because I want my 4th-level spells back, you guys.
-SAM-
What are you talking about? You just used two to be a badger twice.
-TALIESIN-
We're going to take a long rest at some point. I mean, we're moving, but we're going to obviously have to sleep.
-SAM-
We're going to Xhorhas? To do <i>what</i>?
-TRAVIS-
No, we're looking around the corner.
Slow your roll.
-SAM-
Aww, around the corner-- It's 1000 miles away!
-TRAVIS-
You don't know that.
-TALIESIN-
We might find a portal down here, you don't know what's here.
-LIAM-
They might have a little mini-base.
-TALIESIN-
A tiny subterranean boat filled with gummy bears.
-SAM-
Ooh, should we roll for level eight?
-MATT-
Yes, you should.
-SAM-
What do we do?
-MARISHA-
HP, HP, HP!
-SAM-
How do we do this?
-LIAM-
I don't like it, it makes me nervous.
-MARISHA-
A d8, I think.
-LAURA-
(singing) Level up!
-SAM-
When I'm president, they'll just level up for you.
-MATT-
That's what I want out of my Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience.
-SAM-
How do you do this? Oh god.
-LAURA-
You just go-- It's over-- Go back to your character page.
-SAM-
I'm lost already.
-MATT-
You take a d8 die-- Sam, you've played this game for--
-LIAM-
Argh, damn it! Self-fulfilling prophecy.
-LIAM-
I rolled a one.
-MATT-
You reroll ones.
-LIAM-
(triumphant gibberish) Six!
-MATT-
There you go, that's better.
-LIAM-
Yeah! Plus two.
-SAM-
Manage levels.
-LAURA-
Then you go up to level eight.
-MARISHA-
Plus your constitution modifier.
-LAURA-
Then you go to manage HP.
-TRAVIS-
Six, plus...
-SAM-
There we go, manage HP.
-TRAVIS-
What is it, a d8 plus anything?
-MARISHA-
Six!
-TALIESIN-
Three.
-LIAM-
I have 47 hit points, I am invincible!
-LAURA-
Seven!
-SAM-
I roll a d8, apparently. Six.
-MATT-
Man, Six six six. Oh, oh!
-TRAVIS-
Hail Satan!
-SAM-
Where do I put that? Modifier?
-LAURA-
No, you add six to your roll. HP, yeah.
-MATT-
It's six plus your constitution modifier, but when you level up, it should add that automatically in D&amp;D Beyond.
-TALIESIN-
Constitution modifier auto-adds.
-MATT-
Yeah. So you just add the number you rolled.
-SAM-
Ooh, ability score improvement!
-MATT-
Yeah, you guys get to choose to either add plus two to one of your ability scores, or plus one to two different scores, or choose a feat.
-LAURA-
Holy moly!
-SAM-
Oh, shit!
-MATT-
This'll give you a week to consider, you don't have to consider it right now.
-TALIESIN-
I'm already going for it.
-SAM-
What are you going for?
-TALIESIN-
I'm doubling the range of my spellcasting.
-SAM-
You can do that?
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-SAM-
<i>All</i> spells?
-LIAM-
Spell Sniper, man.
-MATT-
Spell Sniper.
-LAURA-
That's pretty sick.
-TALIESIN-
I want to be able to heal from a great distance.
-LIAM-
He's healing at distance.
He's healing for speed--
-LAURA-
Ooh, I can infuse my weapons with poison!
-MATT-
Yeah, your melee attacks do additional poison damage.
-SAM-
Oh my god, so much I can do!
-TRAVIS-
(singing) There's so much I can do.
-TALIESIN-
"When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled. Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarter cover. You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll, choose the cantrip from the Cleric or Druid spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip is wisdom."
-MATT-
It does not help your healing distance, unfortunately.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, really?
-MATT-
It's attack spells.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, that may change my decision, then.
-MATT-
Spells that have an attack roll, that's the key. Like, Guiding Bolt: you double your range, but it doesn't affect your healing.
-TALIESIN-
Or like Bane or Bless, it doesn't help.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, that changes things.
I may play with that.
-SAM-
Oh, by the way: we've all agreed; no one this whole campaign is taking Lucky, right?
-TALIESIN-
I've literally taken it twice already. I mean, I had options, but I don't remember what they are off the top of my head.
-TRAVIS-
No one gets Luck?
-SAM-
It's the worst fucking feat.
-LAURA-
But it's the best feat!
-SAM-
It breaks the game!
-TALIESIN-
It's the thief of one-shots.
-SAM-
No. No one's doing Lucky. I'm decreeing it as your president.
-MATT-
It doesn't break the game, it's just slightly OP.
-TRAVIS-
You are not even the president-elect yet.
I need to see more speeches before I know where <i>my</i> vote's going.
-SAM-
We'll see who runs against me.
-MARISHA-
Free vending machine in the lobby, then I vote for you.
-LAURA-
Are you running against him and you're going to give that?
-TALIESIN-
Or the vending machine is running against him.
-MARISHA-
No, I'm not. No, I'm not doing that. I'm just saying, and I-- Nope.
-MATT-
We'll see what people say. Anyway, you guys have a week to decide. Put some thought to it.
And, for the rest of us, thank you for tuning in for this emotional rollercoaster of a fucking episode.
We'll see you soon enough. Until then, have a wonderful week, we love you, and is it Thursday yet?
-LIAM-
Cheers.
-MATT-
Good night, guys.

Critical Role Campaign 1 Episode 92 "Deals in the Dark"
-MATT-
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! I got Liam back via Skype, somehow after many episodes of him fucking with me. I'm happy.
-TRAVIS-
Payback's a bitch, huh, buddy?
-MATT-
Anyway! Welcome! Laura will be here shortly; she's in traffic coming from her session, so she'll be joining us as soon as she gets here.
Probably next 30 minutes or so. In the meantime, let's go ahead and hop into our announcements for the evening.
-SAM-
Yay!
-MATT-
Returning tonight, we have our fantastic sponsor, Loot Crate!
-ALL-
Loot Crate!
-MATT-
Loot Crate, thank you so much for being an awesome sponsor. We've got Loot Crates here. We're going to go ahead and do a quick unboxing and then, Sam, you can tell us a little bit about it.
-SAM-
After the unboxing?
-MATT-
Sure! This is the--
-TALIESIN-
A Predator bottle opener!
-MARISHA-
It's a little Logan!
-MATT-
It's pretty awesome little-- it's a heavy one! It looks like a die-cast, an actual metal, die-cast Wolverine.
-SAM-
My son is going to love it.
-MATT-
This is actually, for the size of Wolverine, this is actually weight-effective. It's accurate.
-SAM-
What theme is this?
-TALIESIN-
Primal.
-TRAVIS-
Primal.
-SAM-
Primal. Hey, look! This looks an awful lot like the shirt that Travis is wearing right now!
-TRAVIS-
I got mine early, bitches!
-MATT-
Look at that! Crispin's been smeared all over Taliesin.
-MARISHA-
Is that a Winston shirt?!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
Holy shit!
-TALIESIN-
Right there.
-MATT-
That's pretty rad.
-MARISHA-
It's a Winston shirt!
-MATT-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
That's cool.
-TRAVIS-
I love the raptor electrified fence.
-MARISHA-
This is so going on our--
-TRAVIS-
Like, our backyard fence.
-MARISHA-
Yeah! The chicken coop!
-TALIESIN-
This is going on my chicken coop, man!
-MARISHA-
On your chicken coop! That's so cute!
-SAM-
You saw this already?
-MATT-
If you have a motorcycle, this should go on there so you can ride with raptors through the forest. That's the way to do it.
-SAM-
This is a really good box! The bottle opener's really cool.
-MATT-
The bottle opener's cool.
-TRAVIS-
Predator helmet? Yes!
-SAM-
It's a Predator bottle opener.
-TALIESIN-
My brother was singing the praises of this box this week.
-MARISHA-
Oh, man. This is a good box!
-SAM-
This is a Primal pin.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, no! Does it do--
-MARISHA-
Does it turn into a raptor?
-TALIESIN-
It turns into a dinosaur! The box turns into a dinosaur.
-MATT-
Like all good boxes should.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to see if I can do this really, really quickly.
-SAM-
What is this? There's a secret, hidden puzzle thing. The pages are blank and it says "follow your instinct". What could it be?
-MATT-
Is it scratch and sniff?
-SAM-
I'm intrigued!
-MARISHA-
Is it scratch and sniff?
-SAM-
No, it's not.
-MATT-
It is definitely not.
-TRAVIS-
Follow your instinct: lootcrate.com.
-MARISHA-
Tell us about Loot Crate, Sam.
-SAM-
Sam? Oh, Sam's not here.
-SAM-
I'm sorry, I think you mean--
-TRAVIS-
What the fuck.
-SAM-
(robot voice) SAM 3000! (laughter)
You ready? (laughter)
(robot voice) Greetings, humans of the year 2017! I am Sentient Advertising Mechanoid 5000 and I am from the future! Sent from the Planet Lootcrateopia to ensure you simple humans choose the correct time path. After the Water War of 2018, the Oilpocalypse of 2019, and the Oprah Winfrey Rebellion of 2020, your world was plunged into a hellscape that lasted 2000 years. (Sam voice) There's more. (Robot voice) Until the just and tolerant overlords of Fortune 500 company Loot Crate, in their altruistic wisdom, united the factions and brought peace to all by sending every human a Loot Crate. The gesture worked, and all other Fortune 500 companies: Apple, Kroger, the evil warmongers of Johnson &amp; Johnson-- (laughter)
(robot voice) -- perished under the might of the Loot Crate armies. Now, all live in harmony.
You humans must begin the peaceful transition by visiting primitive webpage lootcrate.com/criticalrole. And use promo code CRITICALROLE for 10% off this month's crate theme, Investigate. Items from Stranger Things, Batman, The X-Files, and Marvel's Jessica Jones. That include a figure, detective must-haves, and our awesome monthly tee and pin. I must return to my timeline. Until we meet in the future, good crate, and may the loot be with you! Bleep! Blop! Blorp! Bleep! Blop!
-TRAVIS-
Yes! Yes!
-SAM-
Oh, what, did I miss something?
-MATT-
You just missed him!
-MARISHA-
Sam, when did you get here?
-TRAVIS-
You blacked out, man; there was a time traveler in this space!
-SAM-
Wow!
-MARISHA-
It was crazy!
-MATT-
I am a little disappointed you decided to reveal your character for the next campaign so early.
-TALIESIN-
So you're going to do a Loot Crate ad, man.
-TRAVIS-
That was so-- That was new.
-MATT-
Thank you very much, Sam.
-SAM-
New character.
-MATT-
And thank you, Loot Crate, for sponsoring this chaos. All right, let's get this going. We put up a survey starting this week to try and get a feel for the community at large of you guys. Get a feel for who's watching, where they're watching it from, what kind of future merch ideas you might want to see from the show. We want to get a scope of what the Critter base is, where it comes from, and how many of you are out there. So, if you get a chance, if you haven't yet, go to geekandsundry.com/crsurvey. We're running it until April 18th, so get on there and let us know about you!
-TALIESIN-
It's pretty short and you can do it during the break, maybe?
-TRAVIS-
I did it in a minute.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, it's pretty short, pretty easy.
-MATT-
WonderCon is in two days, for us! It's this weekend in Anaheim; we're going to be there Saturday, at 2PM to 3PM at The Arena to do our Talks Machina live panel, with a bunch of us up there. With delivery coffee for Taliesin.
-SAM-
Get! You're in the shot, you're in the shot! (laughter)
-MATT-
Thank you, Eric.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you Eric! Loot Crate!
-MATT-
So if you're coming, go ahead and check it out. If you can't be there, that's okay, I think we're filming the panel, I think.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it'll get put up at a later time.
-MARISHA-
It is going to be aired during Talks Machina this week, in place of our normal show, so if you miss it, you get to see the full panel in its entirety.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Right, we look forward to seeing you guys there in a couple of days, so yay! Wednesday Club, Taliesin!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, we don't actually have a-- that happened. We don't actually have a subject yet, we're going through and taking suggestions from Twitter and from the chatroom, but we will have that probably figured out, I'm going to guess tomorrow and probably a graphic on Monday, but Wednesday 12 to 2, we're talking comics, and it's going to be fun, so we'll just-- come and join us and we'll chill.
-MARISHA-
(accent) Talking comics.
-TALIESIN-
(accent) Talking comics.
-MARISHA-
(accent) Talking comics.
-MATT-
Great. I also want to mention the show Round Table, it's up on Alpha if you want to check it out. Me, Eric, Matt Colville, Adam Koebel, Mark Hulmes, Satine Phoenix, TJ Storm, a bunch of really amazing, talented GMs from all different walks of life, all just talking about different themes about gaming, tabletop gaming, and what it means community, what it means philosophically, what experiences can, you know, be improved or lessened by it. It's a lot of great conversations.
If you get a chance to check it out, I recommend it, I'm on a couple of them. Signal Boost has a ringtone if I recall, right?
-MARISHA-
We released a ringtone (laughs).
-MATT-
As well as--?
-MARISHA-
As well as-- so you can now get our theme song as your ringtone on iTunes. We also released a free screensaver, that you can download, based off of the old flying toasters.
-MATT-
The After Dark, yeah.
-MARISHA-
After Dark, yeah, flying toasters.
-MATT-
We're still waiting for the WinAmp--
-MARISHA-
The WinAmp skin was cancelled, but we're working on it.
-MATT-
Working on that one.
-MARISHA-
But yeah, we-- just because we thought it was funny. That's how we choose to spend our free time, is releasing free screensavers, yeah, so go do that.
-MATT-
Awesome, thank you Marisha. Want to pass this along: Will Friedle, our good friend here, who plays Kash, Kashaw, he's going to be at the Wales Comic Con in the UK, April 8th and 9th, so a bunch of UK Critters, if you want to go to Wales Comic Con and say hi to Kash, and tell him how much you like him and his body of work, as well as his awesome roleplaying on the show, go do it! Because he's awesome, and you should go do that.
Me, Marisha and Taliesin actually were just announced for MomoCon this year, May 25th to the 28th, in Atlanta, Georgia. So, if you guys over in the Georgia area are willing to make the journey, we'll be there at MomoCon, doing panels and signings and all kinds of fun, general hangout stuff, so come see us there. And last but not least, reminder, Talks Machina is Tuesday nights at 7PM Pacific here, where our wonderful Brian Wayne Foster brings us in in chunks, with occasional members of the community to talk all things nerdy and Critical Role-related, so come check it out on Twitch, or Alpha.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) He brings us in chunks, that was phenomenally worded.
-MATT-
He brings us in chunks!
-TRAVIS-
Murderous.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Very murderous.
-TRAVIS-
Very Dexter of you.
-MATT-
I like to leave it vague, open to interpretation.
-MARISHA-
Very shark-chummy.
-MATT-
It's what I'm here for, guys. And that, I believe, is the end of our announcements.
Woo, okay.
-LIAM-
No, I have one last announcement.
-MATT-
Shit, no! Liam! All right, what is it?
-LIAM-
I would like to announce that my father is hiding, six feet away from me, over there from my Skype window. He rolled very high in his stealth, and while he may not understand what my career is, he believes that I have one.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Thank you, Liam. We've accomplished a lot tonight, I'm glad we could do this together.
(laughs) All righty. So, without further ado, let's dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.
[opening credits]
And welcome back. So, picking up where we left off last week: Vox Machina, in tying up loose ends after the end of the Chroma Conclave and the completion of Keyleth's Aramente, they knew that there was, out there, somewhere in the Hells, an infernal being, a rakshasa known as Hotis, that they had encountered previously in the past, and was going to eventually claim vengeance on them, if they did not get to it fast. As such, through their research, they found that it most likely seemed to reside on the second layer of the Hells: Dis. Ruling under Dispater, one of the Archdevils.
And after gathering your materials, doing a bit of prep, you transitioned into the actual plane of the Nine Hells of Baator, into the City of Dis.
Upon wandering the streets and trying to blend in through various alterations to your physical forms, you eventually found your way to-- after avoiding a couple of possible confrontations in the street-- to a tavern-like location, where you decided not to order the meats that were being devoured by a couple of devilish entities, and instead the other thing.
(laughter)
Which involved both Taryon and Keyleth having their first taste of soul. And eventually Percival on the way out, too. You encountered the owner of the establishment: a dark-haired, red-skinned, horned gentleman, wings folded against his back, who was eager to rent you a place to stay for the time being. And you guys decided to figure out what your plans were. At which point, Freddie and Greg-- Percival and Grog-- went downstairs to have a conversation with this entity, where he revealed himself to be named Ipkesh, and was interested in possibly working out sort of a criss-cross, quid pro quo-type negotiation with your team. After returning to discuss the possibilities of this up in your chambers, Keyleth made her way out to locate the possible location of Hotis as a workaround. As she exited the front exterior of the establishment and went into an alleyway to attempt to transform, she found herself followed by a chain devil and some sort of a somewhat scarred and mutated-looking dwarf. They confronted you and were asking about their interest in "the white one", seeming speaking about one of your companions, Vax, who had taken on the form of an albino tiefling when you entered the plane. We left off at a tense moment, and that's where we pick up this week. As you stand in the darkened, shadowed, uncomfortably hot air in the center of this alleyway behind these buildings, crushed in these very thin spaces with what looks to be a thinning exit behind you, and these two devilish entities--or devilish entity and some sort of a messed-up dwarf-- beginning to flank you with what looks to be grotesque murder or thrill of coming pain in their eyes and faces-- What do you want to do? (laughter)
As you are alone--
-SAM-
She'll talk her way out of it, like she always does! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
I'll have a panic attack is what (clears throat) I want to do. All right. Fuck me. Okay.
-SAM-
That's a good way to start.
-MARISHA-
Ugh, don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. I am going to continue with my original plan.
Can't-- Getting cotton mouth. And, (laughs) And I'm going to slowly start from the top down, transforming-- forming--
-SAM-
Wow, wow.
-MARISHA-
Shut up, Sam!
-MATT-
Via, what are-- what are you using? What are you using?
-SAM-
(laughs) This is rough already!
-MATT-
Are you using Alter Self?
-MARISHA-
No, I want to use Shapechange.
-MATT-
So you're casting Shapechange?
-MARISHA-
Yes. Right? Because I can't Alter Self into an erinyes.
-MATT-
No, you cannot. But however, you did not quite cast Shapechange last time--
-MARISHA-
Right.
-MATT-
-- we had spoken. So you're doing it now.
-MARISHA-
So I'm doing it now.
-MATT-
Okay. So. As they both begin to slowly flank from the sides of the alleyway, and you're holding your ground, insisting that this 'white one' they're asking about belongs to you, they didn't seem to buy your attempt at claiming territory, so you begin to mutter the incantation beneath your breath, your hands move, and you watch as you do so, the chains of the chain devil begin to-- continue to grind and shift around it, like a hundred serpents of grinding metal, and the dwarf figure, she begins sauntering up on the other side with this heavy limp, as you watch the flesh tearing with small tendrils revealing beneath, like a series of worms are almost emerging from various folds and gashes in the flesh of the arm.
-SAM-
Ugh.
-MATT-
You complete your Shapechange spell as they're pulling in on you: what do you turn into?
-MARISHA-
An erinyes.
-MATT-
Oh sh-- okay!
-SAM-
What was that? What was that? What's that do? What's an erinyes?
-MARISHA-
It's that thing that we fought in the City of Brass.
-SAM-
Ooh! Cool!
-MATT-
Yeah, they have Challenge Level 12, so you can do that. Okay. So.
-MARISHA-
There was like the devil that we fought--
-LIAM-
Lady demon with Pit Fiend.
-MATT-
Yeah, the one that the Pit Fiend summoned next to it. So you have actually encountered it.
-TRAVIS-
That winged biatch.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, the one that you squared up against with, for most of the time.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, she didn't want none.
-MARISHA-
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
-MATT-
As you finish the incantation, your skin goes to a pale white, your eyes becoming dark, deep red with these little burning, golden coals for pupils. The rest of your skin grows fair but thick, with a very, very fine series of scales across it as these giant black, red wings emerge from your back and unfold. As they extend past you in both directions, enveloping both sides of this alleyway, both the chain devil and the dwarfish entity stop in their tracks and take a couple of steps back, looking at you intensely.
-MARISHA-
(deeper voice) You know, I never did catch your name.
What do they call the two of you?
-MATT-
Make an intimidation check. With advantage.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh, that's good! That's a good plan!
-SAM-
Advantage? Do it, do it, do it!
-MATT-
Because you are, you look like a higher ranking devil.
-TRAVIS-
You got this. In the City of Dis.
-MARISHA-
You got Dis!
-TALIESIN-
You got Dis.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I'll take that 18.
And I think my intimidation's an eight-- No, it's a seven. So-- 25.
-MATT-
(laughs) 25.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Wow!
-MATT-
So, as you asked for their name, the chain devil-- the chains begin to slow and come to a halt, and what was originally curling upward in this aggressive stance begin to just fall limp to its sides, and just takes another step back. "No need to worry, we apologize for the intrusion."
-MARISHA-
Are you sure? Because I would love to know, maybe add you to the collection.
-MATT-
The chain devil bows its head and begins to step back, and you see it ushering its hand this way, towards the dwarf, the dwarf which is looking confused and begins to hobble backward. And they both just back out of the alleyway in a very submissive, apologetic physicality, without even saying a word.
-MARISHA-
Oh, what's the matter! Where're you going?
-SAM-
Just let 'em, just let 'em go!
-MARISHA-
And then I turn around, and I (strained) just start walking cool--
-SAM-
You can fly!
-MARISHA-
(whimpers) Yeah, I can fly! That's also, this is a concentration spell.
-MATT-
Yes it is.
-MARISHA-
So, I can't do-- Okay, so I'm going to, as I-- Is anyone looking around? Anyone looking around right now?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-MARISHA-
God damn it. 22.
-MATT-
22. You glance up, and right on the edge of one of the three- to four-story curved iron towers, you see what appears to be an impish-like creature perched on the end with what looks to be faint, shimmering gold armor that's just peering down at you from the top of the alley.
-MARISHA-
I look at it.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-MARISHA-
And I just nod.
-MATT-
It doesn't react. Its head twitches a little bit, and it just sets back in itself, looking at you, its eyes these gleaming black, shining discs in the darkness.
-MARISHA-
And then I start heading back towards the tavern.
-MATT-
It just watches you. And as you exit the alleyway from where you came, the two devils that attempted to assail you there, no longer anywhere in sight, the--
-MARISHA-
Before I round the corner, I want to just take and do a quick Shapechange again into the tiefling that I was.
-MATT-
Okay. As your form changes as you turn the corner--
-MARISHA-
Into the tavern.
-MATT-
-- into the tavern. Yep.
-MARISHA-
Go upstairs to the rest of the group.
-SAM-
Nice!
-TRAVIS-
Did you pee on yourself?
-MARISHA-
(panicked gasping) Okay! Okay!
-TALIESIN-
What? What happened? How'd it go?
-MARISHA-
I didn't make it far! I didn't make it far.
-TRAVIS-
You ate the meat, didn't you?
-MARISHA-
Woo!
-LIAM-
Well, how far are we talking about?
-MARISHA-
I made it around the corner, and the two devils that seemed to be very interested in you, Vax, cornered me-- (nervous laugh)
-LIAM-
Me?
-MARISHA-
Huh?
-LIAM-
In me? Why?
-MARISHA-
I have a feeling it has something to do with your deity.
-LIAM-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
What? Your deity? Why?
-MARISHA-
I think they can tell that Vax is special. I think-- He has value down here.
-TRAVIS-
You have value?! (laughter)
-LIAM-
It's the first I'm hearing about it, trust me.
-MARISHA-
They said they were interested in 'the white one.' And I couldn't help but notice that you were turning quite a few heads when we were walking through town.
-LIAM-
Well, do you think that's because of the Raven Queen? Or is it because of the choice of appearance I picked? I mean, we've met an albino tiefling before, it didn't seem like that outlandish a choice.
-MARISHA-
I don't think it has anything to do with the way you looked.
-TALIESIN-
I'm not entirely sure. I mean, they didn't react-- Did they react strangely to you when we came into the bar?
-LIAM-
Not that I noticed, no.
-TRAVIS-
So does that mean that he has to change again now?
-TALIESIN-
No.
-TRAVIS-
No?
-MARISHA-
I don't think it matters what he turns into, I think people will be able to tell the aura that he carries with him.
-TRAVIS-
What? A bit like a process of divination-- (laughter)
-- like, he changes, and then we know what it is or not, what?
-TALIESIN-
I think that's actually very impressive, it is actually a process of divination, technically, that's just very--
-SAM-
Some sound reasoning.
-TALIESIN-
Somehow you wandered right back to it.
-TRAVIS-
Don't lose your wits down here, it's real important.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-LIAM-
This is just an extra wrinkle into a larger problem. So, what's the move now?
-MARISHA-
Well, I can do this for about another 55 minutes! Before we'd have to sleep before I can do it again!
-SAM-
Do we have to go anywhere? Are we late to any appointments?
-TRAVIS-
I forgot what it was you left to go do, actually! (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
She was going to research the notion of other options other than dealing with the deal we have downstairs.
-TRAVIS-
Right!
-MARISHA-
I was going to go see if I could get a bead on where Hotis is. Oh! What, guys, check this out, this is what I freaked 'em out with. And I go back into the erinyes form.
-MATT-
You watch the wings (whoosh) unfurl, her skin going pale--
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MARISHA-
(deeper voice) Check it out. Check it out, that's pretty hot, right? It makes my--
-SAM-
That is amazing!
-MARISHA-
-- it makes my voice a little smokey when I'm down here too, right?
-SAM-
Whoa! Whoa!
-MARISHA-
I know.
-SAM-
What are you right now?!
-MARISHA-
I'm an erinyes.
-SAM-
How do you spell that?! Doty, take that down! Erinyes!
-TRAVIS-
How do you say it?
-MARISHA-
It's with an 'e'.
-TALIESIN-
E-R-I-N-Y-E-S.
-TRAVIS-
Ear-in-es.
-TALIESIN-
Air-in-es.
-MARISHA-
Erin. Like Erin-yes!
-SAM-
Wow.
-LIAM-
Yeah, it's got yes-bait right in.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Well. Do you still want to look into other options, or do we want to just-- We could take the deal. We could reverse the deal.
-TRAVIS-
Wait, you said they like left you alone once you changed into that thing?
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Well, why didn't you just keep going, then?
-MARISHA-
Well, changing into this thing meant that I had to drop concentration on my Locate Creature spell.
-TRAVIS-
Ohh.
-MARISHA-
I can only concentrate on one thing at a time. It gets-- Especially this, it's a lot to mentally focus on.
-TALIESIN-
It's very impressive.
-SAM-
You know, in my readings of this place, the Hells-- Of any hell, really (laughs)-- They typically are, at least in literature, reflected as horrible places where lots of bad things happen wherever you go. So having a deal presented in front of us that is not horrible is, I think, a pretty winning deal. I mean, I feel like we're already ahead of the game if we are not being actively murdered during the course of events.
-TALIESIN-
I would also like to point out that the definition of 'research', in this instance, is just reading the notes that I took last week, reading and doing actual research.
-SAM-
I do my own reading, thank you.
-TALIESIN-
You did! You did reading of the notes I wrote.
-SAM-
Well, then I guess we're in accord. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, don't you, like, brainy buddies just like exchange notes every day, anyway?
-SAM-
Of course!
-TALIESIN-
I don't feel like I should have lost that one.
-MARISHA-
I noticed--
-TALIESIN-
(sighs)
-MARISHA-
Just let it go, Percy. I noticed we're being watched, I think at every turn. There was a little imp guy watching me when I came in.
-TALIESIN-
Was it actually an imp? Imps are very common. Everyone's being watched, it's a city under surveillance.
-LIAM-
We saw an imp back in Krieg's house, did it look like that?
-TALIESIN-
Gold armor? Or wasn't that the one at Krieg's house?
-MATT-
It did not have gold armor, the one that you saw at Krieg's.
-TALIESIN-
Which one did we see? Was it just-- I don't--
-LIAM-
The little bastard in the library at Krieg's house.
-MATT-
Well, that was in Krieg's-- Technically it wasn't in Krieg's house--
-LIAM-
No?
-MATT-
That was in father, what's the character's--
-TRAVIS-
It was upstairs in the--
-MATT-
Yeah, it was the first-- when you first came to Emon, it was the ally to your father, Vax.
-TALIESIN-
Oh!
-LIAM-
Oh, that's right.
-MARISHA-
Oh, shit, that's right, your dad!
-MATT-
And he was the one that was found slain, or was in the process of being killed by--
-LIAM-
That's right, that's right.
-MATT-
-- by entities.
-TALIESIN-
In the basement?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Oh my god, that was a long time ago!
-MARISHA-
A long time ago.
-LIAM-
The slaying, right. The slaying was in the basement, but the imp was in a library upstairs--
-MATT-
Yes! Yes.
-LIAM-
-- in our house. And he was just a little prick.
-TRAVIS-
I forgot about that. I kept a ring off that demon that we killed. It's in the bag of holding.
-MARISHA-
Wait, did you really?
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
That's like seven haircuts ago.
-MARISHA-
Well, get that--
-SAM-
Whip it out.
-MARISHA-
Get that-- can I-- Get that out. Get that out.
-TRAVIS-
Why, what do you want?
-SAM-
Might be useful.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'll trade you something for it.
-MARISHA-
Percy--
-TALIESIN-
My glasses.
-MARISHA-
Your-- (laughs) (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
You! You! I'm not going to fall for that!
-TALIESIN-
It was worth-- the joke was worth the ring alone, I would imagine. We were going to give it back, we just want to see it.
-TRAVIS-
So that big demon, that like body slammed me on that spike? Piece of shit. I took this ring off of his finger, forever ago. And I kept it. I take it out.
-SAM-
Let's have a look! I'll cast Identify on it.
-MATT-
Okay. The ring has no specific magical properties to it, but it is a signet of some kind.
There is a symbol on it-- Roll a religion check, actually.
-TALIESIN-
Can I aid with a history or religion as well?
-TRAVIS-
Sorry, that's from like, three years ago.
-SAM-
19.
-TALIESIN-
Can I help with him with that? History or religion?
-MATT-
This would be religion.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
That's one of the oldest things in this bag.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
There's only one other thing that's older.
-TALIESIN-
An 11 on top of that, so--
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
What's the one thing that's older?
-TRAVIS-
It's an onyx statue that we found down in the cell that you were in.
-MATT-
That he was in, yeah. So, the two of you both conjecturing about it, the symbol here is one that you picked up specifically in the tome you did research earlier. It is the symbol of Asmodeus.
-TALIESIN-
It is the symbol of Asmodeus, I would have instantly recognized it, at this point.
-SAM-
Asmodeus. I was going to say that as well.
-TALIESIN-
You, of course you were going to say Asmodeus, because it's like written six times in my notes, and I'm literally staring at a sketch of it in my notes.
-MATT-
Asmo-day-us.
-SAM-
I feel like we're sympatico on this.
-TRAVIS-
Can we use it? Is it something that'll get us like, a backstage pass to an audience of some kind?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take a long look at this thing. Is this some sort of mark of-- Is this a marker? Some sort of favor marker? Is this a signet of stature? Is this a-- You don't just put this on anything.
-TRAVIS-
It's mine, don't forget.
-MATT-
It seems, from best you can tell-- Make an intelligence check, actually.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-SAM-
I should probably assist.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, please.
-TRAVIS-
Yep, me too.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yes please.
-SAM-
We got two natural ones.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
13!
-MARISHA-
Did you really?
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Holy shit!
-TALIESIN-
It's a nose ring!
-SAM-
I think it's a, uh. A contact lens!
-TALIESIN-
I think that it is, in fact, a-- some sort of-- I don't know, it's a-- Napkin ring.
(laughs) For tiny napkins.
-MATT-
As far as you guys know, it looks pretty damn important. That's the only thing you can ascertain.
-MARISHA-
Let me, let me see if I can get something out of it.
-TALIESIN-
That's fine, I don't care.
-MARISHA-
Can I scry on it?
-SAM-
Scry?
-MARISHA-
Like scry and see if it shows me something?
-TALIESIN-
Oh! Object scry?
-MATT-
Let me see.
-MARISHA-
Is that-- a thing I-- no?
-MATT-
I mean, if you focus on an item, you can use that item to try an improve a scrying attempt if you're looking for a specific individual or location.
-MARISHA-
Individual.
-MATT-
But I don't think the Scrying spell directly allows you to, to--
-TALIESIN-
There is a spell that does that, though-- Object History.
-SAM-
Yeah, we don't have that.
-MARISHA-
I don't have that.
-TRAVIS-
If you're curious, the person it belonged to is dead.
-SAM-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
We killed him.
-MARISHA-
Oh, I know.
-TALIESIN-
The symbol on this object, though, is more or less the ruler of this dimension, so it could be useful for something.
-SAM-
Why don't we keep it handy, no pun intended, and we'll just flash it if we get in trouble, and see if that helps us.
-TRAVIS-
How is that a pun?
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I was actually thinking the same thing, I don't understand how that was--
-SAM-
It's a ring. I said handy.
-TRAVIS-
That's a stretch.
-LIAM-
I caught it.
(laughter)
I'm sorry to say.
-SAM-
Well. Are we taking this deal, or are we...
not?
-TRAVIS-
Are we doing it on our own?
-MARISHA-
You know, this imp that I saw did have sparkly gold armor, he may be like an important imp. I'm just saying, I feel like everyone's here wanting to make a deal. It might be good to talk to others.
-LIAM-
Vex, you're being awfully quiet, what do you think we should do right now? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Yeah, Vex!
-MATT-
Vex, at this point, is watching the whole thing, and she goes, "Well, to be perfectly honest, I haven't heard much detail about this deal that you apparently seemed to make. What do we make of the deal?"
-TALIESIN-
The owner of this establishment we're staying in works for a man he doesn't like. Is curious what would happen if he wasn't working for that man, if he was suddenly, for reasons, unavailable. And for that, we would probably be arrested, if we dealt with it inappropriately, and we would be in a position to be-- make our enemy accessible, I suppose. We have to be a bit cagey, there are ears, apparently, everywhere. Even here.
-MARISHA-
I feel like we don't need to make a deal to go murder someone to get arrested. I feel like I could just go streaking in the street and just say words, and we would get arrested.
-TALIESIN-
As, actually--
-TRAVIS-
That's true.
-TALIESIN-
Strangely, excited by that plan as I am--
-MARISHA-
Why do we need to commit this crime, and then suffer the apt consequences?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but Keyleth, once we're arrested, he's supposed to, like, shuffle us in, y'know, on the low-low, into--
-MARISHA-
Can he get us out?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Well, where we need to be, yeah. Out never came up.
-MARISHA-
Out never came up?!
-TALIESIN-
You're our out. We leave all of this behind once all that's taken care of.
-MARISHA-
Then why do we need him as our in?
-TRAVIS-
Because we have no other plan at this point.
-TALIESIN-
At this point we have no other plan.
-TRAVIS-
You were supposed to go find something, (singsong) but you got followed by demons.
-MARISHA-
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I could do-- attempt something similar. Potentially with a higher-level version of my Locate Creature spell--
-TRAVIS-
Oh?
-MARISHA-
-- which is Find the Path, which could get us close. Potentially.
-TRAVIS-
What if the guy he wants us to kill is like a real piece of shit?
-TALIESIN-
They're all pieces of shit!
-SAM-
Everything down here is a piece of shit.
-TRAVIS-
Does anybody have a problem with that? It's just like, y'know, piece of shit: (killing noise), and he's gone.
-TALIESIN-
The only problem I have with it--
-SAM-
I like it.
-TRAVIS-
Thank you, Tary.
-TALIESIN-
-- and the only reason I'm even being vaguely hesitant about any of this is because they're all pieces of shit, including the one that we're making any sort of bargain with.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
And they are professional bargainers, and I know we're missing something.
-TRAVIS-
We kill him, too.
-MARISHA-
It's a Lawful Evil dimension. If he wants his boss dead, that means that there's going to be someone else above him. If we kill one guy, who's all going to want to kill us?
-TRAVIS-
Did he ask, like, a decision by a certain time?
-TALIESIN-
I don't recall-- So, I said I would have it within a day or so, if I recall--
-MATT-
Yeah, you said 'fairly promptly.'
-TRAVIS-
Well, fuck, we've got a day! Let's go explore, see what we can find.
-TALIESIN-
And if we're going to decide to trust him, we could also show him the ring and see what he makes of it.
-TRAVIS-
Not the ring! God, not the ring-- I mean, I, fuck, I totally forgot about that ring until now.
-MARISHA-
He's literally still holding it in his hand in front of your face, you just--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I need it back.
-SAM-
What will you do with it?
-TRAVIS-
Me?
-SAM-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to wear it!
-SAM-
All right!
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. Does it fit on any of me giant, Oscar Meyer fingers? (laughter)
-MATT-
It fits partway down your pinkie, but it gets caught on, like, the first knuckle.
-MARISHA-
Ooh, look at you! Oh my gosh! Wow.
-MATT-
It's like he went to Claire's.
-TRAVIS-
Property of Asmodeus! Ass-modeus--
-TALIESIN-
This never ends well. Let's forego disguises.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, wait, you ready to go?
-TALIESIN-
We're going to just drain ourselves the more we pretend to be something we're not, and obviously it's not helping us not attract attention.
-TRAVIS-
Vax, you got any problem with that?
-LIAM-
I mean, I don't know what the deal is with the people who are interested in me. I can't tell if one's better or worse. But we're just going to go waltz out into town and see what happens, is that the idea?
-TALIESIN-
Well, we could-- Keyleth could keep her wings and armor, and they'd be probably, possibly, less likely to question any of us if we're walking around with someone of reasonable stature.
-SAM-
If I might remind you: for 50 minutes, now, at this point now, right? So then we're all dead.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, then we're all dead.
-MARISHA-
Well, we just-- It's like curfew. We have to be home in about 50 minutes.
-TRAVIS-
What about you? Do you have like a magic jock strap you can rip off and change into something?
-SAM-
I've already done that. We're all tieflings because of me.
-TRAVIS-
Not me, bitch.
-SAM-
You're-- abnormal.
-TRAVIS-
Oh. Thank you.
-LIAM-
Kiki, the prison that you saw, did you get an idea for how big it is?
-MARISHA-
The what? The prison?
-LIAM-
The prison. That we need to break into or get arrested and pulled into--
-MARISHA-
I didn't see how big. It seemed immense, and like it was probably pretty big underground? But I couldn't-- can't be for sure.
-TALIESIN-
I would say it would be safe to assume that a prison in hell would be so big that there would be sayings such as 'as big as filling-- try attempting to fill a prison in hell.' I feel like this is just-- I think we're like walking into idioms, at this point.
-SAM-
But if this gentleman, if I may call him a gentleman, can escort us to the right cell block, or whatever, that might be very, very handy. I don't want to spend any more time in hell than we have to, and as much as I usually hate employees revolting against their employer, I feel like we've got a bird in the hand, so to speak, and we should strike while the iron is hot, if I can use many, many cliches all at once.
-TALIESIN-
Wait for it, wait for it.
-ALL-
Hey!
-LAURA-
What's going on?
-TRAVIS-
Hi!
-LAURA-
I was listening in the car!
-SAM-
We're about to Say Yes to the Dress, and go and follow this plan, I think.
-LAURA-
It was the one? It was the one?!
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, do you want to take the contract? And we go kill (burps) big shit guy and go to prison? Or do we try and, like, take a day and see what we can find on our own, without giving ourselves over to this-- arrangement?
-SAM-
(whispers) I don't want to walk around this place!
-LAURA-
(South African accent) We're going to kill the big guy. Oh god! I'm in South African.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you are. Vax.
-LAURA-
Ah! (babbling)
-TRAVIS-
What's your vote?
-LIAM-
Well, well, hold on, I've got one more spitball idea. Vex?
-LAURA-
(accent still off) Yeah! Yes.
-LIAM-
That gate stone that we've used so many times, does that only work on the material plane? Does it work--
-LAURA-
Well, here's the thing, darling. I gave the other gate stone to Scanlan.
-LIAM-
Right!
-MARISHA-
It won't get us out of here, no.
-TALIESIN-
We don't have one.
-LIAM-
Would it take us off this plane, though, or no?
-LAURA-
Well, it would take one person off this plane.
-MATT-
It would only take one person, and they have to be on the same plane of existence.
-LAURA-
So, no, it wouldn't take anyone anywhere.
-MATT-
You would know that. Based on the enchantment.
-LIAM-
So that's a dead end. All right.
-LAURA-
Also, I heard you guys talking about the guys with the gold armor?
-TRAVIS-
Uh-huh.
-LIAM-
While you were standing two feet away?
-LAURA-
While I was standing right here, I heard you guys talking about it?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
And those guys, they're guards of the city! Those imps in the gold armor, we were warned about those guys!
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
We were?
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-SAM-
Well, why didn't you chime in before?! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, fucking speak up.
-LAURA-
Well, I wanted to! But I was biting my nails really hard.
-MARISHA-
You know, we have a day or so. Does anyone else think that we should maybe not take the first deal that presents itself in the first tavern that we step into in the city? Does that not seem super convenient?
-TRAVIS-
I mean, what are our chances of walking around town and going like, 'hey, that prison, 'right? Right over--'?
-MARISHA-
I mean-- (transforming sound) (deeper voice) We've got about 50 minutes, if we still want to go.
-MATT-
45.
-LIAM-
I mean, also, if we want to get, y'know, pinched and put into this prison, what are the chances that we-- if we start shit here, are we just going to get killed in the streets? Or dragged off? It doesn't seem very solid to me, but I don't have any other idea.
-TRAVIS-
All right, time for a vote!
-SAM-
I agree.
-TRAVIS-
Tary, what's your vote?
-SAM-
I say we take this deal, kill that employer, and go to prison. Oh my god--
-TRAVIS-
Percy?
-LIAM-
Jeez, Tary, you've gone straight gangsta in so little time.
-SAM-
Well, I just want to get the fuck out of here and go back home so I can enjoy some wine!
-TALIESIN-
Starting to crack a bit.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Percy, what's your vote?
-TALIESIN-
I vote we take the deal.
-TRAVIS-
Keyleth?
-MARISHA-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Keyleth!
-MARISHA-
I think an extra day of walking around this city could potentially save us years in hell that--
-TRAVIS-
I don't need an explanation, jesus.
-TALIESIN-
I say we take the deal at sundown.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. Vax?
-MARISHA-
We don't take the deal.
-LIAM-
I mean, I really don't see the harm in spending another day here and getting the lay of the land.
-TRAVIS-
Vex?
-LAURA-
I vote for-- For another day here.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LAURA-
But if we don't find any leads, we take it.
-TRAVIS-
I vote for taking the contract! Me and Tary, we're of a like mind.
-TALIESIN-
No, I was just swinging. I swing back.
-SAM-
What? You swing back?!
-TALIESIN-
I said I'd take the day.
-MARISHA-
He said he wants the day.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Bullshit. All right, we take the day.
-SAM-
Well, Doty hasn't voted yet.
-LAURA-
Neither has Trinket.
-LIAM-
What, is Doty the center that breaks the tie?
-SAM-
Maybe they should arm wrestle for it.
-LAURA-
Maybe they should.
-SAM-
Doty.
-TRAVIS-
Giant grizzly bear.
-SAM-
Arm wrestle that bear.
-MATT-
Turns towards you and Trinket goes-- (bear grunting)
-LAURA-
Trinket's arms don't bend that way.
Trinket, you can do it.
-MATT-
Saunters up and looks up at Doty-- (bear sniffing, snorts) Fogs up the metal for a second on the outside--
-LAURA-
Wait, I haven't chosen my dice yet.
-MATT-
Choose your dice. (chuckles)
-SAM-
(snorts) Give her 35 minutes.
-LAURA-
Just hold on, I just need like a few--
-TRAVIS-
Just pick one.
-SAM-
She needs a bucket of Vaseline, a feather, preferably from a dove, and 35-40 minutes.
-LAURA-
Okay. Why's all my stuff in different order?
-MATT-
All right, so the-- it takes roughly five or so minutes to try and bring one of the nearby tables over without burning the shit out of your palms--
-TRAVIS-
Oh right.
-MATT-
-- that could possibly facilitate an arm wrestling match between a giant metal man and a grizzly bear.
-LAURA-
Oh-- but, wait wait wait wait. Doty's not going to get any advantage on this because he's been leaning against a door, right?
-MATT-
No, it's cooled off by now.
-LAURA-
Okay, good.
-MATT-
So, as it's all there, the giant metal man, Trinket comes up--
-SAM-
(whispers) Where's my Doty stats--
-LAURA-
Put your whole body into it, Trinket.
-MATT-
And Trinket, not really-- Trinket doesn't grasp, Trinket just goes-- and just does like a claw strike at his, at his hand--
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
-- because that's what a bear does. And so the giant open palm of the automaton gets slammed by the strength of Trinket's claw and this is going to be the, one way or another, the fastest arm wrestling match you've ever seen. I need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add Trinket's strength modifier.
-LIAM-
Come on, Trinket.
-LAURA-
Come on, Trinket.
-LIAM-
Do it.
-TALIESIN-
Either way, I'm entertained. Nothing but winners.
-LAURA-
14.
-MATT-
Roll a d20 and add Doty's strength modifier.
-SAM-
Ten.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Ping! The bear's claw goes full swing, Doty's arm gets thrust back and almost seems to pop out of the socket briefly--
-TRAVIS-
Son of a bitch!
-MATT-
-- before pops it back in.
-SAM-
I must wage a complaint. That was not a regulation arm-wrestling match, they did not have elbows down--
-LAURA-
It's not a fair match, he doesn't have arm joints.
-SAM-
It's not my fault that you didn't design your robot-bear to have arm joints.
-LAURA-
He's a real bear. He's a real bear.
-SAM-
I haven't seen any evidence of that.
-LAURA-
Trinket, go pee on him. Go potty, right there.
-SAM-
Please don't, I rust in many places.
-MATT-
And this very large, looming bear just-- (aggressive bear grunting)
-LAURA-
Good boy.
-MATT-
-- looms up towards you. Do you do anything?
-SAM-
I don't.
(laughter)
I'm scared of the bear.
-MATT-
As the feeling of ever-so-slowly trickling, warm urine soaks the right side of your armored leg, Trinket's nose slowly brushes up against the side of your ear and face and goes (sniffing, grunting) (slurp) licks the side of your head and then the last little bits of trickle end as Trinket turns around and lumbers back towards Vex.
-LAURA-
How's that?
-TALIESIN-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
Did that seem real enough?
-MATT-
Which, by the way, there's now a (sizzling) it's starting to actually--
-LAURA-
Oh, that smells really awful, I'm sorry.
-MARISHA-
Do you have to make a point in the room we're sleeping in?
-LAURA-
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-TRAVIS-
This is really nice now.
-LAURA-
Well, this is Grog's room anyway.
-TALIESIN-
If we're going to go outside and take a look around, I think now is the time to do it.
-TRAVIS-
All right. Let's go.
-TALIESIN-
Do we want to show our friend downstairs our ring?
-MARISHA-
No, we can show him later.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
All right, so you guys--
-MARISHA-
Do you want me to be Poppa-- (stammering gibberish) (laughter)
I'm going to abandon that--
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-LAURA-
How's that going for you?
-TRAVIS-
Eject! Eject!
-SAM-
(whispers) Speaking in tongues.
-TALIESIN-
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
All right, she's gone.
-MARISHA-
It's been a long week.
-TRAVIS-
Do you want to what?
-TALIESIN-
They would never believe it if you told them.
-MARISHA-
Do you want me to be the erinyes?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
If you feel it start to fade we'll find some cover and let you--
-MARISHA-
Do my thing.
-TALIESIN-
-- do your thing. I don't think, I don't think that anybody here is necessarily against duplicity, I just think they're against duplicity against them, whomever they serve.
-TRAVIS-
Oh yeah, but can you be the erinyes and locate-- thing at the same time?
-MARISHA-
No.
-LAURA-
Oh, but I can, I can, oh wait, I can cast Locate Object, but not people. Does it work the same way? Would a Hotis egg-ball be an object?
-MATT-
Nope, that is specifically a creature.
-LAURA-
Would a prison be an object?
-MATT-
Mmm, no, it's a location.
-LAURA-
What about the prison door outside of Hotis' room?
-MATT-
You haven't seen it.
-MARISHA-
Sure, I got 30 minutes left of this 9th-level spell.
-TALIESIN-
We'll pop it over-- pop it out if we need.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, what if somebody comes up to you and like, thinks you're somebody and you're not, and then you gotta, like, talk.
-LAURA-
Well, she's her own person. It's not like she looks like any other one.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-LAURA-
Right?
-MARISHA-
I look like-- I currently look like that.
-LAURA-
Hot.
-TALIESIN-
A 1984 metal magazine.
-LIAM-
I mean, she's full Mystique, she can pretty much do it all at this point.
-MARISHA-
That's true, I can do it all.
-MATT-
So, what's the form you're taking?
-MARISHA-
He's right, I'll just take my regular tiefling form.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
For now.
-MATT-
So you guys gather your things--
-LAURA-
But the rest of us are normal, right? Because we don't have Alter Self anymore.
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
So if anyone asks, we belong to her.
-MARISHA-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Got it.
-TRAVIS-
Not me.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Grog--
-MARISHA-
For 30 minutes.
-TRAVIS-
All right, fine. 30. Very expensive.
-MATT-
All right. So, as you guys make your way down into the main chamber, there's one more devilish entity that's in the process of feasting on what looks to be a small cauldron of some sort of broken bone and dark purple and bluish flesh, and it's just tearing into it, as Ipkesh is at the same table where you guys previously spoke with him. He's sitting there with his same glass of wine, and as you approach, he gives a nod towards you, and he has a piece of paper on the table.
-TALIESIN-
Is this just to peruse?
-MATT-
He slides it forward. "Have a read. See if it's up to your preferences."
-SAM-
May I?
-MATT-
I will give you the piece of paper, actually.
-SAM-
No, let's mime it! (grunts) Coming!
-TALIESIN-
I was really enjoying miming reading.
-SAM-
Oh my god, it's so long.
-MATT-
(chuckles) It's a contract!
-LAURA-
Oh my god! How are we-- C'mon, really?!
-SAM-
Super long!
-TALIESIN-
I'll be fine, I can do this. Really? Okay, no. Okay, well, carry on, let's walk about while we do this. I will read out important things-- Oh, I can't walk with this, can I? I have to leave this on the table.
-MATT-
No. You have to leave this here.
-SAM-
Just give me page two!
-TRAVIS-
Do you want me to give it a look?
-MARISHA-
Aw, fuck, it's long.
-LAURA-
Did you catch it?
-TRAVIS-
Buzz.
-SAM-
He already signed.
-LAURA-
Can I roll my dice while they're reading a contract?
-TRAVIS-
(resigned) Sure.
-LAURA-
No-- No-- No-- Nope!
-TALIESIN-
I can actually faff all of this. You are an evil person.
-MARISHA-
It's like the CPA mini-game of Vox Machina!
-LIAM-
I just want to update my iPhone, jesus!
-MATT-
Kind of, yeah. Would you like me to read the contract out loud?
-SAM-
No!
-TALIESIN-
Yes!
-SAM-
It's so long, Matt!
-MARISHA-
It's so fucking long. It's got to be at-- there's like--
-SAM-
We can-- well, you read too much out loud. We will read it out loud.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
Taliesin, take it away.
-MARISHA-
I feel like we should give this to Grog.
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
All right. "This contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal--"
-MATT-
Hold on a second.
-TALIESIN-
"-- of chosen escalation for an unending period of time, or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties. Upon agreeing to and signing this contract, the recipient is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact, as is the scribe. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact, the first pact is considered complete and concluded."
-LAURA-
This is awful.
-TALIESIN-
"The contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity, allowing the recipient, should they feel inclined, to invoke and trigger the second or third pact any time thereafter through verbal acceptance in relative proximity of this contract. The obligations and parameters agreed upon within the second or third pact then become binding and immediate, to be fulfilled on part of the both parties within an agreed-upon period of time. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the second or third pact, that pact is considered complete and concluded. This contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter, maintaining any agreed-upon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pact's completion, for eternity." (big inhale) "Any violation of this contract on the part of the scribe immediately holds this contract null and void, requiring a penalty payment of 15,000 gold pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately.
Any violation of this contract on the part of the recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient, invoking the laws of this pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit. First Pact: the scribe" --your name here, Ipkesh--
-MARISHA-
It's definitely like an iPhone contract.
-TALIESIN-
"-- agrees to enable safe passage into the depths of Mentiri, specifically the Bastion of Flesh, unharmed." Bastion of Flesh. "The recipient-- your name here-- agrees to be the instrument of assassination leading to the death of-- Utugash" -- or should-- a name I will not say out loud-- "the Herald of" --something I will not say out loud-- "with the revealing or leaving of evidence that could connect or incriminate the scribe in an act or reasons for the act."
-SAM-
"Second Pact! (robot voice) The scribe, Ipkesh, agrees to--"
-ALL-
No!
-SAM-
(laughs) (normal voice) Okay. "The scribe, Ipkesh, agrees to immediately conjure forth a cadre of devils in service to the recipient--" That's us. "-- whom shall remain under the command of and dedicated to the protection of the recipient for the duration of one month!" We get a cadre of devils. "The cadre shall include four hamantula and a single osyluth. Should any devils bound within this agreed-upon cadre be slain outside of Baator, they are absolved of future service to the recipient. The recipient, our name here, agrees to introduction and installation of at least two chosen of Dispater, who have been selected by the scribe, within a place of divine worship of the scribe's choice. The recipient must not interfere with this installation upon completion, and any interference will be considered a violation of contract. Third pact!" (big inhale) "The scribe, Ipkesh, agrees to immediately impart the recipient with knowledge of ancient power beyond their grasp, enabling the use of divine powers granted under the grace of Lord Dispater that can instantly restore themselves or allies to a healthy state--" Ooh, we get health knowledge! "-- or rend the lifeforce from their opponents!"
-MARISHA-
At what cost?
-SAM-
He's giving us magic!
-MARISHA-
At what cost?
-SAM-
"These powers remain within your possession until death! The recipient--" that's us, "-- agrees to immediately lock the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit."
-MATT-
So.
-SAM-
We're selling our soul!
-MATT-
Not necessarily.
-MARISHA-
My favorite line: "This contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity." That's my favorite!
-MATT-
In theory, only one person has to accept the contract.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-MATT-
To lock this in, you only agree to the first pact. And when the first pact is complete, you do not have to trigger any of the other pacts. The contract remains in effect. Should you ever decide to trigger the pact, it immediately comes into play.
-SAM-
So, second pact is: we get a bunch of devils, and they get to install two in a place of divine worship to be determined. Third pact is: we get all sorts of devil magic in exchange for our souls.
-TRAVIS-
I'll do it.
-SAM-
So we're probably not going to do those pacts-- (laughs)
-LAURA-
Just don't do those ones.
-TRAVIS-
Why?
-LIAM-
So, like, we went in to buy a car, and he's also offering us a condo and land in Florida, at the same time, is that about it?
-MATT-
Yeah, you don't have to accept--
-TALIESIN-
In perpetuity, though.
-MATT-
Yeah, in perpetuity. So, you don't have to decide now on the other pacts, but at some point down the road, if you're ever in a situation where you're like, 'oh shit, we're all about to die, I 'invoke the second pact,' boom, you get a bunch of devils to help you for the next month.
-MARISHA-
Wow-- And you just have to, like, say that? You're like, 'Yo, Ipkesh, I take that second pact!'
-MATT-
You invoke the pact.
-TALIESIN-
So the second pact is, we get a bunch of stuff, but we have to do, what was it, the-- "agrees to introduction and installation of at least two of--"
-SAM-
We have to take two devils and put them in a place of holy worship somewhere in the world.
-TRAVIS-
Right.
-TALIESIN-
Okay. And then the third pact is our soul.
-MATT-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Our soul for somebody else's life.
-LIAM-
One of our souls, or all our souls?
-MATT-
One person has to sign the contract and only that person's soul--
-LIAM-
Oh, that's not so bad.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
And the first pact, the scribe "enables safe passage into the depths of Mentiri, specifically the Bastion of Flesh, unharmed." I feel like that's a little thin.
-MATT-
Well, you're-- And you say this, in character? (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
(Percy voice) I feel like-- I feel like the first pact's a little thin.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Well, there is room for negotiation, of course."
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-SAM-
If we have some time, I could summon my father's army of lawyers--
-TALIESIN-
(chuckles) Do they have a branch here?
-SAM-
No, (laughs) it would take them quite some time to arrive. But they've negotiated tougher deals than this.
-TALIESIN-
I was strangely hoping that your father's lawyers had a branch here, that would be--
-LAURA-
Appropriate.
-SAM-
I think they originated here, but then they moved to where I'm from for the tax laws.
-TALIESIN-
I suppose that is a growth industry.
This is interesting, I'm going to think it over.
I'm going to leave it, and we'll be back in the evening.
-MATT-
"Very well. Please, return when you have a better idea of what you would like to see adjusted, and I will do the same."
-TALIESIN-
I thank you for your time and patience.
-MATT-
He takes it and rolls it up, and it vanishes below the table as you exit.
-SAM-
(whispers) How do we know when it's evening here?
-LAURA-
(whispers) Don't whisper here.
-SAM-
Oh. Sorry. (very loudly) How do we know when it's evening here?
-TALIESIN-
Don't yell here!
-LAURA-
I don't know. Can we ask him? How do we know when it's evening here? Does it get dark?
-MATT-
"It does not get dark, there is no evening here in Dis."
-LAURA-
Of course! (nervous laughing) Of course.
-TALIESIN-
We're going to get mugged, aren't we? (laughs)
-MARISHA-
Mm, I mean-- I already got close!
-TALIESIN-
Well, let's take a look around.
-LAURA-
Does he seem to, like, notice or care that we're not the tieflings anymore?
-MATT-
He has taken a scan of the group, but he doesn't seem to be flinching. He is just there and eager to talk some more.
-TRAVIS-
It's Vegas, man. He don't give a fuck.
-TALIESIN-
I think indifference is the common courtesy here to an awful lot.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
So, as you guys exit the establishment into the street, the heated cobblestone still glowing a dull maroon and black, you watch as what looks to be some sort of strange mist-like form emanates from a crack, and turns into a screaming specter that-- (gasping) -- and drifts further down the street, past you.
-LAURA-
Lovely.
-SAM-
They need a tourism board.
(laughter)
Badly.
-MATT-
What do you guys wish to do?
-LAURA-
What are we trying to do?
-SAM-
I don't know!
-LAURA-
We're just going to walk around and see if we can sense where this bastion of death is.
-MATT-
You've got 25 minutes before your spell is up.
-LAURA-
The bastion of death is what we're trying to find.
-MARISHA-
The bastion of death is--
-MATT-
The Bastion of Flesh.
-MARISHA-
The Bastion of Flesh is who he wants us to kill?
-MATT-
No, the Bastion of Flesh is-- The safe passage to the Bastion of Flesh, that is what the contract enables you should you fulfill your part of the deal.
-LAURA-
So that's the prison we're looking for.
-TALIESIN-
The Mentiri is the prison; that's the part of the prison. Prison has parts.
-LIAM-
Tell me-- how much time?
-TALIESIN-
25 minutes.
-LIAM-
25 minutes? What can we do in 25 minutes? We could fast-talk a couple of people.
-LAURA-
Could I Locate Object on the Bastion of Flesh?
-MATT-
Not an object. It's a location.
-TRAVIS-
What about snow cones?
-LAURA-
Just going to keep asking.
-MATT-
(laughs) You wouldn't be Vex if you didn't.
-TALIESIN-
25 minutes until your spell is dissipated, but once it is, we can do Locate Person.
-MARISHA-
Correct. I could also do Find the Path if I have a little piece of the prison. If we could get a little piece of the prison--
-LAURA-
Oh. No problem!
-TRAVIS-
What the fuck?
-MARISHA-
What?
-SAM-
We just need a little chunk of prison lock.
-TRAVIS-
If I just had a little piece of the White House, I could just-- (snaps)-- right to it.
-MARISHA-
Hey, there are people who walk away with pieces of forests, beaches, all the time.
-TRAVIS-
They get there first, though.
-LAURA-
Where do you find those people? Just walking around?
-MARISHA-
I don't know. Does there look like an oddities store?
-LIAM-
Were there any last little bit of Hotis grit or funk in my belly button where he shanked me?
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Yeah.
-MATT-
No, I mean--
-LIAM-
No?
-MATT-
Unless you guys have anything in your possession from that battle, then no.
-SAM-
Vex.
-LAURA-
What?
-SAM-
You had mentioned that you had a Locate Object spell.
-LAURA-
I do.
-SAM-
Is there any object that this person we're supposed to assassinate has that you have seen and know of?
-LAURA-
Oh, this person? No, I don't know anything about--
-SAM-
No no no, I mean the one that we came to the Nine Hells for.
This Hotis.
-LIAM-
Hotis. I mean, he had knives, but that's the only thing I remember.
-TALIESIN-
He had a cloak, did he not?
-MARISHA-
He did have a cloak, but-- I mean, last time we saw him, he was also a-- little, writhing--
-LAURA-
I did see those knives, right?
-MATT-
You did, but also--
-LIAM-
Yeah, I mean he was just a-- Like a cat baby wrapped in bacon when we saw him.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, he had a tiger-skin hoodie.
-MARISHA-
I don't know if he would still have those items.
-MATT-
No, the objects would not reform with him.
He would reform without-- All the material possessions that Hotis had on his body when you killed him were left behind.
-MARISHA-
Does there look like there's a weird oddities store or dealer or--
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-TALIESIN-
I'm also getting in on that. I'm looking for anything of value.
-SAM-
Like a costume shop?
-MARISHA-
Natural 20! Hee hee hee--
-TALIESIN-
Never mind.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-MATT-
All right.
You don't ask around because--
-MARISHA-
That's bad.
-MATT-
It's a bad idea, and you start getting the idea, too, whatever's coming down, they get the stink eye, and you just-- turn tough gaze and keep walking. And eventually, you come upon a facility of some kind that looks to be made of almost-- pieces of black and rusted sheet metal that's jammed together in a very patchwork fashion. You don't see a doorway more than you see a triangular opening where the various interlocking pieces of metal aren't fully flush. From the inside, you see a soft reddish-orange glow that flickers ever so gently. As you glance inside, you see a few makeshift braziers that are flickering with reddish-orange fire and what appear to be some gleaming shelves lining up strange, glowing collections.
-SAM-
Going in?
-TALIESIN-
I want to go in.
-MATT-
Okay, as you guys enter--
-TRAVIS-
Hands in your pockets, Tary.
-SAM-
I have no pockets.
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-TALIESIN-
It's not Tary. We have to give him a name.
-SAM-
Why?
-TALIESIN-
Everyone use code names.
-SAM-
Code names?
-TRAVIS-
Yrat.
-LAURA-
Yrat.
-SAM-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Yrat. It's your name backwards, right?
-SAM-
Oh! Okay.
-LAURA-
Whoa, Grog.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-LAURA-
How?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, it hurts. Ow! (laughter)
Ow, ow.
-MATT-
You take--
-TRAVIS-
Ow.
(laughter)
-MATT-
You take three psychic damage--
-TRAVIS-
(yells)
-MATT-
-- from attempting to think too hard.
-LAURA-
He's writing it down!
-MARISHA-
You just got punished for being too witty!
-MATT-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
It's so sad!
-LAURA-
That's amazing.
-MARISHA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
Just a bit of blood trickles out of his right ear.
-LAURA-
Oh Grog.
-TALIESIN-
That's the most you thing I have seen happen all game.
-MARISHA-
I feel like we have to call you Yrat now.
-TALIESIN-
Yrat.
-SAM-
That's fine, I've been treated worse than this--earlier today.
-LAURA-
Yeah, you got pissed on by a bear.
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was talking about!
-LAURA-
Who by the way-- He's back in my necklace by the way. I don't want Trinket walking around here.
-MATT-
I assumed you didn't want a giant bear walking around.
-TALIESIN-
What are we calling the two of you?
-LIAM-
Wode. You can call me Wode.
-LAURA-
Wode?
-LIAM-
Wode.
-TALIESIN-
That's somehow worse, all right.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-LAURA-
I guess I'm Wade
-MARISHA-
I'm never going to-- Wode and Wade?
-LIAM-
Wode and Wade!
-MARISHA-
What the shit?
-TALIESIN-
What? No Bill and Ted? All right. Wode and Wade. My word!
-MARISHA-
Wode, and Wade, Yrat--
-TALIESIN-
Freddie.
-MARISHA-
And you can call me Minxie.
-TALIESIN-
Minxie.
-SAM-
Okay.
-LAURA-
And this is Greg over here.
-MARISHA-
Greg.
-SAM-
By the way, our 25 minutes is quickly ticking down.
-MARISHA-
Well, imagine this is happening quickly, right?
-TALIESIN-
This is happening quickly as we enter the shop. We all enter the shop.
-MATT-
Well, it's taken a while to find this place so you're about ten minutes before your spell ends. This is a very big city, you guys. So as you walk-- This is the only thing you've seen so far that looks to have any sort of, loosely welcoming or not, heavily guarded 'don't come in or you'll get killed'-type exterior. And as you enter the low-lit inside, you see these rickety-looking shelves that contain small glowing gems or crystals of different colors and sizes. Like weird geodes that are cut from natural deposits.
And across the way, there is just a stool and what looks to be some sort of humanoid creature that is slumped forward and breathing heavily. With these elongated, dull green color on the skin, a series of small spines that protrude from the shoulders and back--
-SAM-
Spines?
-MATT-
Yeah, like jagged, long, thin spines. And as you enter inside, it turns up and goes,
-SAM-
Wait!
-MATT-
"Yes?"
-SAM-
We don't have a code name for him!
-LAURA-
Yeah, Freddie.
-SAM-
Oh, Freddie, okay.
-TRAVIS-
Bidet.
-MATT-
"You come to buy pretties?"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yes!
-SAM-
No! What?
-MARISHA-
Thing is-- I'm looking for something specific.
-MATT-
What do you seek?
-MARISHA-
Do you have any pieces or remnants or items from the Mentiri Prison? Specifically from the Bastion of Flesh?
-MATT-
"No, no, I do not go there."
-MARISHA-
Why not?
-MATT-
"Because it is for fleshy types." And he nudges this long, jagged chin; these gnashing teeth that are crooked and overlapping as it spits as it speaks in your direction.
-TALIESIN-
Charming.
-MARISHA-
Where is it located? We need in.
-MATT-
"What?"
-MARISHA-
And then I slowly start to Shapechange just for the erinyes face, and I give just a flash of it. We need in. And you're going to help me, aren't you?
-MATT-
Make an intimidation check with advantage.
-MARISHA-
Fucking hell.
-MATT-
Literally.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
Fucking hell.
-LAURA-
What is it? What is it?
-MARISHA-
It's a 19! But it was almost bad!
-LAURA-
Plus seven.
-MARISHA-
Plus seven, so 26.
-MATT-
"I do not know the-- the nature of this city is to be rebuilt. Always rebuilt, aways changing.
The archdevil, he worries. He's paranoid.
Everything must not be the same as it was. I know not where it is, I know not where the Bastion is, I'm sorry!"
-MARISHA-
Well then, how do people get around the city? You know.
-MATT-
"Those who work, those who are within, those who are under the guidance of the prison's masters. They know. They know."
-MARISHA-
Where do I find them?
-LAURA-
(whispers) The ring!
-MARISHA-
And I show them the ring of Asmodeus.
-SAM-
You don't have it.
-LAURA-
(whispers) No, but she does.
-SAM-
Oh. But she doesn't?
-TRAVIS-
I do.
-MARISHA-
He has it.
-LAURA-
Oh. I dunno who has it. The ring!
-MATT-
It's on his pinkie.
-SAM-
He went to Jared!
-MARISHA-
(high-pitched singing) It can only be Jared!
-TALIESIN-
Jared!
-MATT-
"I can not help! I don't know." And he just lowers his head in a shameful worrying. You can see his knees are quivering ever-so-gently.
-LAURA-
I want to insight check him to see if he looks like he's--
-MATT-
Make an insight check.
-LAURA-
I feel like he is but I just want to make sure.
-TRAVIS-
That's good.
-LAURA-
26 there.
-MATT-
Okay, legitimately, this creature is pretty pathetic as far as devils go that you've come across, and in the threatening presence of an erinyes that is asking for information it does not seem to have, it is legitimately awaiting a terrible demotion that it doesn't feel it earned.
-LAURA-
Mistress, I don't believe he knows.
-MARISHA-
I need a name and location of where to find the information that I need.
-MATT-
"I don't know, I don't know."
-MARISHA-
Then who does?
-MATT-
You see him looking around, spastically, his eyes are shooting around the room at all of you and around looking at the geodes at different directions almost like a weird iguana face. He says, "The torturers, the chains."
-LAURA-
Oh shit.
-MARISHA-
God damn it-- the chain devils. All right.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, we're in here.
-TALIESIN-
I think we should allow this poor creature an attempt to redeem himself, what is it that you sell here that would please our mistress?
-MATT-
"I sell pretties, I sell pretties, pretties used for rites, used for magic"
-TALIESIN-
Please, impress us.
-MATT-
He stands up now, and this creature that looked so pathetic when it was squatting down on this stool, these long thin gollum-like legs, it stands up and is now head-height, a good foot over most of the party-- Gangly, the spines extending from the back of the head and the arms and the elbows as it stands up now. As it slowly stalks over to one of the shelves and pulls off one of these strange purple geodes, the various crystals jutting out of different sides, and it turns around and brings it forward. "This, this carries pure condensed soul energy, geodes robbed her from the fourth layer." As he takes it and holds it in front towards you, you look inside and you swear within the slight glimmers of light that shake through from the nearby braziers you see almost dozens of faces pressed up against the crystalline interior, shifting past, similar to that giant sphere, that orb you saw being passed through the city when you first arrived.
-LIAM-
This is insulting! Skip the small stuff, what have you got?
-MATT-
"This is what I have got."
-LIAM-
That's it?
-MATT-
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." He looks to you and looks back. "Mistress, I'm, I have-- this."
-SAM-
Mistress, would you like one?
-TALIESIN-
What do you have that's unique? Expensive is lovely, don't get us wrong, but we're looking for unique, odd.
-MARISHA-
Yes, I had one of those for breakfast.
-TALIESIN-
So proud of you right now.
-MATT-
It lumbers over to this far corner and there's a pile of what looks like burlap and refuse and partially eaten partially rotting away chunks of flesh, and just rummaging through them, looking over the shoulder with a scattered look, and pulls up what looks to be a long-decomposed and somewhat mummified humanoid arm. The fingers are kind of locked up in this way, and there's a small brass bracelet around the center of the wrist.
-LIAM-
Now you have our attention.
-MATT-
He shakes it and you hear it rattling.
-LIAM-
What can you tell us about that?
-MATT-
You can hear it rattling against the bones and as it shakes, one of the fingers snaps off with a poof of dust and hits the ground, "Oh! Sorry." He picks it up and tries to put it back on but it won't go back on.
(sounds of disgust)
-MARISHA-
I snatch it from him. Yrat, do the thing.
-SAM-
I ritually cast Identify on the bracelet.
-MATT-
Okay. The bracelet essentially acts as a divination beacon. It's attuned to a secondary device that can keep watch on this one. Apparently whoever previously wore this was doing so under the intent of relaying their travel or experience to somewhere else, and then met a very terrible end.
-SAM-
Oh, so it's useless to us.
-MATT-
Maybe. Not everything you encounter is going to be useful, guys!
-SAM-
Yeah no, that's fine, that's fine.
-MARISHA-
Well, it's to relay information back to whoever's wearing it? Or to him specifically?
-MATT-
To whoever has the other object that's paired with this that you don't know what that is.
-TALIESIN-
We found a single walkie-talkie.
-LAURA-
Right, yeah.
-MATT-
Essentially.
-LIAM-
Tary, is that thing working right now?
-TALIESIN-
Is it working right now?
-SAM-
I -- Detect Magic on it? Is it--
-MATT-
It is magical, it is functional.
-SAM-
As far as I know, someone is watching this right now.
-MATT-
You don't know how old it is or how long it's been there, but it is magical.
-SAM-
Mistress, would you like this?
-MARISHA-
We'll take it for good measure.
-SAM-
Oh, really.
-MARISHA-
I guess?
-SAM-
Okay, sure.
How much would you like for this? What do they--
-MARISHA-
I just want this as a souvenir for our visit.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I just want the one walkie talkie that doesn't have a pair.
-MARISHA-
I'm not going to pay for it. You're not going to sell this; I want it. Right?
-MATT-
You can see the brow furrow, and there's a moment of instinctual anger and frustration, like a kid who had his lunch money taken, but he's still like (angry breathing), goes and sits down on the stool once more, the long knobby knees almost jesting up to shoulder height as it sits, its arms draped over the front, and the fingers dragging across the ground in front as it does, as it looks up, "Take it."
-MARISHA-
I lean forward and I take my erinyes nail and I go around his face, and I say, consider this a good-faith investment.
-MATT-
"Yes, yes."
-MARISHA-
You will be seeing us again. And I take out 20 gold. 20 gold.
-MATT-
He takes it and goes: "I will be a favor to the mistress."
-TALIESIN-
We hear you utter our description to anyone, and you will never see anything again.
-MATT-
"No, no, no."
-TRAVIS-
Don't we want the purple gobstopper?
-TRAVIS-
Why?
-TALIESIN-
We've got plenty.
-TRAVIS-
That's coin around here, though. We might need it.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
His hands clasp together, overlapping in front of him. He's looking up at you with this new grin, almost like, now there's been a moment of acceptance or a moment of some sort of, in his eyes, a union.
-MARISHA-
If you minions would like to buy the purple stone with your allowance--
-TRAVIS-
Oh, motherfucker.
-MARISHA-
-- the mistress grants you, you may.
-TRAVIS-
How much for the pretty?
-LAURA-
Thanks so much, mistress.
-TALIESIN-
Perhaps you would like to shift back to your normal form.
-MARISHA-
You're welcome, young Wade.
-MATT-
The creature's looking very confused, but nevertheless eager to listen.
"For the purple stone --"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
"1500 gold pieces."
-TALIESIN-
That number does not please the mistress, I don't think. Does it?
-SAM-
Here you go. 1500 gold.
-MATT-
As you throw the sack there is a--
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-MATT-
(grunts) And sets it down next to it, stands up, grabs and takes the geode off the shelf and hands it to you.
-SAM-
Thank you.
-MATT-
"Mistress is pleased, yes?"
-MARISHA-
Very. Keep it that way.
-MATT-
"Yes."
-MARISHA-
All right. Roll out.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Autobots--
-ALL-
Roll out.
-MARISHA-
It was taking everything to not say "Autobots!"
-MATT-
All right. As you guys step out of the facility into the center of town, you sense the final moments of your Shapechange spell--
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
-- beginning to dissipate.
-MARISHA-
And I kind of want to--
-LIAM-
Okay, before we leave, I want to hang back just for a sec, and, hey, Slenderman. You seem a nervous type. You keep to yourself, do you?
-MATT-
"Maybe."
-LIAM-
Where would you not go, to stay out from under the noses of your betters?
-MATT-
"I don't understand."
-LIAM-
You hide in your shop. Where do you avoid so you don't get stepped on?
-MATT-
He leans out of the door with you and points towards the iron tower.
-LIAM-
Thanks.
-MATT-
As you're about to leave, he grabs the back of your cloak and pulls you in, points past your shoulders, his long jagged curved claw, and you notice as two more of these flying entities that scoot by, one of them perching on a building across the way, wearing the golden armor, stop and, "The Whisperers." And then pushes you back out of the street and you hear the shifting of metal behind you, as a large slab is shifted to close the front of the shop.
-MARISHA-
I use Alter Self to go to my tiefling form.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
I want to keep an eye out for all of those imps in gold.
-MATT-
Okay. Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
Same.
-LAURA-
24.
-MATT-
24, Okay--
-LIAM-
30.
-LAURA-
Whoa.
-MATT-
Okay! Between the two of you, looking up, there are-- at the peripheral of your vision and the bits of the green ash clouds that make up the sky as the occasional flashes of lightning streak through it from within, you see the shadows of hundreds of flying entities that seem to be just running paths, keeping watch, many just stop and perch for a moment, glancing over the street, and then take off again. Many of them wearing the same gold armor, these Whisperers appear to be everywhere and watching everyone. There is --
-LAURA-
But they're not paying us special attention at all.
-MATT-
There are a handful that seem to be genuinely interested in keeping an eye on you, but you also see other ones that are genuinely keeping an eye on anyone else wandering the street.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
So the man on top has cast a wide net over this city?
-MATT-
It seems that way, yes.
-LIAM-
There's no way we're unseen. Yeah.
-MARISHA-
As we start-- are we walking back towards the tavern? As we walk, I--
-TALIESIN-
Take a slightly different route back, just to try and see more.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
So it seems one of the lesser devils who is interested in Vax might be our ticket in.
-LAURA-
The chain guys.
-MARISHA-
The chain guys.
-TALIESIN-
Can you scry him, since you've seen him before?
-LIAM-
That's a good idea.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I guess I could.
-TALIESIN-
Let's scry ourselves a chain devil.
-MARISHA-
I'm wondering if worst-case scenario we could always use you as bait, Vax?
-LAURA-
Wode.
-MARISHA-
Sorry, Wode.
-TALIESIN-
Wode.
-LIAM-
Thanks, Wade.
-TALIESIN-
It's cool, brah.
-MARISHA-
Party on, Wode.
-TALIESIN-
Party on, Wade. Let's scry!
-MARISHA-
We get back. Okay, we gotta get back to the tavern. Back to the tavern?
-MATT-
Yeah, it's a ritual, you'd have to set up for it.
All right. So you head back, and you're scrying on the chain devil you saw before? Okay.
-GROG-
Any chance he'll see you do it then?
-LAURA-
I know, is he going to know?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, who cares.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, now we're carefree! Oh good, I love it!
-MARISHA-
Well, to be fair, I feel like these people are used to being watched.
-LAURA-
That's true.
-MATT-
All right, what's your spell DC?
-MARISHA-
20.
-MATT-
All righty. Actually, it pulls from here-- it's going to be a wisdom save-- hmm, okay. Hmm.
You finish the ritual, and as you focus, there's a flash of red-hot energy in your eyes, and then the spell comes to an end.
-LAURA-
Is he like Hotis?
-LIAM-
Did you zero in?
-MARISHA-
I hate it when that happens! It's like a flashbulb going off in your eye!
-LAURA-
Could you do it at a higher level?
-MARISHA-
Ugh, bastards! Oh, Christ! I can't, that's it, that's all I got for the day.
That's it.
-TRAVIS-
So, nothing?
-MARISHA-
I got 4th-level spells and lower.
-LAURA-
Balls.
-TALIESIN-
What is the Vassalage? That is a good question. Shit.
-LAURA-
Welp.
-TRAVIS-
Are they up in-- We went up to the room, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Does anybody want to try the meat stuff downstairs?
-LAURA-
No!
-TALIESIN-
No.
-TRAVIS-
Why?
-LAURA-
I feel like it's human remains, I don't know.
-TRAVIS-
But you don't know.
-LAURA-
It doesn't look appealing to me, Grog.
-TALIESIN-
I have a very active imagination when I eat.
-TRAVIS-
I don't. I'll be right back. I go downstairs.
-MATT-
Okay. You head downstairs--
-LIAM-
I'm going to accompany Grog, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay. As the two of you head down, you can see-- There's that one central table to the left western side of the room that has almost like a trough look to it, with the jagged edges?
-TRAVIS-
Yup.
-MATT-
Currently has four imps that are perched on the edge that are just tearing into bits, tearing it off and chewing and they all stop and look up at you, all four at once, as you walk down and they all just slowly chew as you approach and walk into the chamber.
-TRAVIS-
Are they wearing armor and shit?
-MATT-
No.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, good.
-MATT-
They are not wearing armor. Ipkesh is present, but not at the same table he was earlier.
He's currently at the bar area talking with his rotund barkeep.
-TRAVIS-
Hey, that stuff, right, that normal people have. Can I have like, a little plate of it?
-MATT-
The thick, greasy guy sits, goes, "Oh, yeah." He looks over to Ipkesh-- Winks at you.
"On the house."
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's very kind of you. See? Look, experimenting with new cultures is really quite nice. New tastes and all. What does it look like?
-MATT-
It looks like-- You know steak tartare where it has that purplish-red color to it?
-TRAVIS-
Very red.
-MATT-
Imagine that, but there's a series of jagged bone shards sticking out at sections of it, like whatever it was carved off of had been pulverized before it was butchered.
-TRAVIS-
Mm. Tenderized.
-MATT-
Yes. But with the bone still present within.
And it is seeping this sludge-like, bloody fluid that is just pooled around it on this iron platter.
-TRAVIS-
Wode, would you want any of this?
-LIAM-
"You know, I'm going to watch-- You go first." And I put my hand on his arm and say, "Let's just see how you do." And I don't take my hand off.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. I'll take one of the little bones out, and I spoon together like, a good chunk like spaghetti on a fork. And I pop it right in.
-MATT-
Okay. Well, there are no utensils.
-TRAVIS-
No, no, I'm using the bone as the utensil.
-MATT-
Using the bone as the utensil, okay. As you spool it up, pop it in and chew, it's-- it's very gamey. It's warm. But the flavor, it's-- it's very iron-like.
-TRAVIS-
Like chewing on pennies.
-MATT-
Kind of, yeah, and a similar texture. The bones do tear into parts of your upper lip.
-TRAVIS-
Ah.
-MATT-
It hurts.
-TRAVIS-
Ah.
-MATT-
I'd say, in the process of devouring this one bite, you do suffer-- You suffer two points of piercing damage.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking hell.
-LAURA-
Little by little, Grog.
-MARISHA-
It's the little things.
-MATT-
As you're chewing-- Vax, you watch Grog squinting his eyes a bit and chewing as bits of blood begin to dribble down the sides of his chin, but a bright red color, not the color of the meat that he's eating.
-LIAM-
Hey.
-TRAVIS-
Do I feel high? Like Freddie did when he consumed the little orb of-- ?
-MATT-
No, you do not. You chew it, you swallow it, it hurts and grinds its way down, hits your stomach. There is a slight numbness to the inside as you eat it.
-TRAVIS-
Hey!
-MATT-
But that's the most you get.
-LIAM-
You all right? You feeling all right?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it really fights back as you eat it.
You know?
-LIAM-
What's the aftertaste like?
-TRAVIS-
It kind of tastes like if you took a bunch of rusty nails and then shoved them in your thumb and then sucked on that for a while.
-LIAM-
Huh.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
That was-- very specific.
-TRAVIS-
Have you done that before?
-MARISHA-
No, but I feel like you have.
-TRAVIS-
Have you not?
-MARISHA-
Don't worry about it.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. Yeah. I have another bite.
-MATT-
All right. You, bite by bite, begin to finish the meal. I'd say, for the remainder of it, you suffer another three points of piercing damage, but you do finish the flesh in front of you.
-TRAVIS-
My plate of flesh.
-LIAM-
He legitimately seems fine? He's all right, he's not like-- veins aren't popping out, nothing amiss?
-MATT-
Nope.
-LIAM-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
My compliments to the chef.
-MATT-
His already somewhat greasy, ruddy cheeks go to a blushing smile. "Thank you."
-TRAVIS-
That tasted like forearm. Okay, I'm good.
Wode, do you want to go back up-- (hiccups) -- stairs?
-LIAM-
"Yeah." I grab a small, just a small piece and put it in my mouth, and I spit it out immediately.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Immediately.
-MATT-
It's pretty awful.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Is it salty?
-TRAVIS-
It's not for everyone, yeah. Cook is right there, literally. Sorry.
-LIAM-
Hah, yeah. Let's go back up.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right. You guys head back up. So what's everyone doing?
-LAURA-
Jeez. Well, I feel like we're not getting very far in the city.
-LIAM-
Yeah, we're kind of eatin' it in here.
-TALIESIN-
I say we take the contract.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah! Yeah!
-SAM-
I hate to say, "I told you so--"
-TALIESIN-
I'll take the contract.
-SAM-
No.
-MARISHA-
What? Percy--
-LAURA-
Percy, you're not taking this contract.
-TALIESIN-
I'm the one who's already touched by demonic forces. I think I can resist the temptations of the second and third pact.
-TRAVIS-
Cool.
-TALIESIN-
And I think I know what to add to this.
I think we need to demand a guide, and I think we need to demand safe passage out of the prison, as well, and back to our original plane as best he can.
-TRAVIS-
Yep, that sounds right.
-SAM-
I must request that I sign the contract. I can't let you do this, Percy.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
(laughter)
Seems fair.
-TRAVIS-
Yrat, that is most noble of you. You truly are earning your place here.
-LAURA-
Tary, that's so kind! Are you sure you want to?
-SAM-
Unless, of course, you want to--
-TRAVIS-
Yrat, you will be a hero to many.
-MARISHA-
Such a hero!
-LAURA-
I mean, I've never met a hero braver than you.
-TRAVIS-
Give him a pen.
-SAM-
I--.
-TALIESIN-
We don't actually have it with us, we'd have to go downstairs.
-LAURA-
Oh. Right.
-TALIESIN-
But I will-- Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I also think, Freddie, that you're more capable of resisting temptation, as you say.
Sorry, Yrat.
-TALIESIN-
I'll say-- I feel my weaknesses in my heart, and I know where they lie, and I definitely know they exist. And I-- Nothing in this agreement tempts me. I have temptations, but they are not in this contract.
-LIAM-
And besides, you have us around you, friend.
-MARISHA-
Is it only because you've experienced these types of temptations before?
-TALIESIN-
I think so. And I'm already-- I don't know what's going to happen to me when I die.
-SAM-
Wait, so you're signing it, now? I thought I was signing it.
-TALIESIN-
We were messing with you--
-SAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
-- but if you feel the urge to actually take it upon yourself--
-SAM-
Well, I do think it might actually help me in my future-- Part of it could actually help me.
-TALIESIN-
How so?
-LAURA-
So, you would actually sell your soul?
-SAM-
No, not that part. But I could use a cadre of devils at some point.
-LAURA-
Then your soul would be forfeit!
-SAM-
No-- no.
-TALIESIN-
No, actually, not on that one.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Not that one! Not that part.
That's pact two.
-MARISHA-
No, we'd just have to release a couple of devils into the material plane.
-LAURA-
How about no on that?
-MARISHA-
Yes, I agree.
-TRAVIS-
Holy shit.
-LAURA-
Because then we'd have to fight them.
-TRAVIS-
Can we please go sign this contract?
-LAURA-
I mean, we could. Where in the contract does it say we can't kill them as soon as we release them?
-SAM-
Nowhere.
-LIAM-
I mean, Yrat, we're still easing you in.
Freddie has a little more experience than you, and I think that we can put our faith in that.
-TALIESIN-
I'm not going to say that I'm never going to do anything stupid again, and I certainly wouldn't necessarily want you to stop me if I were, but I'm not going to do this sort of stupid, am I?
-MARISHA-
Percy, if you die, though, doesn't this mean that you forfeit your soul here--?
-TALIESIN-
I'm pretty sure it doesn't. If I die before it's finished--
-MATT-
No, no. If you complete the third pact--
-TALIESIN-
Then yes.
-MATT-
You still live, but then when you die your soul is forfeit.
-TALIESIN-
But if I don't complete the third pact, or if we don't activate the second or the third pact, then I'm fine--
-MATT-
Correct.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, then there's no problem whatsoever.
-MATT-
And if by any means, at any point you break the contract--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, yeah, if we do not kill who we're supposed to kill, or if it leads back to him, then I'm--
-LAURA-
So, if you die in the process--
-MARISHA-
You're fine?
-LAURA-
No, then your soul goes here--
-TALIESIN-
To be fair, we're already here!
-MARISHA-
That was my question. Yes, but we came here willingly--
-LAURA-
But you could become one of those melty guys!
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
You know, it's entirely possible that there'll be several creatures fighting over my body when I die, and my soul when I die, already.
-LAURA-
I'll be one of them.
-TALIESIN-
Bless you. But no, seriously. I don't know what any of this means.
-MARISHA-
Percy, we've come here to try and kill a kitten, and it's already been a massive pain in our ass. We really don't want to come back to try and save your soul.
-TALIESIN-
Well, you'll already be here.
-LAURA-
So? Don't die.
-TALIESIN-
So we won't die.
-TRAVIS-
Hey, cool! Can we--
-TALIESIN-
And actually, it's not that clear what would happen if I died without completing the contract. I might just get brought back.
-MATT-
This would be a conversation to have with the scribe.
-TALIESIN-
So yep, I'm going to go down. I'm going to sign it.
-LAURA-
I'm going to go down with you.
-MARISHA-
Talk about-- talk about the revisions first! Always get those revisions first.
-TALIESIN-
We're doing it.
-MARISHA-
And a new print-up.
-LIAM-
With a red pen.
-MATT-
All right. So, all of you head down into the main chamber of the tavern, and there, returning to the table where he once sat, you see Ipkesh. No wine glass, but the paper folded out in front, waiting patiently with his hands folded in the front.
-TALIESIN-
Some quick questions--
-MATT-
"Yes, please."
-TALIESIN-
I need a guide. Someone who, while is not connected to you, can help us find our way through the city. Find what we need. Answer questions. Somebody with a little bit of the lay of the land. Somebody to help. Not with the actual act, obviously, but just to run us around? What happens to our soul-- what happens to my soul if I die in the process of this?
-MATT-
"If the rest of your friends complete the contract, your soul is fine."
-TALIESIN-
And if we don't complete the contract, then--
-MATT-
"If you don't complete the contract, you are in breach."
-TALIESIN-
Are they in breach, or just me?
-MATT-
"Just you."
-TALIESIN-
Perfect. Safe passage into the Bastion of Flesh. Once we're there, we're on our own?
-MATT-
"Once you are there, you are on your own.
However, I can ensure that you are brought there unharmed."
-TALIESIN-
With access to our foe?
-MATT-
"I can imagine that can be arranged."
-TALIESIN-
Can it be arranged in writing?
-MATT-
"To the extent of my capabilities, yes. Just as you have limitations, as do I."
-TALIESIN-
I would be very pleased if we could complete this contract, if this contract becomes null and void, not with us getting to the Bastion of Flesh, but with our return to our plane, with our enemy harmed. We get what we want, you get what you want. Not we get towards what we want, you get what you want.
-MATT-
"But where in this is it fair for me to suffer for your stupidity?"
-TALIESIN-
That is a question for the ages, isn't it? (laughter)
-MARISHA-
That we need on a t-shirt!
-SAM-
We can at least contain in the contract, once our foe is dispatched, that you will help us arrange safe passage out of here.
-TALIESIN-
You'll help us arrange our own passage-- We have a way out of this material plane, we just need to make sure that we're-- Is there anything in the prison that would not allow us to leave under our own power?
-MATT-
"Not to my knowledge, no. Those chambers specifically reside within the Iron Tower. That's where they imprison the extremely dangerous ones.
The Bastion of Flesh is where they keep all the living mortals that were captured on this plane and not yet fully corrupt."
-TALIESIN-
Do they take our possessions before we go in there?
-MATT-
"They would. However, if you so wish, I can arrange to have them maintained in your presence."
-MARISHA-
That would be nice.
-TALIESIN-
That would be-- quite pleasing.
-MATT-
As you do that, he grabs the paper and pulls it over, and just takes his finger and writes it across, and as he does it amends the words in the contract in front of you to include the guide to lead you to where you're going, as well as allowing your equipment to also-- unharmed and unspoiled, and within your grasp.
-TALIESIN-
That will do. You do not have knowledge of whether or not our magics will work in that prison?
-MATT-
"I do not."
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-LAURA-
Can I insight check him?
-MATT-
You may.
-LAURA-
24?
-MATT-
Okay. He seems honest. You get the sense here: he doesn't gain anything if you all fail. If you complete both sides of the contract and then he dies, he gets nothing.
-LAURA-
Right.
-MATT-
So-- (weird Skype noises)
If you were to escape--
-LAURA-
What was that?
-MATT-
If-- I dunno.
-LAURA-
It was like an old woman was trying to talk to us!
-MATT-
But yes. So, you get the sense that the purpose of this contract is in hopes of eventual corruption.
-TALIESIN-
That seems fair. I suppose the last question-- And this is just my last addendment, is that we own an artifact of this plane. We would like it if possible to be identified, and for you not to speak to anyone of what we have or what it's worthwhile, and to keep our presence-- confidential, as much as we keep yours confidential. Mutual confidentiality.
-MATT-
"I have nothing to gain by revealing your presence."
-SAM-
Is there any way in this contract we could add a clause where you preorder a thousand or so books to be sold by you here, later?
-MATT-
"I can write up a different contract for you, if you like."
-SAM-
No, well, we can omit that part, that's okay.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I want to-- Can I show him the ring?
-TRAVIS-
What?
-TALIESIN-
Grog, would you--
-SAM-
Greg.
-TALIESIN-
Greg, could you please show him-- I have to sign it with my own name, I imagine, anyway-- Can you show him the--
-TRAVIS-
What you got?
-SAM-
Jared.
-TALIESIN-
Your piece.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MATT-
He kind of leans in and squints. "Hm. It is a signet of the cult of Asmodeus. It is a trifle here, but is used on your plane to assert belonging."
-TALIESIN-
Fair.
-LAURA-
Mmm. Okay.
-SAM-
Are you sure you want to do this?
-TALIESIN-
Last question. The final question.
-MATT-
"Yes?"
-TALIESIN-
How powerful is the Herald of Vassalage?
-MATT-
"The Herald is quite powerful. The Herald resides within his stronghold--"
-TALIESIN-
We would have to get into his stronghold?
-MATT-
"You would."
-LAURA-
How many enemies are we talking about fighting, as well as him?
-MATT-
"General, guarding throughout the stronghold, I'd put it at about a dozen, maybe."
-LAURA-
And what sort of forces does he have?
-MATT-
"Those are his forces locally. He has guards throughout the city, but they're scattered. Thus, the importance of this is to go in unseen and unheard. And if you run into resistance, squash it before it can make any noise."
-LAURA-
What kind of devils are we talking about?
-MATT-
"Nothing too serious. The bearded variety.
Maybe a bone devil, maybe two, I don't know."
-TALIESIN-
And this creature itself? A horn devil?
-MATT-
"Oh, this is a pit fiend."
-MARISHA-
Oh, again? Jesus, fuck--
-SAM-
We've fought-- Oh, you've fought those before.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
What is this 'we'?
-SAM-
Well, we're a team now.
-MATT-
"But Utugash is strong but slow. Slovenly, sluggish. Has reveled in his own opulence for far too long."
-TALIESIN-
What's another dead pit fiend in hell?
-SAM-
I'll sign it.
-MARISHA-
Ask about the Bastion of Flesh--
-TRAVIS-
Do it. Do it now, do it quickly.
-MARISHA-
Ask about the Bastion of Flesh.
-LIAM-
Fred, get that, sign it.
-TALIESIN-
What about the Bastion of Flesh?
-MARISHA-
Well, how big is this prison--
-SAM-
Maybe I should sign this, I don't want you to corrupt yourself senselessly.
-TRAVIS-
Arm wrestle.
-LIAM-
I push Yrat back, away from Freddie.
-SAM-
Ah! (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LIAM-
You're here, enjoy the ride. Freddie has this, thank you.
-TALIESIN-
I'm signing.
-LAURA-
Oh my lord.
-TALIESIN-
I check to see his name, is it his real name that is signed?
-MATT-
I mean, it seems to be the contract wouldn't be binding on his end if it wasn't.
-TALIESIN-
Mm, all right. Not the full name, but enough.
-MARISHA-
Not the full name?
-LAURA-
No.
-SAM-
PDR.
-TRAVIS-
D. Rolo.
-SAM-
(high-pitched) D-Roll!
-LAURA-
Musel.
-MATT-
You don't have to write the entire name.
-MARISHA-
(laughs) Musel
-TALIESIN-
Oh no, wait, it's happen-- No, I'm not doing that.
-MATT-
(laughs) We'll say you do, in character.
-TALIESIN-
No, I've actually finished it.
-MATT-
Okay. As you finish signing, the ink kind of flashes and glows and it burns into the parchment ever so slightly, to the point where you smell the scent of just slightly singed parchment. It curls up away from you and into his grasp as he takes it.
-TALIESIN-
What's a devil to a man who fears no god?
-MATT-
"Hm. Pleasure doing business. Now." And he snaps his fingers, and you watch, kind of apparate on one shoulder, one of the imps that you saw earlier--
-LAURA-
(gasps) Oh, those little guys!
-MATT-
-- when you arrived, that kind of saw you and rushed out when you were coming downstairs. It appears on his shoulder. "This is Vasa. He will be your guide."
-ALL-
Vasa.
-SAM-
With an r, or with an h?
-LAURA-
Well, that sounds familiar.
-MATT-
Vasa. V-A-S-A.
-LAURA-
Of course our father would be named after a fucking imp.
-MATT-
Vessar is your last name. Vasa is different.
-LAURA-
Sounds close e-fucking-nough.
-TALIESIN-
Whitney warned me it would come to this.
-MARISHA-
Who? What?
-TALIESIN-
It's my sister, you never met her.
-MATT-
"Vasa will guide you. Thankfully, the stronghold is near the torture pits, so there is general din and sound and agony to surround. So that might offer you some solace in being unheard.
But be careful."
-TALIESIN-
Any advice would be welcome. We want what you want.
-MATT-
"I know. Rest. Prepare. Enter where is easiest, always the path of least resistance. Get the jump, surprise and silence. When it's time to leave, I can help you travel mostly unseen, should you avoid some of the more piercing eyes of this domain."
-TALIESIN-
Would you know where to get a Silence spell, out of curiosity?
-MATT-
"I can provide maybe one or two."
-TALIESIN-
One would be-- two would be even more helpful.
-MATT-
"Very well. Rest. I'll be here waiting."
-LAURA-
If no one sees us kill him, how will we be arrested?
-MATT-
"Don't worry, I'll know when he's down as I'm sending Vasa along with you."
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
"And once this is known, just wait. Because the alarm will call the guard, specifically the ones that work for me."
-LAURA-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
-LAURA-
So, we should make sure after we kill this big guy not to kill anyone else that comes for us?
-MATT-
"No one that seem to be under his employ, no. Otherwise, clear them out."
-LAURA-
Okay. Perfectly simple.
-SAM-
Let's go plan our attack.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right. As you guys make your way back to your room to discuss, we're going to take a break.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-MATT-
We'll be back here in just a few moments. We have our tiger maple dice tower giveaway at the break from our friends at--
-MARISHA-
Ooh, tiger maple!
-MATT-
Oh my god, it's all in pieces still, oh god! But yeah, it's all magnetically put together.
-LAURA-
Wait, what?
-TALIESIN-
Make-- make the-- the weird little magnet things happen.
-MATT-
I know, you can make it--
-LAURA-
Oh wait, it's a dice tower?
-MARISHA-
It's a dice tower where you make the magnets happen
-MATT-
That all magnetizes together. It's pretty rad. So, yeah.
Do we have a code word for the chat?
-CREW-
You pick.
-MATT-
I pick? The code word will be 'pact'.
P-A-C-T.
-LAURA-
Ooh.
-MATT-
So go ahead and come over to the Twitch chat room, use the word 'pact' in there to join the chance giveaway.
-TALIESIN-
And take the survey if you have a moment!
-MATT-
Exactly!
-MARISHA-
Go take that survey!
-MATT-
Awesome! See you guys in a few minutes.
-TRAVIS-
Pact! [break]
-MATT-
Hello guys, and welcome back! All right! So, before we get in, real fast, we have the winner in chat, the winner of the dice box is iccara! Iccara, congratulations! (cheering)
And well won! There you go. Get that info for you and get that sent out to you ASAP, so congratulations. Also, I forgot to mention because I didn't put it on the thing before, but I'm also, I'll put it on Twitter, I'm going to be guesting at Sakura Con, middle of April, April 14th to the 16th up in Seattle. So if you guys are up there in that area come say hi.
-MARISHA-
Easter weekend!
-MATT-
Yeah. Panels and signings and all that fun stuff. So folks near and around the Seattle area, come up to Sakura Con and say hi.
-MARISHA-
I'm going camping.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Really?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
That's exciting.
-TALIESIN-
Oh man.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, it's going to be so good.
-MATT-
Okay. Bringing it back in. So you guys have signed a contract. What do you to prep? What are you doing now?
-SAM-
Going to sleep.
-LAURA-
Wait, we need to prep anything?
-MATT-
You're locked in.
-TRAVIS-
Only one of us is locked in.
-LAURA-
Well, what's our plan? We go in, we fucking try to stealth as much as fucking possible and kill a fucking pit fiend.
-MARISHA-
Stealth in, kill a pit fiend. Done it before, we can do it again. Okay, I'm confident about this plan.
-LAURA-
How did we do it-- Wait, wait, wait. Let's just remember, how did we do it last time?
-MARISHA-
How did we do it last time?
-TRAVIS-
We bumblefucked our way into it, got super super lucky--
-MARISHA-
And bumblefucked our way out of it.
-LAURA-
Was he weak to anything that we remember?
-TRAVIS-
No.
-MATT-
Nope.
-LAURA-
Nothing?
-LIAM-
But he was extremely frightening.
-TRAVIS-
And smart. Very smart.
-LAURA-
Oh, so definitely do a Feast?
-MATT-
And poison.
-MARISHA-
I can do-- Nope, nope, I can't.
-MATT-
You guys technically are still under the effects of a Feast.
-LAURA-
Yeah, but we won't be when we go to fight him.
-MATT-
Depends on how soon you get there.
-LAURA-
No, but--
-SAM-
We're sleeping.
-MATT-
The Feast lasts for 24 hours.
-LAURA-
So if we rest--
-MATT-
It's been probably, if you start resting fairly soon, it will have been maybe four to five hours after you used this-- or ate the Feast. With the eight hours' full rest, you're still looking at almost half a day left. It's up to you.
-SAM-
Oh, all right.
-MATT-
Up to you.
-MARISHA-
Sick.
-SAM-
Yeah, let's do it.
-TALIESIN-
I for one am going to have some sleepy time tea.
-TRAVIS-
I lost a lot of hit points actually today.
I could use a recharge.
-TALIESIN-
Warm milk of the damned.
-LAURA-
All that thinking.
-SAM-
Okay, let's go to sleep.
-MARISHA-
Eat your cheerios, bud.
-MATT-
All right. You guys have an evening's rest in the second layer of hell, within the Iron City of Dis.
-LAURA-
Are the beds painfully hot?
-MATT-
The beds are warm. They're very toasty.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
It's like trying to fall asleep in middle of the summer in the Valley with no air conditioning.
It can be done. But you're sweaty and it's not very comfortable.
-MARISHA-
What, the sheets?
-LAURA-
The whole experience.
-MATT-
Maybe, yeah.
-SAM-
I have someone fanning me the entire night.
-MARISHA-
Doty.
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
It does help somewhat. You're the most comfortable sleeper in the entire group. All right, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom saving throw, if you don't mind.
-LAURA-
At advantage though, right? Because of the Heroes' Feast.
-MATT-
That's correct.
-TRAVIS-
Natural 20.
-SAM-
Natural 20 here as well.
-MARISHA-
I got a 17 and an 18, that's pretty damn good.
-TALIESIN-
That'll do. Wisdom saving?
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
19.
-LAURA-
11.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
32.
-SAM-
With advantage?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Vax?
-LIAM-
16.
-MATT-
Okay. You guys all awaken, rested, as you know, in a similar way you're rested after being out open under the night's sky on the side of the road in a campsite. It's not the best rest, but it's enough to at least continue with some wind back in your sails. Other than that, you are feeling a little bit hungry.
-TRAVIS-
How am I feeling?
-MATT-
You're feeling fine.
-MARISHA-
Don't we still have some rations that we have been carrying around with us for quite some time?
-LAURA-
I mean yeah, we have a lot of stuff in the bag of colding.
-TALIESIN-
Do we have any souls?
-TRAVIS-
The stuff downstairs is really not that bad.
-LAURA-
No souls in the bag of colding, but we do have--
-TALIESIN-
Is it not that bad or is it just slightly above awful?
-TRAVIS-
Yes?
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-LAURA-
We do have half a thing of boar meat and some grain. Just some random grain. Which I think is like oatmeal oats, maybe.
-TALIESIN-
Put some hot water on it and--
-LAURA-
All water here is hot.
-TALIESIN-
That's fair.
-LAURA-
I'm going to sit the boar meat down on the ground and cook it a little bit.
-MATT-
And actually it cooks pretty easily. There are portions of the iron metal, especially on the bottom floor, that cook it pretty well.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to use the gun barrel to sear it a bit.
-LAURA-
Yeah, make some grill marks on that thing.
-MATT-
All right. And you manage to cook a decent-- And the boar meat's been frozen for a while, so it's not the best, but it's better than bone splinter meat chunks.
-LAURA-
Or eating souls.
-TRAVIS-
Don't judge it until you try it.
-LAURA-
Did that use up all of the boar meat? Or am I down to like a quarter of a boar meat now?
-MATT-
How much did you have?
-LAURA-
Half a boar meat. I have no idea what that means.
-SAM-
Half a boar?
-MATT-
Half a boar meat? Half a boar, between all of you guys, including Grog's appetite, I'd say that's about it.
-LAURA-
It's gone?
-MATT-
That boar is gone.
-LAURA-
Damn it.
-LIAM-
That's like Super Nintendo lingo. Can I have half a boar meat?
-LAURA-
Oh, that's the worst eraser. It just made a pink smudge across the page.
-MATT-
Oh no!
-LAURA-
That's the worst.
-TALIESIN-
You'd like to try my eraser?
-LAURA-
No, this one's good.
-MATT-
Wow, we just had a very Oregon Trail moment.
I'm proud of us.
-LAURA-
Look at us using rations!
-SAM-
We've never done that before.
-MATT-
Not since the beginning, yeah. All righty.
-SAM-
All right. Where do we find this-- Oh, wait, did Zahra-- Vasa spend the night with us?
-MATT-
No.
-SAM-
Where is Vasa?
-MATT-
You have no idea.
-LAURA-
Downstairs, I assume.
-SAM-
All right. Should we go downstairs and find Vasa, because that's who's going to lead us to this place, right? Vasa! Vasa!
-TALIESIN-
Don't speak so loudly.
-SAM-
Well, you said not to whisper.
-TALIESIN-
I didn't say not to whisper.
-LAURA-
Don't make a scene, either. It's important.
-TALIESIN-
Act natural.
-LAURA-
Just be as cool and calm as possible.
-TALIESIN-
Yes. Don't act natural, be as cool and calm as possible.
-LIAM-
And he's doing that, unfortunately.
-SAM-
I'm always cool.
-TALIESIN-
That's the spirit. Just like that.
-LAURA-
Good acting.
-TRAVIS-
Do we see the imp downstairs anywhere?
-MATT-
As you head downstairs, you do notice that Ipkesh is sitting at one of the chairs at the far end of the bar. The usual keeper of the establishment is not currently there. There is nobody else in the bottom portion. It is empty, and the imp, Vasa, is currently resting on the shoulder of Ipkesh, as you approach.
-TRAVIS-
Close it down for a bit, did you?
-MATT-
"Just to be safe. Best not to have individuals knowing of our present arrangements or your group exit applying to me."
-LIAM-
You're going to introduce us to your little friend there?
-LAURA-
He did. It's Vasa.
-LIAM-
I know his name, thank you.
-MATT-
"Vasa will be able to bring you to your location. Vasa's mastery is in not being seen and keeping beneath the eyes of the Whisperers. Vasa will not be able to aid you in the confrontation, for Vasa is as strong as the parchment you signed yesterday."
-TALIESIN-
Any luck on those other materials? Silence spell or two?
-MATT-
"Mm-hm." And he pulls from a small satchel on the side of his long, black and purple robe, this small, leather case that is locked on one side. And as he pulls it open and reveals this very, very tightly wound piece of parchment, and he hands it over. "This is a Silence spell. I could not procure two, unfortunately. But this will aid you."
-LAURA-
The Whisperers you speak of. Do they see through illusions?
-MATT-
"The Whisperers, they do not see through illusions, but they do see through invisibility."
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
"At least-- not all of them. The bigger ones. If you see any that are larger than our winged compatriot here, those are the ones to avoid."
-LAURA-
Okay. I feel like a good idea would be to just--
-SAM-
Go?
-LAURA-
Yeah. But I mean, can't we just Alter Selves into little bugs or something, and get in behind him? Surprise him?
-SAM-
No, it's not a Polymorph spell.
-MARISHA-
I could Animal Shapes us there, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
How many of us?
-MARISHA-
All of us.
-TALIESIN-
Then you'd be down a spell.
-MARISHA-
Eighth level, but it could be worth it to not be seen and get the drop.
-TALIESIN-
Do you think that sounds like a reasonable plan or do you think that's--
-MATT-
"That sounds, if that is within your capability, that sounds very reasonable."
-LAURA-
And Vasa could get us into the keep? As insects?
-MATT-
"Vasa could show you the way in, yes."
-LAURA-
Could be good.
-SAM-
Are we-- yeah, are we wasting spells just to get there?
-LAURA-
A spell. But it's a surprise attack.
-MARISHA-
I imagine we'd get there, do Animal Shapes to get through and get to him.
-LAURA-
And then pop out and attack him, right from bugness.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. Bugness Everdeen.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. That was sour.
-LAURA-
I liked it.
-MARISHA-
Thank you. Laura liked it.
-LIAM-
With the right conditions, if we keep quiet, I can lay some pretty heavy hurt on this guy at the get-go. If we keep quiet.
-SAM-
All right. Let's bug it up, then.
-MATT-
So, this is Animal Shapes into a-- What form are you taking?
-TALIESIN-
Are we doing it now or later?
-MARISHA-
Later. Not now.
-MATT-
Right. But what form are you taking?
-MARISHA-
Let me figure that out. Who's got a Player's Handbook in the house?
-SAM-
Right here. 20 foot radius, centered on a point, not on a object.
-MARISHA-
Animal Shapes. What are you looking at?
-TALIESIN-
This is us. Looking at Silence spells.
-MATT-
Animal Shapes. Basically, you guys can become a large or smaller beast.
-MARISHA-
Large or smaller beast. So I can't do anything--
-LAURA-
We can't be insects? Are those beasts?
-MARISHA-
-- microscopic?
-MATT-
Micro-- No.
-MARISHA-
Not microscopic but tiny. I can't be tiny?
-MATT-
I mean, bird-size would be about as small as you could get.
-MARISHA-
Bird-size.
-TRAVIS-
Boy, that sure sounds like food.
-LAURA-
Yeah, are there any other creatures here that are small that go unseen? The size of rats or birds of some sort?
-MATT-
"I mean, there are fiendish variations and there are rats that exist on this plane, though life for them is not very enjoyable."
-LAURA-
Well, shit.
-TRAVIS-
We would be running on the blazing hot ground.
-LAURA-
Oh, right. Poor little burning rats.
-TRAVIS-
And flying in the imp-covered air.
-SAM-
Didn't he say Vasa can get us there, right? Can get us safe passage?
-LAURA-
Fuck it. I was just thinking it was a thing, but forget it.
-TRAVIS-
It's all in the contract.
-MATT-
"So. Shall Vasa guide you?"
-LAURA-
Yes, let's do it.
-MATT-
"Very well." Taps the edge and Vasa's been watching, goes, "Come follow me." And takes off of the side of his shoulder.
-LAURA-
He talks?
-MATT-
You guys have spoken with an imp before. And the imp (fwsh) out the window, grabs onto the side of the doorframe, and then scurries onto the outside and turns back around and looks inside.
"Come. Come."
-TRAVIS-
We go. We follow.
-SAM-
I will lead us.
-TRAVIS-
Do we need Pass Without A Trace?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I cast Pass Without A Trace on us.
-MARISHA-
I'm Alter Selfing into my tiefling form.
-MATT-
All righty. That being the case, you guys step outside onto the street and you watch as Vasa disappears down the same alleyway that you previously had nearly been assaulted in, Keyleth.
You guys, I need you all to make stealth checks.
-TALIESIN-
With advantage?
-LAURA-
Yeah. No, add ten.
-MARISHA-
That's good.
-TRAVIS-
Motherfucker. Natural 20.
-MATT-
Jesus.
-TRAVIS-
Two in a row.
-TALIESIN-
30.
-SAM-
24.
-MARISHA-
38.
-LIAM-
44.
-LAURA-
39.
-MATT-
All right. So, for the first leg of this journey, as you're watching as Vasa is darting from edge to edge and occasionally almost dematerializing and turning invisible. And for a moment you have to stop and look around, and then you watch his form appear off in the distance and shoot up a tiny little lit flare to gather your attention once any large Whisperers pass overhead.
And this process of rubberbanding behind Vasa continues over the next half an hour or so, going deeper and deeper into the city. And as you go, Vex, you're keeping a pretty close watch on where you're coming from, though you're also seeing large groups of lemures, which is how it's pronounced as I've been corrected and I'm so glad it's pronounced that and not lemurs, because that sounds awful as hell. It's lemure.
-MARISHA-
But lemurs are so cute.
-MATT-
I know. And they're not cute. They're horrible, fleshy, tortured souls.
-LIAM-
That's my nickname, man. Don't shit on my nickname.
-MARISHA-
Lemurs!
-MATT-
You see clusters of lemures throughout the city. As well as low-level spine devils and some other fiendish creatures that are in the process of rebuilding and reconstructing buildings, and tearing down others. You start seeing elements of the city are constantly in a state of being restructured, rebuilt. Sometimes more grandiose, sometimes more awful and terrifying. And you get the sense that the city is in a perpetual state of flux. That gleaming, iron tower still just beyond your visual sight whenever you have to readjust your vision across the horizon. I need you guys to all make another stealth check. For these different steps of the journey.
-TRAVIS-
25.
-MARISHA-
29.
-SAM-
16.
-TRAVIS-
With the plus ten?
-SAM-
Mm-hm.
-LAURA-
22.
-TALIESIN-
Natural one.
-MARISHA-
No, Percy!
-TRAVIS-
Come on, golden snitch.
-MARISHA-
Come on, Freddie.
-TALIESIN-
There was something about that coffee cup being there. There we go.
-LIAM-
Can I share some of my 37 with Percy?
-MATT-
Doesn't-- So as you guys are moving along, watching Vasa, Vasa eventually gets out of sight for a moment and you all stop and pull back. And you see a flash of light that signifies Vasa calling you forward and that it's safe. And as you all move forward, you watch as Taryon and Percival were both looking behind, keeping watch on your back, and by the time they look back you guys are already about 20 feet ahead. And as they rush forward, Percival straight up-- His foot hits the edge of where two of the iron rifts in the ground, the plating that meets up this part of the alleyway. He stumbles forward, landing hard on his elbow and giving out a (groan) of his breath. And as he does, you hear a (imp sound) and you watch as a small, impish creature in golden armor begins to crawl over the roof of the nearby building and look over the side.
-TALIESIN-
I turn and break away from the group and head in a slightly different direction for a moment and sit and nurse my elbow, and try and just look like I'm dealing with my medical issue and really try to look like I didn't notice the thing that's watching me now.
-MATT-
Okay. I want you to go and make a deception check. No, you have to roll if it's intentional.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Meh. Deception?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Nine.
-MATT-
Nine? Okay. So you watch the creature (imp sounds) and slowly crawls along the top of the roof, as you go and split off from the rest of the party. You hear behind you the (imp talking) some sort of conversation, and then a second one appears. And one continues to follow you, while the other one continues to move with Taryon.
-TALIESIN-
Do I have any of the soul--
-SAM-
Did I see him break off?
-MATT-
Yeah, you watch as, after he gets back up, he breaks off from the rest of the group.
-SAM-
I'm going to stick with him.
-MATT-
Okay. So you're both now being followed by two of these--
-TALIESIN-
One moment. I'm going to pull out a piece of the soul, the edible soul, and just about to eat it.
-LIAM-
Do the rest of us see this, by the way?
-MATT-
You all just made it past this open walkway in the street, turned around another alley, and you watched this happen across the way. They're about 15, 20 feet from you, in an open road.
-LIAM-
I'm going to quietly follow behind the imps.
-MATT-
The imps are on the other side of the road from you right now. If you want to, you can try in a moment.
-LIAM-
Oh, never mind.
-TALIESIN-
I'm trying something. I've got the shard of soul out, the soul shard. Giving it a smell.
And I'm going to, not quite loudly, but with a bit (disgusted sound) and I'm going to huck it in the other direction with distaste.
-MATT-
Okay. One of the two imps breaks off and swoops down after it, and immediately runs over and starts scattering across the ground trying to catch it as it tumbles off of the side. The other one continues to follow after the two of you.
-TALIESIN-
Can we try and give it the slip?
-SAM-
I can try to make us invisible.
-TALIESIN-
It won't work.
-SAM-
It won't work?
-LAURA-
They see through invisibility.
-SAM-
All right.
-MATT-
The bigger ones do.
-LAURA-
I thought you said the Whisperers saw through invisibility?
-MATT-
Some of the Whisperers do, some don't. He said be wary of the bigger ones. They see through invisibility and possibly other things.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-SAM-
What do you think?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to dust myself off and try and just meander into a shadow. I still have Pass Without a Trace.
-MATT-
You do, yes.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to see if I can just vanish stealthily.
-MATT-
Okay. Make it with disadvantage, because you are being actively watched.
-TALIESIN-
I am being actively watched?
-MATT-
You can turn around the corner and attempt it, but you know. It is aware that you walked there, so your ability to slip out of its view once you break from its line of sight is going to be this check.
-TALIESIN-
I'm also going to-- Can I also use my boots of spider walking to see if I can crawl off the street a little bit and see if I can--
-MATT-
Sure, let's try it. Go ahead and make your stealth check.
-TRAVIS-
You can certainly try.
-TALIESIN-
Disadvantage. I hate disadvantage so much. That's cocked. It doesn't matter though, it's awful. Yeah, never mind, I fail.
-MATT-
Okay. So, as you turn around the corner, you step onto the side of the wall. Hearing the impact of the boots across the iron side. Thankfully, it's enchanted boots, so the damage is relatively minimal, but you do hear the very faint sizzle of leather on hot metal. What are you doing, Tary?
-SAM-
Well. I will cast Invisibility on myself.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
And that's all I can do for my turn.
-MATT-
So as this one is following Percival around the corner, the one that was going after you, that was distracted by the stone, you turn invisible, and it glances around and has lost sight of you for the moment. And it continues to push after Percival.
-SAM-
I'm going to stick with Percival, but in an invisible way.
-TALIESIN-
I'm just-- I'm going to keep talking over the headphones, trying to keep up with where everyone else is, but walking off a block, in the hopes of sort of bullshitting my way through this.
-MATT-
As you head down this alleyway, and you guys are parallel following on the side, watching this from a distance, but staying out of sight, without making yourselves visible. Percival, you look up and you see this strange, eerie green glow that begins to drift in your direction. You watch as these spectral arms begin to drift up out of the ground, and this elongated horrifying face pulls up from underneath the darkened cobblestones of the street. And this specter entity drifts in your direction.
-TALIESIN-
Do I recognize what this specter entity is?
-MATT-
It's some sort of a ghost-like creature.
You've seen a number of these emanating and drifting through the city, some in small clusters, some individually.
They seem to wander aimlessly throughout.
-SAM-
I am whispering the incantation for Invisibility into a coin.
-MATT-
Okay. That takes a minute to do it.
-SAM-
It does? Fuck. Then I'm not doing it.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to try and keep pace with that thing. Is it following me?
-MATT-
You glance over your shoulder and see it and it is currently crawled around the side and it's leaping from these windowsills, these small iron squares that are about that big, that are built into the side of these walls here. It's leaping and flying from section to section, staying immediately 15 feet, 20 feet behind you.
-LIAM-
Can I trail this thing?
-MATT-
Do you want to go and follow?
-SAM-
You said 20 feet behind us?
-MATT-
It's about 20 feet behind you, yeah.
-SAM-
And up?
-MATT-
Yeah, about 15 feet up.
-SAM-
All right, I'm going to reach into my alchemist's satchel and pull out a bag of writhing sticky black tar and hurl it right at his feet.
MATT; Okay. It's leaping from windowsill to windowsill, and as it gets to one windowsill you chuck at it?
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right, go for it, roll for an attack.
-SAM-
What is this, plus my spell attack bonus? No, it's just an attack? What is this?
-MATT-
It should say under your ability here. I'll pull it up if you want.
-SAM-
Am I rolling for the throw, or for the spell?
-MATT-
This is for the throw. Or, is it the creature's saving throw, which is it? Which of the two? Let me go look, actually.
-TALIESIN-
I just had five of the worst rolls I've ever had in a row. That was just ugly. There was just ugliness happening, and I don't feel it's gone yet. It's not the dice, it's in me.
-MATT-
This is the tanglefoot bag?
-MARISHA-
That's what happens when you sell out, man.
-TALIESIN-
Shut up.
-MATT-
So what you do is, it splats against it, and you watch it (choking noise), it gets stuck and sapped into it. It's moving now at half pace, it's having to pull through this substance that's glued to its feet and it's trying to tear away.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
That's all I got.
-LIAM-
I got a 46 on stealth, can I--
-MATT-
You turn around the corner now and you see, first off, Taryon appears, because when you throw the bag it breaks your invisibility.
-SAM-
It's an attack?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Shit. Okay, it's worth it.
-MATT-
So now you see Percival and Taryon both appear, and this one impish creature is now currently partially glued to a wall and is fighting, trying to pull its way out.
-SAM-
Let's run!
-LIAM-
It looks like a target. Whisper.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
With a 46 stealth.
-MATT-
Yeah. So go ahead and roll.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-LIAM-
Would this be a surprise, if I'm that stealthed?
-MATT-
No. It is aware that there are threats in its vicinity, so it's not a surprise attack. But it does not see you, so you have advantage on the attack. It is considered a Sneak Attack if you hit it.
-LIAM-
25 to hit.
-MATT-
Yeah, that hits.
-LIAM-
All right. 12, and I will do a second attack as well.
-MATT-
How much damage is the first attack?
-LIAM-
12.
-MATT-
12 damage? It's Sneak Attack, because it didn't see you.
-LIAM-
Oh wait no, it is Sneak Attack, right? Thanks. 12, 25, 27, 33, 35, 42, plus psychic damage from that, 42, so 45.
-MATT-
So right as it's pulling away from this tanglefoot bag, this explosion of glue, it's like (rasping noise), and the dagger just slips through it, and you watch as it goes in four different pieces and retracts into the tanglefoot bag muck once more. It got completely shredded, and the sections are withdrawn back and stuck to it as it is slowly now dribbling out of this massive glue on the side of the building, which is now starting to bubble from the heat from the side of this structure.
-ALL-
Tar pits.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take this opportunity to try and turn another corner.
-MATT-
Okay. The impish creature that was distracted by your stone is now attempting to catch up. I want the three of you to make one more stealth check, since you've all revealed yourselves.
-MARISHA-
Come on! Don't fuck up, Percy! Don't fuck up! It's all right.
-TALIESIN-
23!
-SAM-
24.
-LIAM-
37.
-MATT-
Okay. You guys, darting into the shadows, rush around the corner. You hear in the distance the clattering of tiny imp claws, and the impacts of it doing the same perch-to-perch, gliding through the alleyway. You turn the corner and join up with the rest of the party. You hear in the distance some sort of a distant barking call in the language you don't understand.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, like raptors.
-MARISHA-
I was going to say, Jurassic Park.
-LAURA-
They're going to be the lookout now.
-MATT-
You gather that they've acknowledged that there has been a Whisperer slain in the alley, so you might want to hurry.
-ALL-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As you guys collectively catch up with Vasa and are led further into the city, you begin to hear now this horrible grinding sound of metal that becomes omnipresent farther down this labyrinthine network of alleys and streets. You can see the glow of red and orange, that previously just emanated from the horizon, is now beginning to light the sky around you. It's this light pollution from some sort of nearby source.
As you turn one of the corners, you look and see giant pyres of molten metal and fire. There is a gargantuan forge where people are-- I say people, these devilish entities-- and hundreds of lemures are just heaping large bits of iron ingots and scrap metal from fallen buildings and tossing them into this forge. Every time they do, there's a burst of flame and ash and cinder come pouring out of it. From there, you can see refined metals being pulled out and brought to other elements of this city. Beyond that, as you glance over, you can hear this faint echoing sound of hundreds upon hundreds of voices, all moaning, screaming, squealing, in torturous pain. You don't have a view of what's causing it, but this whole area of this city just brings this terrifying presence of all the torment you'd expect from somewhere in the Hells. As you pause a moment, Vasa darts back, trying to usher you forward in the direction of the sound. "Come, come, follow." And then vanishes once again, appearing on the other side of the street, and then beckoning you once more. For the last leg, I need everyone to make one more stealth check.
-TRAVIS-
Come on, Percy, for fuck's sake.
-MARISHA-
All of us?
-MATT-
All of you.
-TALIESIN-
Better.
-SAM-
22.
-TRAVIS-
23.
-MARISHA-
34.
-TALIESIN-
27.
-LAURA-
26.
-LIAM-
37.
-MATT-
Okay. As you're waiting for the right moment to cross the street, you wait for one cluster of these tiny winged, not quite imps, they're a little larger than imps, with this dark bluish-green spine protrusions out of the wings, and their heads are these giant bony ridges that go back, and they have these long spears. And about two dozen of them come down this street in a vast cluster, almost like a bat storm, a whole bunch of just randomly flying and angrily screeching creatures. And as you wait for that to pass, the minute that sound goes past, you dart across the alleyway and make it to the other side and turn just in time for the large heavy footfalls of what looks to be some sort of monstrosity. Multiple arms that are stitched to this large golem-like creature. It's humanoid, but it's about 15 feet tall, and it's just covered in stitches. Multiple chunks of different faces that are all just sewn together in places. You can see this series of gems that are imbedded in its shoulders and part of its throat that all pulse, like separate heartbeats that are out of pace with each other, and as it stumbles forward you see a chain around its neck and it's being dragged by this tiny imp that's just pulling it forward and tugging on it. It doesn't even make much of a noise other than a perpetual gurgle, but it's just some sort of flesh-stitched automaton that's being dragged forward to its next physical activity at the behest of whoever owns it.
-LAURA-
Freddie, you can't end up here.
-TALIESIN-
No.
-MATT-
A few moments later, Vasa brings you to the outside of a large jet-black metallic and stone structure. A heavy thick-walled stronghold with a series of what looks like-- imagine a thick bramble forest made of twisted iron that surrounds the base of it, about five feet high. There are small gaps where you guys can try and squeeze through, for the more lithe folk. Grog, you're not quite sure how you're going to get over this without tearing bits of you apart. There's about a ten foot gap between this strange metal bramble fence, and the outside of this stronghold.
-LAURA-
After I go through, stay here. I pop Trinket out, and then I reach my necklace through and say, get in.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
Grog, you get inside. You release him out on the other side.
-LAURA-
I put Trinket back in.
-MATT-
All right. Well done.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa. That was easier than I thought.
-MATT-
At which point you now have Doty on the other side just going (smashing noises).
-TRAVIS-
You can put Doty in there. I farted while I was inside.
-LAURA-
I don't think Doty can go in there, it's only for living creatures. I can try.
Get in, Doty.
-TALIESIN-
Tell Doty to get in.
-MATT-
No effect.
-LAURA-
Nothing?
-TALIESIN-
Tell Doty to get in, maybe.
-SAM-
Doty, try your best to get in.
-LAURA-
No, no, no.
-SAM-
It's fine. I'll cast Fly on Doty.
-LAURA-
Don't you think that's going to be noticeable?
-SAM-
How high up is it?
-TRAVIS-
It's only five feet high.
-SAM-
Wait, don't we have a magic carpet or something?
-LAURA-
Yeah, but we're trying to be stealthy.
-SAM-
Stealthy. With a robot.
-LIAM-
He can just edge along the top of the iron, yeah?
-MATT-
You guys have been good enough to keep far enough ahead that this wandering metallic automaton about 25 feet behind you hasn't drawn any strange attention. Yet.
-MARISHA-
Are there fissures? Steam vents?
-MATT-
No steam vents that you can see, it's just this tangled mass of thick metal cables, maybe about a foot thick, that have spikes jutting out of them. It's climbable, but there may be some damage taken in the process.
-LAURA-
He said take the easiest way in.
-SAM-
He said that?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-SAM-
Well then, Doty, go straight through.
-MATT-
Doty then reaches out and (metal noises) and it takes a few moments but Doty begins to actually force the brambles apart and you can see bits of the metal (clinking) and bits of the spikes jutting through and breaking parts of the armor from the opposite side and are piercing it. It does manage to pull enough of an opening where Doty squeezes through and gets to the other side.
However, Doty does suffer 12 points of piercing damage in the process, but emerges.
-SAM-
You're so badass, Doty. Good job.
-TALIESIN-
Perhaps we should bend them back?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, how noticeable is the bent bars?
-MATT-
It's pretty noticeable, it's about that big around.
-TALIESIN-
Can Doty put it back?
-LIAM-
Is it Doty-shaped?
-TRAVIS-
I'll do it.
-MARISHA-
Go, Grog.
-MATT-
Roll a strength check.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-MATT-
It takes you a little bit of time, and you manage to squeeze it together.
-LAURA-
Plus you put the gauntlets on, which are good for structures, right?
-MATT-
You do take three points of piercing damage.
That's essentially why he's able to do it on a roll of 15, because of his Siege ability. You do manage to squeeze it back together and close the hole.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
Magic carpentry.
-MATT-
Now, Vasa you see is now up on the side of this wall, and this stronghold has nearly no openings on any other side. However, there is a small sliver of an opening, it's almost like an exhaust on the higher end there, and Vasa is currently perched up onto it.
-SAM-
How high?
-MATT-
About seven feet up.
-SAM-
And how wide is this door?
-MATT-
It's about a foot and a half high and about two and a half, three feet wide.
-LAURA-
Great.
-SAM-
We want to get into this place, right?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Well then, let's have a door. And I will pull my A Door out of my Robe of Useful Items and it put it on the side of the wall.
-TRAVIS-
You do what?
-MATT-
He pulls a patch out off of his robe and tears it off and slams it against the stone. As it does, you watch as, what was once solid black metal, a tiny seam of orange appears in a large rectangular pattern, and then opens ever so slightly on a hinge that wasn't there before.
-SAM-
After you.
-TALIESIN-
Well, that's my kind of ridiculous.
-LIAM-
He's not the hero we wanted, but he's the hero we need.
(laughter)
-SAM-
This door cost a lot of money, just so you know.
-LAURA-
Good to know.
-MATT-
As you guys peer inside, ever so carefully, do you guys want to--
-LAURA-
Very carefully, I want to just peek in.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-MARISHA-
Do we still have Pass Without a Trace on?
-LAURA-
Ah! Nah, I don't see shit.
-MATT-
It is very dark inside, there's a faint bit of almost like candlelight out of view, you can see there's a shifting glow internally that seems to have a life of a small flame.
-LIAM-
I gently push my sister to the side and try the same.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
Yeah. 24.
-MATT-
Okay. As you glance inside of it, you can see there's a series of chains dangling from the ceiling carrying hooks on them. A number of these hooks seem to have a dried reddish caked blood-like material, some of them have bits of flesh still stripped and dangling from them. There are two tables in this chamber, each table seemingly containing some sort of a humanoid body that is placed on it and strapped down. One appears to be in two pieces. There is a torso and there are legs, and the center piece that once held the parts together is nowhere near in sight.
Too shadowed to make any details from this angle, as you've just peered past the door, but there does not appear to be any other moving or living creature in the chamber that you can see.
-LIAM-
So none of those forms are moving, breathing, anything, as far as I can tell.
-MATT-
As far as you can tell.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You take a moment longer and you see the one on the far table is breathing.
-LIAM-
All right. We have some deadish things in here, kind of moving--
-LAURA-
Dangerous things, or--
-LIAM-
It looks like it. I'd like to go in and get a closer look. Is everybody cool with that?
-MATT-
All right, roll a stealth check.
-LIAM-
That's fine. That's 40 with the Pass Without a Trace.
-MATT-
Okay. As you slowly slip into the chamber, closing the door ever so slightly to make just the faintest creaking of metal on metal, you slip into the chamber, and you can see there's shelves with various torture instruments just strewn across it.
It looks like a terrible nightmare version of Percy's work chamber back in Greyskull Keep. There are two doors in the room, one on the north side and one on the eastern side, and the body that's on one table you can see appears to be human, older male. There are signs of some sort of physical scarring on the body, whether it be necromantic or corruption-based, it has been long dead. There is a very strong smell of decay. The other table, you do see the slight moving chest of a living dwarf, a female dwarf that appears to be passed out, unconscious, and has suffered quite a bit of torturous wounds. You can see hundreds of small scratches and jagged dagger wounds in the side of the shoulders and arms, the face, and is currently strapped down to the table.
-LIAM-
I'm going to use Divine Sense in this room.
Am I within 50, 60 feet of that dwarf?
-MATT-
You are, yes.
-LIAM-
Yeah, Divine Sense.
-MATT-
Divine Sense, to sense--
-LIAM-
Presence of strong evil registers on my senses.
-MATT-
Within 60 feet of you. All right. Nothing coming from that dwarf, but there are a number of other sources throughout the fortress. Not in the room, but within 60 feet of you, you get a view of the chamber to the north of you and a chamber to the east of you. The eastern chamber, nothing. The chamber to the north of you, just beyond that door, there is a signature.
-LIAM-
And the dwarf appears alive?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Yeah. There's a woman dwarf in the room ahead of us.
-LAURA-
Is she dangerous?
-LIAM-
Hard to say, I don't think so, but I don't know.
-MARISHA-
Does she look familiar?
-SAM-
Why don't we go in and look?
-MATT-
You guys all quietly make your way into the chambers.
-LAURA-
So quietly.
-LIAM-
I'm going to inch ahead of everybody.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Does she look like she regrets her decisions in life?
-LAURA-
Does she look like she belongs here? Is she naked?
-SAM-
Does she have any unfortunate tattoos?
-MATT-
She's not naked, she's wearing basic cloth clothing, but a lot of it has been torn and soaked deep, deep crimson with blood. A lot of it appears to be torn from stress and tension. There are claw marks from all over this chamber, from various demonic entities that have torn through here, but the table she's on as well.
-LAURA-
I go join my brother.
-TALIESIN-
I think this is a brilliant opportunity.
-LIAM-
I mean, she's not melted, like the poor shits we've seen all over this city.
-MATT-
The body suddenly stirs on the table.
-SAM-
Hello.
-LAURA-
Are you awake?
-MATT-
Noelle, if you want to step on in?
-TALIESIN-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Oh no!
-LAURA-
Oh shit! (laughter)
-SAM-
That just took, like, ten minutes to find her.
-TRAVIS-
Come on in, come on in!
-TALIESIN-
Before we do this, can we have a ten-minute discussion about whether or not to--
-LAURA-
You've been sitting there this whole damn time?
-NOELLE-
Oh no, you guys were shopping, I get it.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Already sass!
-NOELLE-
It was just some light torture.
-LAURA-
Oh shit, what if she wouldn't have been tortured if we'd gotten here earlier?
-SAM-
By the way, for any future guests who want to come on the show, we don't normally treat our guests this way.
-TALIESIN-
There's actually three more guests still waiting in line.
-SAM-
They've been here for weeks!
-NOELLE-
It was horrible.
-MATT-
You hear a noise, and as you come to in the darkened room with just the faint glow of the candelabra in the corner. You glance over a dart and you see a series of shapes filtering in from a door that you haven't noticed before in the chamber, and begin whispering to each other and then looking over to you occasionally. One of them suddenly goes "Hello," and the rest go "shh."
-LAURA-
Are you alive?
-SAM-
Hello!
-NOELLE-
I just sigh heavily and I go, who the fuck are you?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to gingerly go over and very quietly say: we are a remarkable opportunity if you're willing to be quiet and maybe have a little faith in the truth in this very dark place.
-NOELLE-
Okay.
(laughter)
-SAM-
She's bleeding from her eyes.
-MATT-
As you get a close look at her, too, you see she has darker auburn red hair with a shock of white-gray in it, shaved on the sides, one gnarled ear that has been chewed and torn and a series of scratch scars across the front of her face.
-SAM-
I will grab a healing draught and offer it.
-LAURA-
I can cast Cure Wounds on her.
-TRAVIS-
Let's not fight, just heal her.
-LAURA-
I just want to know if it's safe to heal her.
-TALIESIN-
Heal her.
-LAURA-
How did you get here?
-NOELLE-
That's a pretty long story.
-SAM-
We've got nothing but time.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
Is it safe to release you?
-NOELLE-
Yes. Can I get off this table, please? What are we doing?
-SAM-
Is she lashed to it?
-MATT-
She is manacled to it. Both ankles and wrists are manacled to this table.
-LAURA-
I cast Cure Wounds on her.
-LIAM-
Are the manacles trapped at all? I'm going to check for traps.
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-LIAM-
Really high.
-LAURA-
Let's make a deal. We let you go, you don't let anyone know we're here, and you don't try to kill us.
-NOELLE-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Can I insight check her?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh, I got the worst insight ever into her. Ten.
-TRAVIS-
I'll do it. 12.
-LAURA-
She seems really honest.
-MATT-
What did you get?
-LAURA-
Ten.
-MATT-
She's hard to read. She seems brusque and, honestly, chained to a table and probably tortured.
-NOELLE-
The blood doesn't help.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I'll cast Cure Wounds at third level.
-SAM-
Nothing you can do is as powerful as what I was about to give her.
-LAURA-
Oh, really?
-SAM-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Oh, then, never mind.
-MATT-
It's too late, you cast Cure Wounds. Go ahead and roll for it.
-LAURA-
Fine. I'm trying to be nice, trying to save you a damn spell.
-MATT-
You hear Taryon say that as soon as you finish casting the spell into the dwarf woman.
-SAM-
We'll see how well-- hmm.
-LAURA-
18, plus--
-TALIESIN-
That is the most condescending "hmm" I think I've ever experienced!
-LAURA-
Do I add anything?
-MATT-
You add your wisdom modifier.
-LAURA-
18 plus three. 21 whole points.
-MATT-
Where once you're groggy, the sudden flash of the divine energy and the healing power that sifts through your body, it brings a moment of respite and calmness to you, and you feel a lot better than you did a few moments ago.
-NOELLE-
Cool. Can I get off this table now?
-LAURA-
Vax, can you help me pick these locks?
-MATT-
What did you roll, Vax?
-LIAM-
Oh, a 31 or 33.
-MATT-
Yeah, the manacles are not trapped.
-LIAM-
All right. All right, give us a second, my sister and I will.
-LAURA-
I'll work on the legs if you work on the hands.
-MATT-
All right. So, go ahead, both you guys roll to pick locks.
-LAURA-
Which is what?
-LIAM-
30.
-MATT-
Dex bonus plus your proficiency bonus.
-LAURA-
Oh. Awesome.
-SAM-
(whispers) What's your name?
-NOELLE-
What?
-SAM-
What's your name?
-NOELLE-
Why are we whispering?
-SAM-
There's bad guys everywhere, we're in hell!
-NOELLE-
Oh, right.
-LAURA-
24.
-MATT-
Okay, you guys take a quick moment and very deftly and very quietly, the twins in unison release the manacles and you instinctively sit up and rub your wrists.
-MARISHA-
Wow, have you guys been rehearsing that? That was impressive. Good job, twins!
-NOELLE-
Whoa, there's two of them. Fuck.
-MARISHA-
I know, it's confusing sometimes.
-NOELLE-
What's your name?
-SAM-
(whispers) What's your name?
-NOELLE-
I'm Tova.
-ALL-
Tova.
-NOELLE-
Who the fuck are you? Why are you in here?
-LIAM-
Well, we're tourists.
-MARISHA-
Well, this is Freddie, that's Yrat, that's Wade and Wode, and that's Greg.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, let's not give too much info.
-MARISHA-
You can call us Mox Vachina.
-TALIESIN-
Let's put it this way. We're sneaking into this unholy compound in Dis, basically a city of hell, to do something inappropriate, we find you tied to a table, we figure that maybe you're in the mood to --
-LAURA-
Help out?
-SAM-
Did you see season two of Prison Break? Because that's what we're doing.
-LIAM-
We're here to solve a problem.
-NOELLE-
Are we killing something?
-ALL-
Yes.
-NOELLE-
Can I come?
-TALIESIN-
Who put you here?
-LAURA-
Where's your shit?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, Tova, did you have a weapon when you were brought here?
-NOELLE-
I did, it was really cool, too. Can we go find it?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, what'd you have?
-NOELLE-
Oh, shouldn't have moved that fast, hang on. Yeah, I have a maul.
-TRAVIS-
Really?
-NOELLE-
It's really cool, it's here somewhere. I don't know where.
-TRAVIS-
Should we look around the room for the maul?
-NOELLE-
How healed am I?
-MATT-
With that, you're back to full.
-NOELLE-
Oh, cool!
-MATT-
Because you've been resting for a while and recovering from the wounds of the last torture session.
-MARISHA-
So there's no one else in here, right? Is it still dark?
-MATT-
The chamber has low flickering light from two different candelabras, one near you guys in the corner and one near the center doorways over here.
-LIAM-
I get the flametongue dagger out. Is your shit on the walls around here? Do you see it in here?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I light up my hands.
-MATT-
You guys do a quick pass. You look around, and there are some chests around here and you carefully go through some of them that are left open, and you do not see any of your equipment within the room.
-LAURA-
Do you see anything cool there?
-NOELLE-
Is there anything I can use?
-MATT-
There are a number of torture implements.
-NOELLE-
Can I have one?
-MATT-
Yeah. Of the things that look most useful to you, there's a giant iron fork.
There are chained hooks.
-LAURA-
Pike would be so happy right now, she loves torture devices.
-NOELLE-
I'll get that big ol' fork.
-MATT-
It's a two-pronged long, thick metal fork.
-NOELLE-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Not to slow your roll or nothing but I have a greatsword if you want one.
-NOELLE-
Ooh, yeah! No, that sounds better.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-NOELLE-
I put the fork back.
-TRAVIS-
Are you sure you can handle a greatsword? It's, like, big league.
-NOELLE-
I'm very strong. It's probably bigger than I am.
-MATT-
But as a dwarf, you're stocky and strong with your background as well, it's not really an issue.
-MARISHA-
Tova, that sword makes you look so tall.
-NOELLE-
Thank you.
-TRAVIS-
What the fuck happened to your face? Shit.
-NOELLE-
Oh, this was preexisting, actually.
Unfortunate home chemistry set accident.
-SAM-
Ooh, are you an alchemist?
-NOELLE-
It wasn't my chemistry set.
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
At this point, you hear a (click) sound and a door beginning to open on the north end of the wall.
-LAURA-
Oh shit, hide! Hide under the table!
-TRAVIS-
I fall flat on the floor.
-SAM-
I go still as a statue.
-MATT-
Make stealth checks, Taryon and Grog with disadvantage.
-MARISHA-
Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we still have Pass Without a Trace.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, that's good.
-MARISHA-
Okay, cool.
-SAM-
19 for me.
-TRAVIS-
A 19 and a 20. A natural 19 and a natural 20.
-MATT-
With disadvantage, you got a 19? Holy shit! Oh, plus-- yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
So, 21, 31.
-NOELLE-
Am I joining in here? Or can I just get back on the table?
-MATT-
You can get on the table if you want.
-NOELLE-
All right, so I get back on the table.
-MATT-
All right, but you do it noisily.
-NOELLE-
I flop down on the table.
-MATT-
All right. So the door opens, and as it does--
-LAURA-
Oh god, oh god. Ah! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
-TALIESIN-
18.
-SAM-
It's a map, it's a map!
-MATT-
A creature comes through, similar to Ipkesh, another humanoid, this one a little thicker, burlier, with a medium-grey hair that is kind of a tangled mass all into dreads right past the shoulders. Big, leathery red wings, red skin, horns at the front, and has a big sword it kind of is pulling out of a sheath on the side of it as it comes in, looking around the room. Which-- Immediately kind of steps into the chamber, as you guys all hide off to the side. "Shit!" And is going to turn around and just go running in the opposite direction.
-LAURA-
No! I shoot an arrow in the back of his neck.
-MATT-
Okay, so, this going to be a surprise-- Not a surprise round, it knows you guys are there, but this-- this is going to be a roll for initiative.
Everyone, roll some initiative.
-MARISHA-
Yeah! Yes. Yes! That's bad, that's a natural one!
-MATT-
(laughs) Oh, man.
-MARISHA-
I was so excited and then it went away so quickly!
-MATT-
All righty. So, top of the round, we have 25 to 20. Anybody?
-TALIESIN-
28.
-MATT-
28, Jesus Christ! Okay.
25 to 20, anybody? Good?
-NOELLE-
21.
-MATT-
Oh, 21. Nice! All righty, 20 to 15?
-LIAM-
18.
-MATT-
18. All right.
-LAURA-
16.
-MATT-
16. 15 to ten?
-TRAVIS-
14.
-MATT-
Ten to five? Five to one?
-SAM-
Four.
-MARISHA-
Three?
-MATT-
Oh.
-LAURA-
No.
-LIAM-
Oh, kids.
-MATT-
All righty. Percival, you're up first. You see this devilish humanoid--
-SAM-
See you in 20 minutes.
-MATT-
-- beginning to pivot and turn.
-TALIESIN-
Can you point to me on the map?
-MATT-
You are right there.
-LAURA-
Don't use the gun. (muffled) Don't use the gun.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, I'm going to do a couple things.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Blow the cover for everyone.
-TALIESIN-
Blow the cover for ev-- well.
-LAURA-
No. Don't use the gun.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take my movement to run around him and shut the door.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Using my boots. 'Cause my boots are already active.
-MATT-
Right. The doorway is about the size of him, so you--
-TALIESIN-
Oh, it's too big?
-MATT-
I mean, it takes up the entire doorway, essentially, and it's just pivoting after it notices you guys, so you're gonna have to make a tumble check to try and make it past him.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, okay, hold on then.
-MATT-
An acrobatics roll, but yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'll-- you know what, I'll do the acrobatics roll to try and shut the door, and--
-MATT-
Okay, so you're trying to, basically, as he goes to spin around, you dash forward, and roll into a tumble to try and pop up on the other side, so go ahead and roll acrobatics check.
-TALIESIN-
That'll do. 22.
-MATT-
22.
-LAURA-
Will it do?
-MATT-
Natural 20 on his end.
-MARISHA-
Aw!
-MATT-
So, as you tumble, not even noticing-- The world spins as you go into a roll and suddenly there's just a flash of white, and there's just a foot, a massive boot in your face as the individual slams a kick into your head to stop you from tumbling forward, and you stop in place. So you're currently prone on the ground, but you still have your action if you want to.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take three slashes at him with my sword.
-MATT-
Go for it. You are prone. You have disadvantage on your attack rolls.
-TALIESIN-
Disadvantage on the attack rolls?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
But I am prone. Okay, so, attack number one. That don't matter. 28?
-MATT-
That hits.
-TALIESIN-
Just do attack number two. That's 15.
-MATT-
15 misses.
-MARISHA-
Come on, come on.
-TALIESIN-
And, uh, 24.
-MATT-
That hits. Go ahead and roll damage twice.
-TALIESIN-
Got two hits with the-- what's-- these.
-MATT-
And, Tova, you're up next, so be ready.
-SAM-
Tova!
-TALIESIN-
Two hits, so that's--
-LIAM-
Is it the quiet gun?
-TALIESIN-
I'm using a sword, not a gun, so that's--
-LIAM-
Oh, right, right, right.
-TALIESIN-
That's 18 points of damage.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
18 points of damage, and, you know, let's just burn a little bit of electricity too, just to hurt him as well.
-LIAM-
Oh, yes.
-MATT-
18 from both strikes?
-TALIESIN-
That's everything combined.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
And then let's do a-- where is-- here we are. Let's do a-- where is the damage? 1d6 lightning, so let's just burn two charges of that as well.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
I'm out of d6s for some reason that I cannot comprehend.
-SAM-
Here. Here.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you.
-LAURA-
Ooh.
-TALIESIN-
And let's add five points of lightning damage to that as well.
-MATT-
All righty. So, as you land on the ground, you pull your sword out and just swipe three times in the air, two of them striking across its thigh and the kneecap. It still stands, but you see it took a nice, sizable chunk out of it. That ends your turn, Percival? Tova, what are you doing? You're currently still up on the table, sitting up. You have the greatsword at your side and you watch as the-- one of them, one of the new people stumbles onto the ground and then slashes at this creature a couple times, and it's right there kind of still trying to find its way out.
What're you doing?
-NOELLE-
Gonna grab this cool new greatsword that I have, stand up on the table, and just jump at this guy's head, and swing at it with my cool new greatsword.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-MATT-
All right, so as you leap in the air, bringing it down, go ahead and make both attacks.
First one. This would be a plus ten because it's not magical, I believe, right.
-NOELLE-
Okay.
That's a 13 and a 17 to hit?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Unfortunately, neither hit. The one--
-NOELLE-
Been tied to a table for a while.
-MATT-
Yeah. The first one, it hits the front of its armor and just scrapes off the side. The other one, you swing back and it slams into the stonework, and it just ducks underneath. Bonus action, anything you want to do?
-NOELLE-
Yes.
-MATT-
Before it tries to run away?
-NOELLE-
I want to turn into a bear.
-ALL-
What?
-LAURA-
Oh my god!
-SAM-
Double bear action!
-LAURA-
(sings) Tova's my favorite person in the whole universe.
-MATT-
You watch now, you see the clothing that was on her before wasn't torn from torture, but her form rages into this bipedal humanoid bear with rippling muscles, the same scars across the face, and begins to just growl as the greatsword now looks almost small in comparison in this mighty kind of humanoid bear's grasp.
-MARISHA-
What?
-LIAM-
Ah, she Beorn-ed it!
-MATT-
That's the end of your turn.
-NOELLE-
I'm just wearing sexy bear clothes now.
-LAURA-
It's like a bra, like a little bikini.
-TRAVIS-
Awesome.
-MATT-
All right, the devil-creature is going to go ahead and turn around--
-MARISHA-
Sort of like an 80s fantasy novel cover.
-MATT-
-- and attempt to move this way to the door.
-TALIESIN-
Do I get an attack of opportunity?
-MATT-
Both of you guys get an attack of opportunity as it rushes away.
-LAURA-
Oh, no, it's getting away?
-MARISHA-
No! Kill it.
-LAURA-
We've gotta stop it, we've gotta stop it.
-LIAM-
Damn it.
-TALIESIN-
Disadvantage or no?
-MATT-
Yes, 'cause you're still prone.
-MARISHA-
Come on, Percy. Oh, son of a bitch!
-NOELLE-
24.
-MATT-
That hits, go ahead and roll damage. That's 2d6 for the damage on the greatsword.
-NOELLE-
Okay, 2d-- Oh, sorry. Rusty at this.
-MATT-
It'd be plus six. Because your strength is five and plus one there for the weapon.
-NOELLE-
That is 2d6 plus one?
-MATT-
Plus six total.
-NOELLE-
Okay, so that is 13.
-MATT-
Okay, and if you ever roll a one on the dice, or a one or a two, you can re-roll it once.
-TALIESIN-
Point of random order before he runs--
-NOELLE-
I can re-roll it twice?
-MATT-
You can roll each one once, like if it gets under that. It's part of your Great Weapon Master.
-TALIESIN-
Random point of order, isn't this a surprise round?
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Damn it.
-SAM-
They noticed us.
-TALIESIN-
He noticed us, okay, never mind.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-NOELLE-
Well, I rolled another one, so it's the same, it's 13.
-MATT-
So 13 points of damage. All righty. So you hack at it as it's running away, but it still manages to go-- get out over this side. It goes to the next door and throws it open.
-LAURA-
No!
-MARISHA-
What's in it?
-MATT-
Okay, you guys still can't quite see what's in that chamber beyond from your perspective. And is going to move in. It just gets about that far into the chamber. All right. That gets us to Vax's turn.
-LIAM-
Shit, and he's out of sight now?
-MATT-
He's just moved-- He's out of sight of you, currently, because you're over here.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
Yeah. You don't see him.
-LIAM-
All right. I'm gonna-- I can't really see from where I'm at, so I want to move more in line with the door and see if I can see him if I run over in line.
-MATT-
You can. If you run to where the doorway is open, you can see him as he's just disappearing into a darkened chamber beyond.
-LIAM-
Dagger, dagger.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TALIESIN-
End this.
-MARISHA-
End this.
-LIAM-
First one is-- balls, is 17.
-MATT-
Misses.
-LIAM-
Second one is a 29.
-MATT-
29 hits.
-LIAM-
Nyeh. Fuck a duck. There's two plus-- that is just two, but it's the poison dagger, so I'm gonna unload venom in him.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
DC 15.
-MATT-
That is a 12, no.
-LIAM-
Okay. So he takes-- that's the wrong die.
He-- ah! Oh, it's going as far as it possibly can.
That is 19. Yeah. Ten and a nine.
-MATT-
Okay, got you. Cool. All right, so, the dagger (impact sound) and you see him stumble for a moment as his wings kind of instinctually curl up from the sudden burst of poison in his system.
So.
-LIAM-
That's it, I'm out, I'm done.
-MATT-
You do have some more movement if you wanted to.
-LIAM-
No, I don't, I want to stay where I am.
-LAURA-
Back out of the way of the door.
-MATT-
Okay, so you're going to stay in the doorway?
-LAURA-
Well, you can move out of the way of the doorway so that other people can shoot at him better, maybe, in line of sight. Just move out of the doorway!
-LIAM-
Nope. Nope!
-MATT-
That brings us to Vex's turn! Vex, your turn.
-LAURA-
Thanks for blocking my fucking shot!
-LIAM-
I'm across the country, man, I can't really see.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's all good. I mean, he's not-- He's staying low, and your brother knows not to block the whole path, so--
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
All right--
-LIAM-
I'm always doing squats, man.
-LAURA-
Well then-- I'm going to shoot him.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
Your brother?
-LAURA-
No! I'm going to shoot the dude, the red guy. I'm going to shoot him-- Yeah, I'm going to shoot him.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-LAURA-
Okay, the first one is a 20.
-MATT-
20 hits.
-LAURA-
(silly voice) Okay. 11-- Fucking shit. 11 plus four lightning damage and then-- Ugh! I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him, motherfucker, because I forgot to do it.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Because I'm a fucking asshole!
-TRAVIS-
Wow. Wow, that's like six in one--
-LAURA-
And the second one definitely hits him, too.
-TRAVIS-
I'm keeping count.
-LIAM-
You got to love yourself.
-LAURA-
(affected accent) So then I am going to-- (normal voice) Where's my damn eights? Okay, here they are. God damn it! Nine, ten, 11--
-MARISHA-
It's okay, we love you!
-LAURA-
11 plus one lightning damage, because I suck!
-MARISHA-
No.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
And then four for Hunter's Mark.
-MATT-
All righty.
-MARISHA-
You're an amazing person.
-MATT-
So, both arrows (impact sound). It tumbles forward, kind of like falls to one knee for a second, and is still picking up and running. So that finishes your turn.
-TRAVIS-
That was nine swears in one turn, that was good.
-LAURA-
Was it? Sorry.
-MATT-
That brings us to Grog.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, really? (yells)
-MARISHA-
Kill him!
-TRAVIS-
(yells)
-MARISHA-
Kill him! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
I do a burpee off the floor.
-MATT-
(laughs) Easy enough for you.
-TRAVIS-
I take off running through the doorway!
-MATT-
Five, ten, 15-- 30, 35, 40, 45, 50-- You can just get within melee range-- (cheering)
-LAURA-
Kill him, Grog!
-MATT-
-- because crazy barbarian speed. You also reveal the rest of the chamber--
-LAURA-
Please don't be any more people in there! Shit.
-MATT-
You see two of the-- This chamber contains a bunch of--
-LAURA-
Oh, god.
-MATT-
A bunch of, looks like cells of some kind, that are locked off with doors, and two of the lemures, the weird fleshy tortured spirit things kind of lie in the corner that all of a sudden see you as you charge in and just pay attention to your appearance. So, what are you going to do?
-TRAVIS-
I see him, and I say: hi. And I rage.
-MATT-
Okay. Is this your bonus action?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. And I'm going to hit him twice!
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Go for it.
-TRAVIS-
Reckless, please.
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
That is--
-LAURA-
(Grog voice) That is death!
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) 24.
-MATT-
That hits.
-TRAVIS-
Nice. Nine-- Wait, there it is. 21.
-MATT-
21 points of damage?
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
And the second one. Reckless. Thank god.
Because that was a one. 20-- 31.
-MATT-
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
-TRAVIS-
Jesus-- 11-- 23. 23 points of damage.
-MATT-
Okay. As you rush forward, slam once into the back of his shoulder, he kind of falls to one knee again, still wounded by the slashing to his thighs and the arrows out of his back. The wings kind of unfurl a bit, and he turns around, looking like he's about to point his finger towards you--
-TRAVIS-
Nope.
-MATT-
-- there's like a flash in the eye, like it's attempting to have some sort of type of-- but before it does, you bring the hammer down onto his face. Whack! And as it does, it just caves inward, and falls to the ground, unmoving.
-MARISHA-
That was hot.
-TALIESIN-
(whispers) Drag him back in here.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Metal Gear Solid this shit.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, I don't have anything else to do. That was it-- my bonus action already.
-TALIESIN-
That may be the end of the--
-MATT-
That brings us to Taryon's turn.
-TALIESIN-
Oh! Nope, not.
-SAM-
I will cast Haste on myself.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
And I will then start moving. Where am I?
-MATT-
You're right here.
-SAM-
I'm going to go-- I guess the direction Grog went?
-MATT-
All right. So that's five, ten, 15, 20--
-TRAVIS-
Following your partner.
-MATT-
30, 35, 40. You get all the way into this room, you still have 20 feet of movement left, as you enter next to Grog and see two of the fleshy masses of tortured souls kind of starting to make their way in the direction of you and Grog.
-SAM-
What do I have left?
-MATT-
You have your bonus action, that's it.
Because you cast Haste, and then did your movement.
-SAM-
Sure. I'll just pull out my rod, grip it hard, choke down on it, maybe grip it with my left hand so it feels different-- (laughter)
-MATT-
Very well.
-SAM-
And I'll say, lance! And I'll just use the rest of my movement to just charge at somebody.
-MATT-
You run up towards one of these creatures, and as you get closer, as you see it becomes more and more apparent in your vision, the more horrifying it gets as you get closer. What's Doty going to do?
-SAM-
As I took off I just said, "Doty, on me!" So he's coming.
-MATT-
Doty's movement is--
-SAM-
40.
-TRAVIS-
I like "on me" better than "roll out!"
-MARISHA-
Hey! Hey. Really?
-MATT-
Doty has to spend half of-- it's difficult to get through the doorway-- and gets about that far. Doty actually pushes Vax out of the way, it has to bend down and get into this central chamber. Doty can use the rest of the movement to get into the room with you. Doty can get right there, and that's all Doty can do this turn. All righty, that brings us to Keyleth's turn.
-MARISHA-
That's what cool people say. My turn.
Guy's dead, right? That Grog was after?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
It is hell.
-MARISHA-
It is hell.
-TALIESIN-
Can Grog not see to the right of him yet?
-MATT-
Grog can see both of these things here. You mean can Taryon see this way, you mean?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Taryon can just barely begin to see a hallway that goes further that way.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
That's not a devil demony guy behind Grog.
-MATT-
Over here, you mean?
-MARISHA-
You almost touched it, sorry.
-MATT-
You don't see anything in there, there's nothing in your room right now.
-MARISHA-
What's that?
-MATT-
What's this here?
-MARISHA-
That.
-MATT-
That's Doty.
-MARISHA-
That.
-MATT-
That is Grog.
-MARISHA-
Oh, okay. Okay. And I don't see anything.
-MATT-
You don't see anything in the chamber, everyone's just kind of-- Your new friend turned into a bear, and everyone ran through a door.
-MARISHA-
Tova! Tova! You're really awesome! Are you also a druid? No?
-NOELLE-
I actually can talk, I just don't feel like it.
-MARISHA-
It's been a long day.
-MATT-
That's even better. All right.
-MARISHA-
I move and I peek my head through the door.
-MATT-
You can just get into this chamber with your movement.
-MARISHA-
Grog! What's going on?! You're okay? All right.
-TALIESIN-
You know we have ear pieces, we can just talk to each other, you are aware?
-MARISHA-
Grog! I don't know what to fucking do right now!
-TRAVIS-
I smushed his head.
-TALIESIN-
Bring him back in.
-MARISHA-
Bring him back in! Okay! I can't move any more, though.
-MATT-
You can if you used your action, but that's all you'd be able to do this turn.
-SAM-
I am screaming and running at one of them.
-MATT-
Yeah, not very stealthily or manly
-SAM-
Element of surprise.
-MARISHA-
Okay. You know, there's not a lot I can do right now, so I'm going to say, Grog! Grog! You got this shit! You got it! And I'm going to cast Enhance Ability, and I'm going to give him enhanced strength.
-MATT-
So any strength checks you make are with advantage. Though you already have that while raging.
-MARISHA-
Oh wait, what?
-MATT-
When he rages he gets advantage on his strength checks.
-LAURA-
Make him smarter!
-TRAVIS-
Smarter, handsomer, more stealthy--
-MARISHA-
Can I make him smarter? Or more stealthy? I'm going to give him enhanced dex.
-MATT-
Okay, Cat's Grace. So you have advantage on any stealth checks you make.
-TRAVIS-
Cool.
-MATT-
All righty, that ends Keyleth's turn. Back to the top of the round. Percival.
-MARISHA-
You already have advantage on that too?
-MATT-
You get up, that's half your movement.
-TALIESIN-
What's to my right?
-MATT-
To your right, there is a hallway and then a doorway.
-TALIESIN-
A hallway and a doorway?
-MATT-
Yeah. Right there.
-TALIESIN-
You know, I don't think I'm very useful for what they're doing right now, so I'm just going to do a little bit of a poke around over there to see what's happening and listen.
What am I going to do, shoot a gun right now?
-SAM-
"I invoke the second pact!"
-TALIESIN-
You can't do that. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. Those cages are empty?
-MATT-
These cages are empty, currently, yes.
-TALIESIN-
And that chest is closed?
-MATT-
Which one?
-TALIESIN-
That one.
-MATT-
This one is currently closed.
-TALIESIN-
I look around. I'm going to run through into that smaller room, on the other side.
-MATT-
That's as far as you can get right there.
-TALIESIN-
I crawl up on the wall, because I can, and watch in horror.
-MATT-
All righty, that ends your turn, Percival.
Tova.
-NOELLE-
I have a question for you real quick.
-MATT-
Yes.
-NOELLE-
I have the words, "Reroll is +25 on weapon" written on here, under Great Weapon Fighting, what does that mean?
-MATT-
That means, if you want to, on an attack, you can take minus five to hit to add ten to damage.
-NOELLE-
Okay, cool.
-TRAVIS-
It's a gamble.
-MATT-
That's Great Weapon Master. And then you have Great Weapon Fighting, you can reroll any ones or twos that you roll for damage.
-NOELLE-
Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh yeah, that's what it says, it says, "Reroll ones and twos," not "Reroll is +25." That is confusing handwriting from me. My bad. I'm just going to charge in as a bear, and in the dark, I can go ten more feet?
-MATT-
Yeah, because it's low light.
-NOELLE-
So I can go 45 feet? I assume they haven't gone that far. Can I catch up with them?
-SAM-
Farther in the dark?
-MATT-
You rush in. The one that was initially left is slaughtered on the ground, but as you rush past, stepping over its corpse, you see another fleshy mass lemure, the creatures that have been following you around since you got here.
-NOELLE-
That's the one I'm running at, yeah?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-NOELLE-
I want to kill it.
-MATT-
Go for it, roll for an attack.
-NOELLE-
I'm going to do that. Wait, so I'm a bear now, so I get the Transform added to my weapon, yeah?
-MATT-
Correct, you do. It's an additional plus two.
-NOELLE-
That's 30.
-MATT-
That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
-NOELLE-
All right. Aw yeah. Two sixes, and that is plus nine, so that is 21.
-MATT-
21 points of damage. As you rush forward, you come down with the greatsword and slice right to the center of this cluster of flesh. It's just (burbling) and falls to the ground, sloughing in two pieces, quivering, and then disperses.
-NOELLE-
Do I have a bonus action?
-MATT-
You do have a bonus action, yeah.
-NOELLE-
I just want to spit on it. I hate that guy. It's my least favorite one.
-MATT-
A big old thick bear loogie onto the corpse as it slowly turns into a liquid. It steams as it falls into the cracks and crevices of the stone floor. All right.
-NOELLE-
Bye, motherfucker.
-MATT-
That's Tova's turn, that guy's gone. This lemure, 15 foot of movement, another one comes up behind you but it has to use all of its action to get to you. These creatures are not very dangerous if you're far away. As that shambles forward, another winged creature turns the corner, inspecting the sound, and as it turns the corner and sees you, Taryon, shouting as you ran forward with the spear, and the creature, right as you're about to attack, gets slashed in half in front of you, robbing you of your glory, you turn the corner and see another winged humanoid, this one female, with a very intense scowl on its face. You can see the fanged teeth out of its mouth, and points towards you. I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, with advantage.
-SAM-
18.
-MATT-
18, okay. You feel an influence begin to press into your brain, drawing you into a strange brain space, and you clench your eyes and force it out, your will strong enough to resist the effect.
Upon seeing this fail, and your vision go clear, it glances about and sees everyone else charging into the room, and then backs up again into the chamber this way, that far with the rest of their movement, and that's as far as they get.
-MARISHA-
I feel like we're alerting the whole god damned house.
-TALIESIN-
We gotta eventually get a candle on this.
-MARISHA-
A handle, or a candle?
-TALIESIN-
A handle and a candle.
-MATT-
That brings us to Vax.
-LIAM-
All right, I can't see too well from here, so, from where I am, crashed in front of my sister, do I see the lemure?
-MATT-
You do.
-LIAM-
All right. And am I within 60 feet?
-MATT-
You are indeed.
-LIAM-
I'm going to chuck Whisper at it.
-MATT-
All right. I will say, if you don't move, Grog is blocking a large portion of this space so I'll give you disadvantage on the attack even though the creature's very easy to see.
-LIAM-
I'm Sharpshooter, so only full cover affects my attacks.
-MATT-
Fair enough. So, go ahead, you're unaffected.
-LIAM-
I got a 22.
-MATT-
22? It hits. Go and roll damage.
-LIAM-
Okay, and I'm going to bamf there on this, and Grog is right up against it?
-MATT-
Yes. Oh, Grog is not, Grog is about ten feet away from it.
-LIAM-
Is anybody right next to it?
-MATT-
Tova's right next to it.
-LIAM-
All right, so that's Sneak Attack damage. So that is four plus eight is 12, plus psychic damage, that's 19, plus the Sneak Attack damage is 22, 26, 27, 32, 37, 40, 44 total.
-MATT-
Okay. You eviscerate the lemure. You watch as you jam your dagger through it multiple times, and each section you carve off of it, it splits open, leaving these stringy tendrils of flesh and tendon behind as it wails and shrieks to the ground, slowly dissipating into a thick sludge.
-LIAM-
For my new vantage point, do I see the winged creature that you had referenced?
-MATT-
Make a perception check. As you make a glance around the room.
-LIAM-
That is 24.
-MATT-
24? You unfortunately do not.
-LIAM-
All right. I am going to use my bonus action to hide if I can. I should have full movement. Can I back into a corner of the room?
-MATT-
You do, yes you can. You can back into that corner here, and go ahead and roll your stealth.
-LIAM-
Sure. That's a 40.
-MATT-
Okay. Well, you don't get the plus ten.
-LIAM-
Oh, 30.
-MATT-
Because you already cast Hunter's Mark, which got rid of Pass Without a Trace. So, 30. But good to know. Vex, you're up.
-LAURA-
All right. I come running forward, and as I'm running forward I bamf Trinket out of the necklace.
-MATT-
That's as far as you can get there, and then Trinket emerges in the chamber next to Grog, goes over and is right next to the destroyed corpse of the devil humanoid earlier, the face smashed in.
-TRAVIS-
Eat it.
-LAURA-
Can I say, are we in the clear? Is everyone safe?
-MATT-
Guys, you all hear Vex say that.
-TRAVIS-
No, there's one running.
-LAURA-
Trinket, go after it! Which way did it go?
-TRAVIS-
Down the hallway to the right. Left.
Direction.
-TALIESIN-
That was helpful. That was two out of four possible answers.
-MATT-
Trinket does manage to just catch up with it.
-LAURA-
Oh shit, he's going to try to attack it.
Can he do that?
-MATT-
Yeah, he can.
-LAURA-
All right. Fuck, he's going to jump on it.
-SAM-
Double bear action. Bear on bear action.
-TALIESIN-
Really don't Google that.
-SAM-
Two bears wrestling with each other.
-LAURA-
28.
-MATT-
28 hits. Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.
-TRAVIS-
That's a really good roll for Trinket.
-LAURA-
I know!
-MATT-
Are you using your action to give him a double attack?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay. Because you're not actually attacking anything. So go for it. So it's two attacks. So the first one's damage?
-LAURA-
Okay, first one's damage would be 14.
-MATT-
14, all righty.
-LAURA-
And the second one is 26.
-MATT-
26 hits.
-LAURA-
And that's-- eight plus nine is 17.
-MATT-
17, there you go. So look at that. So Trinket rushes in with a double swipe. As soon as the creature backs around the corner, and it goes to turn, Trinket comes rushing around the corner and tears into it with a claw and a bite into this female devil who is pushed into the wall and torn into the chest terribly. You guys just see and hear this in the distance, you don't actually watch the impact happen, but you hear the screaming and Trinket roaring as it strikes into it.
-LAURA-
Shit. Well, that's loud. Hey buddy, try to stay quiet!
-MATT-
You get the sense that it's going to be real hard to try to maintain a sense of stealth in this stronghold now. So that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
I run after--
-LAURA-
I use my bonus action to hide as well.
-MATT-
Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
-LAURA-
Unless letting Trinket out of the necklace, does that count as my bonus action?
-MATT-
Actually, I'd probably say it's a bonus action, yeah. Grog.
-TRAVIS-
I run after winged she-bitch.
-MATT-
Not an issue. You get up there right with Trinket, we'll say for the purposes of this tiny alley, you're in an uncomfortably close, due to your both massive sizes, you have to move to the side around Trinket and come down with the hammer if you want.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah. Two, please. Reckless! 33.
-MATT-
That hits.
-TRAVIS-
Okay. Oh, I reroll that, because that's a one. That's a two. 18. 18 points.
-MATT-
18 points of damage, all righty.
-TRAVIS-
Reckless. 36.
-MATT-
That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
-TRAVIS-
23 points of damage.
-MATT-
All righty. As you slam into it multiple times, the hammer reaching around the side of Trinket, it's being pushed against the wall and you can see she has this giant slash mark on the chest, a big part of the neck has been torn out, and you start bludgeoning her on the side of the shoulder, and she's (growling noises) is really, really frustrated. That ends your turn, Grog.
Taryon, you're up.
-SAM-
Oh, is that thing still alive, that Grog is fighting around the corner?
-MATT-
It is.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Your turn, buddy, come on. Show me what you got.
-LAURA-
Keep it from getting away!
-SAM-
Yeah, I'm good at that. I will run around the corner.
-MATT-
As soon as you run around the corner, you see this mass of fur that is Trinket, this mass of muscle that is Grog, and this tiny little bit of a devilish head of this female, as you're holding your pike.
-SAM-
Do I have more movement? No, right?
-MATT-
You do have a little more movement, yeah.
-SAM-
All right, can I get up to poke it?
-MATT-
Because it is a reach weapon, you can. Over Trinket. Go ahead and roll an attack.
-SAM-
Would it take my bonus action to say, fire, and light my weapon on fire?
-MATT-
Yes, you can do that.
-SAM-
I'm lighting my weapon on fire and poking it!
-MATT-
The front of it bursts into flame, and you appear on the side. So go and roll an attack.
-SAM-
Yes, I know how to do this! Attack plus eight, so that's 21.
-MATT-
21 hits!
-SAM-
It's 1d12, ooh, four! Plus two magic, so that's six! Plus 1d6! Is four! Ten!
-MATT-
Ten? All right. The fire's reduced by half, so it's eight. Eight points of damage.
-SAM-
I'm hasted, I get another attack!
-MATT-
You do.
-SAM-
Poke again! (laughter)
18.
-MATT-
18 unfortunately does not hit.
-SAM-
I feel lucky. 24.
-MATT-
That hits!
-SAM-
Ooh, ten! Ten plus two, that's 12, plus six!
-MATT-
15, because fire, half the fire damage. As you jam it over Trinket, the second one gets it in the throat.
-LAURA-
Be dead, be dead.
-TALIESIN-
Shh, go to sleep, go to sleep.
-MATT-
That'll do it! You poke, and as the lance slinks into the side of her throat, which is the only thing you can really see at this point over Trinket, she grabs up and instinctually catches the lance. As you're pushing it in, and you shove it in, going "Ahh!" It's like a slow Saving Private Ryan knife push. She's like (gurgling noise) and just falls limp on the edge of the lance, crumples to the ground.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, nice job.
-LAURA-
Wow. Can we be quiet now?
-TRAVIS-
You should open your eyes, though.
-SAM-
Doty, take this down. I am the vanquisher of souls.
-MATT-
Doty immediately pulls the small chamber in the side of the torso that holds the book and--
-SAM-
And then I throw up.
-MATT-
All right, that ends Taryon's turn.
Keyleth.
-MARISHA-
Okay. I am going to back myself up in this corner that I'm in, and I'm going to cast Locate Creature.
-MATT-
Okay. What's the casting time on Locate Creature?
-MARISHA-
Who's got the book?
-MATT-
Locate Creature? Okay, it's one action, you can do it.
-MARISHA-
One action! It's one action, because I knew that. And I'm going to cast, and I'm going to say, Utugash.
-MATT-
Okay. You immediately sense a very large heavy source of energy right in the center of this chamber here.
-MARISHA-
(whispers) He's in the next room. He's in the next room! Be quiet! Jesus, be quiet!
-SAM-
Who is?
-MARISHA-
Utugash!
-LAURA-
I wonder if he knows that we're here.
-MARISHA-
I look at Grog. Grog!
-TRAVIS-
Run in like a bull and fart on the wind? Cut the throat? Bull? Flapping wings? Earache?
-MARISHA-
Utugash. Utugash! Grog! By that wall!
-TRAVIS-
Pokey poke.
-LAURA-
Why don't you just use your fucking earring?
-MARISHA-
I'm trying, he still doesn't understand words!
-TRAVIS-
I can hear you whispering. I don't know why you--
-MARISHA-
He's on the other side of the wall! Utugash!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, he's on the other side of the wall.
-LAURA-
He's in the next fucking room.
-TRAVIS-
Oh. Why didn't you just say that?
-MARISHA-
Because I was trying to be--
-TRAVIS-
What's this Tutonka thing you're doing? I don't understand.
-MARISHA-
I was trying to be stealthy!
-TALIESIN-
Oh, Tutonka! I know Tutonka.
-MATT-
You hear a very, very faint sound of shifting stone. It's very faint. That's it.
-MARISHA-
Shift of stones? What?
-LAURA-
We should go in the room. We should get in now before he gets away.
-SAM-
We need to go in that room?
-MARISHA-
Do you guys want to flank? I think we can flank. Looks like there's an entrance on either side.
-TALIESIN-
Are we still in combat mode right now?
-MATT-
Currently there is no immediate threat, so you guys can take a moment if you feel like you need to.
-LAURA-
No, let's run up and get in that fucking room.
-LIAM-
Is there anything anyone wants to do before we go in? Last second, real quick?
-TALIESIN-
I want to check out what's still covered by dark, very gently.
-MATT-
Which one?
-SAM-
The corner covered by the diagonal piece of paper. Closest to me.
-MATT-
Over there? Okay.
-NOELLE-
Would I know anything about the layout of these rooms, or just my room?
-MATT-
Just your room, that's all you're really aware of. So as you look over in that corner, you can see it's this series of five locked cell doors. Some of them have small bars in the window, some of them are just solid doors, but they're all slammed and locked.
-LIAM-
Meantime, our friend is sealed off behind a closed door?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we heard some stone moving, so I think he's trying to get away.
-MARISHA-
He's in this room.
-LIAM-
There's a shut door between us and this guy?
-MATT-
You don't know.
-LIAM-
I'm going to creep along towards our friend there.
-LAURA-
I come in, too.
-MATT-
Okay. All right. Keyleth, are you doing anything else?
-MARISHA-
Can I take this opportunity to do a quick Inspiring Leader speech?
-MATT-
It takes ten minutes to do that, sorry.
-MARISHA-
Then no, I'm not going to do that, I'm going to flank around this side a bit. Other side.
-SAM-
"Four score and-- never mind."
-MARISHA-
There might be a door over there, right? Two doors? Is there a door on that side?
-SAM-
Are we trying to get in this room? Why don't I just make a way in?
-LAURA-
I think there's a door right in front of us, but yeah, we can come in the sides.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, if we can flank him, that'd be great!
-LAURA-
I'm going to follow Taryon.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, I follow.
-SAM-
I'm going to keep walking down that hall, where we just were.
-MARISHA-
I follow Tary as well.
-MATT-
Is Tary leading the charge here?
-SAM-
As always.
-MARISHA-
Are we splitting up? Anyone going through the door?
-LAURA-
No, I'm following fucking Tary.
-MATT-
All right, so you're following Tary, everyone's moving over to the hallway here, then.
-LAURA-
Because this is smart.
-MATT-
Doty is pushing forward this way, Tova are you following?
-NOELLE-
Yep.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
I'm staying at the back.
-MATT-
Staying back?
-LIAM-
DM, I have no sense of where I am, because of New Jersey. Where am I on that map?
-SAM-
You're in the back of the pack.
-MATT-
You're the back of the pack-- well, middle of the pack right now.
-LIAM-
Oh, I meant to sneak ahead.
-MARISHA-
Can maybe Tary gives us one entrance and then we use the actual entrance as well--
-TRAVIS-
Can I keep going, down the hallway?
-MARISHA-
-- so we're all not going into one entrance? Flank a motherfucker?
-MATT-
Well, first and foremost--
-TALIESIN-
I didn't have a chance to peek inside any of those doors, did I? Peek in through the window of any of those doors, did I?
-MATT-
Not before you all started moving forward.
You can if you want to, but you'll stay behind everyone for a little bit.
-LIAM-
Over the earring: If he knows we're here, then all bets are off, but if he doesn't know we're here, I'm going to be able to lay a massive amount of hurt on him.
-LAURA-
I think he knows we're here.
-TRAVIS-
Tary was screaming like a woman.
-SAM-
I-- There's nothing wrong with that.
-LIAM-
What if?
-LAURA-
Number one, there isn't.
-SAM-
Women are powerful, and amazing.
-LAURA-
That's right.
-TRAVIS-
It was just very high-pitched, is what I mean.
-LAURA-
Right, and there's nothing wrong with that.
-TRAVIS-
Except it gives away our position in this endeavour.
-SAM-
But did you see? I slew that-- slew? Slayed? Is slew a past tense of slay?
-TALIESIN-
Slew.
-NOELLE-
Do I have any way of knowing if this is Utugash in the next room? Can I do a wisdom check with my bear smell?
-MATT-
Yeah, make a perception check, with advantage because of your keen senses.
-SAM-
Bear smell!
-NOELLE-
Take that first one. Okay--
-SAM-
As Tova does this, I turn to her--
-NOELLE-
20.
-SAM-
-- and I say, you won't pee on me will you? I've already been marked.
-TALIESIN-
Peed on before.
-NOELLE-
Why would you ask that? What kind of stuff do you guys do?
-SAM-
I ask that of everyone I meet.
-NOELLE-
Who are you people?
-MATT-
So what did you roll for your check?
-NOELLE-
20.
-MATT-
20. (sniffs) You are familiar with this smell, Utugash. It is a combined smell of sulfur, a dry earth, and grotesque decomposition. And the smell is very strong, and you can already follow the scent, it does lead into this next chamber, which is just an open wall.
It isn't a door that's closed--
-SAM-
There's no door? It's just open?
-MATT-
There's no door, it's just an open wall that leads into a chamber.
-NOELLE-
I want to kill that guy so bad.
-MATT-
Taryon, you're leading the charge, you said?
-LAURA-
I feel like Tary, you should make a door on the other side and then we go inside.
-SAM-
On the other side? We were there already.
-LAURA-
Right, I mean where Doty is standing right now, if you made a door right there.
-SAM-
Why would that give us any advantage? I'm making a door five feet away from the other door?
-LAURA-
No, that door's around where Doty is standing, is around the corner.
-TRAVIS-
Since I'm the closest, can I step up into the doorway and see what I see?
-MATT-
Yeah, so you step up and move. As you do, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
-MARISHA-
This could be door number two over here.
-SAM-
I see.
-MARISHA-
That way we're all not crowding through one door.
-LAURA-
Well, Grog's going into the room right now.
-TRAVIS-
19.
-MATT-
19. As you step forward, something beneath your foot (click), and you look up just as you-- as a piece of a circular stone opening that you previously didn't see before, suddenly pours a heavy amount of extremely hot, boiling oil down above you, and you step back, just out of the way as it splatters across the ground, sizzling there.
-LAURA-
Oh my god. Dexterity.
-MARISHA-
Do you have advantage on that? Because of my thing?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah! I had advantage already, but that's cool.
-MARISHA-
Okay. (laughs)
-MATT-
Yeah, he doesn't get saving throws, he gets skills from you, but he has advantage on saving throws from traps.
-MARISHA-
Still cool.
-TRAVIS-
Do I see anything through the doorway, from where I'm standing?
-MATT-
You step forward, make a perception check.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, this'll be good. Oh! Hey, 18!
-MATT-
All right, as you turn around the corner and look in, the interior is very low-lit.
-TRAVIS-
I do have Darkvision.
-MATT-
What little bit of light-- I know you have Darkvision, but there is-- what little bit of light you see is two sources of very, very low, deep, red light. These two giant pools of some thick red liquid that are just emanating this very, very faint glow. Inside you see there is a giant chair that is affixed into the center of the chamber, as well as an altar in the center.
Upon this chair, you see, similar to what you battled in the City of Brass, you see a massive pit fiend, the wings lazily uncurled to each side, the corpulent mass of it is just this giant belly that hangs over the front of its knees. It clutches to its side, and it's using currently to keep one of its arms propped up, is a large axe, and the other hand is just resting on the side of the throne, and you see it just sitting there, tapping its fingers, looking straight at you as you enter-- as you step into the middle of the hallway.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh, it's like an invitation.
-MATT-
There are a series of-- clusters of bones throughout the entire room.
-LAURA-
Oh my lord!
-TALIESIN-
It looks like a happy little robot from up top.
-TRAVIS-
Now that I see him, can I look to my left, down the rest of the hallway?
-MATT-
You can, and it leads to what looks to be a portcullis gate, an iron gate of cross bars that has-- is closed currently yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Cool cool.
-TRAVIS-
A-fucking Jenga.
(laughter)
And I will scoot to my left inside the doorway but still stay in cover behind the wall.
No, no, to the left of the doorway but still in the hallway.
-MATT-
I will say, it's 10:45. Do we want to pick up at this battle moment at the beginning of next week?
-LAURA-
All right, all right.
-SAM-
If Noelle is available.
-NOELLE-
I don't know, are you going to leave me tied to a table?
-SAM-
No! (laughter)
You'll start with us!
-MARISHA-
We could've found you in a magical shop.
-TRAVIS-
Nope.
-MARISHA-
We could've found you in a prison.
-TALIESIN-
Could've been drinking in a bar, like a normal person, but no, tied to a chair.
-NOELLE-
Just an extra night of torture, it's no big deal.
-TRAVIS-
Just an hour and 40 minutes to sign a contract.
-NOELLE-
Take your time! I'll be around, I want to kill this guy.
-MATT-
All right, so we'll have Noelle back for next week. We'll pick up right at the encounter with Utugash, within his stronghold.
-TALIESIN-
Uragash.
-MATT-
Oh man, this'll be fun.
-MARISHA-
I think I called him U-tu-gash, because that's what I wrote down.
-MATT-
Utugash.
-MARISHA-
Like Uta Hagen, but Utugash.
-MATT-
U-T-U-G-A-S-H.
-MARISHA-
Oh, it is U-T-U, Utugash. Okay.
-MATT-
You did good, you did good. (laughs) But yeah, we'll pick this up next week, jumping into this fray. Thank you guys so much for watching, thank you so much for playing, guys. Thank you Loot Crate for being our awesome sponsor. And we'll see you guys-- we'll be there at Wondercon this Saturday, 2PM.
-LAURA-
Oh, jeez.
-MATT-
Yeah-yeah! Yeah! Two o'clock.
-MARISHA-
Big room.
-MATT-
The arena. All right, folks, have a wonderful night, sleep well and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
-TALIESIN-
Night!
-TRAVIS-
Nice! [music]

Critical Role Campaign 1 Episode 115.12 "The Adventures of the Darrington Brigade"
-BRIAN-
Well-- (laughs) Well-- Christoper, Christopher, Christopher! Well, hell.
Hello, Texas.
Welcome to Critical Role Live.
Holy shit, this is too many people, and I am wearing single layer Depends.
-BRIAN-
Thank you very much, thank you so much, thank you.
Ah, you guys are too nice.
You guys are too nice.
It's wonderful to be in the birthplace of such legends as Lincoln spokesperson, Matthew McConaughey.
[cheering] Fashion icon and rapper, Nelly.
[cheering] And role model and multi Tour De France winner, Lance Armstrong.
[laughter] The big-- doesn't this outfit look like a Guns n' Roses tattoo, by the way? [laughter] I feel like that yodeling kid from Walmart if 30 years later and his parents had stolen all his money and fled to Fiji and this is where he ended up.
Some people know what I'm talking about.
[laughter] Hey, speaking of-- Hey, kid, if you're watching, by the way, don't do drugs, man, this is what happens.
[laughter] And don't borrow too much money from people.
Speaking of borrowing money from people, it's my birthday, as this person was so nice to-- [cheering] Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I look out, I see tons of people holding stacks of cash ready to throw at me. Please don't. Instead for my birthday, in honor of my birthday, I would urge you to please make a donation to OSD.
[cheering] Who is supporting military veterans, active duty and veterans.
So far we've helped over 700 veterans with the money you guys have given, so-- [cheering] We were hanging out earlier with Glen, the CEO and just hearing stories and everything.
Travis and I both come from military families and what they're doing is remarkable.
This country does a shitty job of taking care of people that fucking serve it so it's up to us to take care of them and-- [applause] So please, for my birthday, go to critrole.com.
[cheering] Slash.
OSD and donate.
You guys, this is a good crowd, you guys, I hope you have your shit together.
I hope you have your shit together.
(laughs) All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Onto the bad cop stuff.
So this is being recorded.
There are very expensive, high-quality cameras recording this. No need for you to take out your phone and hold it up, blocking someone's view.
Don't be an iPad person.
You know when you go to a concert and someone's holding up an iPad. It's like, do that at some Dave Matthews Band concert or some shit not when I'm-- shit I'm going to.
I'm going to get a bunch of messages from the Dave Matthews fans. I didn't anticipate pissing them off when I got off the plane yesterday. So that being said, we're also instituting a strict no spoilers policy because this isn't going to air until next Friday night for the rest of the Critters. So please, please, please, don't tweet, Instagram, Facebook, Bumble, Tumble, rumble, fumble.
I don't know, Vinny, what's the rest of them? Ruffle? Mmm, Ruffles have ridges.
[laughter] Couple of meanings there, let's unpack that at the intermission if we have some time.
Yeah, so don't post spoilers.
The other thing is at these live events, shit gets very exciting and emotional.
So you're welcome to cheer and scream and laugh and gasp and hug people next to you if they're okay with it or if you know them. It's important to check first.
I learned that the first time I saw Cher.
Anyway, story for another time. We got a big show.
But what we don't like is when you yell out rules or "You forgot Hunter's Mark," or-- [laughter] - a joke that you think is funny, or "Play Free Bird," if Matt can't find the song's he's looking for on his iPad or anything like that. Try not to disturb the people around you. The people at home are going to watch this in the weeks to come and me most importantly because I'm going to be sitting up there and I brought my blow darts.
[laughter] Last order of business is without further ado.
[cheering] I would like to introduce the cast of Critical Role.
[cheering] Taliesin Jaffe.
[cheering] It's Laura Bailey.
[cheering] Wow, Marisha Ray.
[cheering] Yes, woo.
[cheering] It's Ashley Johnson! [cheering] Liam O'Brien.

-ASHLEY-
Happy birthday, Brian Foster! Yay!
-MATT-
Happy birthday, Brian Foster! [cheering]
Oh man.
Hi, Austin.
[cheering] This is insane,
-MATT-
Thank you, guys. I love you! Thank you guys so much for hosting us for tonight's fantastic Darrington Brigade one-shot.
[cheering] For a few of us, it's their first time in Austin.
[cheering]
-MARISHA-
And I just love your southern hospitality.
[cheering]
-MATT-
Man, that's a lot of smiling faces out there.
It's like a triple decker, this is chaos, I love it.
[cheering] No pressure, we're fine.
We're good.
(laughs) We love you guys. Thank you all for making it out here, those local and those who traveled far and those that traveled really far, thank you so much for joining us tonight.
This is going to be a fun, crazy, silly adventure and I'm excited to throw these guys in the middle of it.
-LIAM-
New character, who dis? [laughter]
-MATT-
We have no announcements, necessarily.
-SAM-
I can make one announcement.
-MATT-
Okay, go for it.
-SAM-
I just-- [cheering] I just wanted to say thank you so much for welcoming us to Texas and in front of you guys as my witness, I want to officially pledge my loyalty.
-TALIESIN-
Nope, don't buy it.
-SAM-
Thank you to the generosity of Travis Frederick and the peer pressure of Travis Willingham.
[laughter] I will pledge my eternal loyalty to the Dallas Cowboys.
[cheering] (laughter) Yep. My new heroes are, and I might be pronouncing these wrong, Tony Ramo, Dede Saunders, and Larry Ellen.
-TRAVIS-
Allen.
-SAM-
Yeah, but go America's team? [cheering]
-TRAVIS-
Only took almost four years to wear him down.
-MATT-
(laughs) Oh man, well, a couple of quick thank yous up front.
We have some awesome miniatures that you'll see throughout the evening that are displayed, a huge thanks to Eldritch Foundry for creating the awesome miniatures for the new members of the Darrington Brigade.
[cheering] As well as a huge thank you to Steamforged, who made our Tary and Doty, who are part of our original miniature Kickstarter.
And a major thank you to @AvivOr for creating the character art for today's show.
They're an amazing artist, if you haven't had a chance, check out their work, I highly recommend it.
And I think, unless we have anything else to say.
(groaning) Let us go ahead and jump into tonight's Darrington Brigade one-shot for Critical Role.

-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
[cheering]
Sure.
-MATT-
This definitely the strangest timeline.
[laughter] So.
-LIAM-
Oh god.
[laughter] (dramatic music)
-MATT-
The year is 826PD, Post Divergence, just over a decade since the events of Vecna's ascension and subsequent banishing by the famed group of legendary heroes, Vox Machina.
[cheering] While the echoes of their deeds slowly settle over the years, life continues on.
Taryon Darrington, a heroic crafter of arcane implements and member of aforementioned Vox Machina, returned to his home in Wildemount, reclaimed the family business and converted their estate into a shelter for the poor of Deastok.
[cheering] Along with the help of his husband, Lawrence.
[cheering] Taryon created the Darrington Brigade, a nonprofit adventuring troupe for hire, seeking to bravely tackle the dangers of Wildemount and help those in need.
They also have three rescue dogs.
[cheering] Even with the release of the first edition of The Daring Trials and Tribulations of Sir Taryon Darrington, the years have not been without their challenges.
Many of the affluent-- whoa, everyone okay over there? [laughter] Many of the affluent folks of the Truscan Vale treat this bold new direction of the Darrington family with ridicule, making support for their charitable endeavors an uphill battle.
While many capable adventurers who join the brigade, began to bristle at the idea of putting their lives at the line for a nonprofit troupe.
[laughter] That said, the supposed arrests of high ranking Myriad leaders and the following dispersing of the criminal organization in the Empire still leaves much mistrust and rumor mongering. Whispers of a growing Xhorhasian threat begin to stoke worry in civilized spaces.
In this wake, the need for mercenaries slowly grows and Taryon has begun putting out flyers across the Marrow Valley seeking new recruits for this Darrington Brigade, promising adventure, glory, and stories to tell, much like those you can find in a copy of his book, The Daring Trials of, Tribulations of Sir Taryon Darrington.
[laughter] Now you, the rest of you have all arrived separately, piecemeal, to the city of Deastok.
A smaller yet quaint, seemingly wealthy borough within the Truscan Vale of the Empire.
You enter past the perimeter walls known as the Jeweled Gates, as the afternoon sun peeks through the cloud dappled sky.
You walk through the bustling Bursar Plaza filled with quaint shops and bistros, beyond the curling parks of the garden grounds, to finally come upon the estate of the Darrington family.
Tall gates surround what might have once been beautifully tended gardens and hedges, now leveled to house the rather cramped training grounds filled with wooden dummies and an open sand pit.
The home itself is a beautiful mansion, although it appears that there's some minor construction on the second floor, the construction appears to be abandoned at the time.
You begin to gather these strange faces at the gates before a loud voice suddenly breaks through, catching your attention, "Tary, we have guests!" You look to see a man's head poking through the door and quickly closes.
You have a moment amongst yourselves, if you'd like to talk for a moment.
[laughter] As they all stare at each other awkwardly in silence.
[laughter] For far too long a period of time.
(laughter) The doors open once more to the front of the estate, there revealing a fully armored Taryon Darrington.
[cheering] Adorned in full regalia, hair perfectly placed and decorations on full display.
If you would like to describe.
-SAM-
Oh! What they see is a living legend.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
Taryon Gary Darrington, a golden man, head to toe, golden hair from genetics, golden armor from money.
His blond hair has a little bit of gray, he's pushing 40 but if you ask him, it's almost his 33rd birthday.
[laughter] Unlike the first time we met Tary, his armor and accoutrements seem a little bit used! There are scuff marks on his helmet, his rod of mercurial form seems scuffed and mended.
He wears a robe of useful things, but most of the patches are gone and have been replaced with commemorative patches that say things like, "kill a dragon," or "transport a treasure," much like the patches you can find on the fourth floor merchandise-- (laughter) - at intermission (click click), check them out.
His face looks a little younger than it should because, side note, a few days ago, he gave some aid to a cattle farmer in exchange for a bovine toxin, which he injected into his forehead and lips to give himself a little bit of a younger appearance.
-TRAVIS-
So stupid.
-SAM-
But in general--
-TRAVIS-
That's so stupid.
-SAM-
In general, he's fabulous.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Artificers get that at 10th level, actually, it's pretty helpful.
Behind him, you see walking a nine-foot humanoid figure made of bright gold, adamantine, and other metals, carrying a book under one arm.
And following up behind that, you see another man in his early 50s quickly catching up.
His shoulder length hair is mostly graying black while he keeps a gray white chin beard.
He quickly rushes up with a set of keys and unlocks the gates to the manor before shouting, "Presenting Sir Taryon Darrington, master of the house and founder of the Darrington Brigade. Welcome." (applause)
-SAM-
You there, you lot, hello, welcome, welcome weary travelers! I am Taryon Darrington, founder, owner, and chief marketing officer of the, thank you, Darrington Brigade, Wildemount's only not for profit mercenary group, if there's a dragon to slay, we slay it, if there's a damsel in distress, we unstress her.
[laughter] Our adventures are known far and wide in my best selling book, copies of which Lawrence will gladly sell you in the gift shop later.
-MATT-
"Yes, we have quite an abundance."
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-SAM-
But you have-- <i>Larry</i>.
But you have come to us, so I assume you know of our exploits already.
I'm more curious about you. Please, introduce yourselves.
[cheering]
-TALIESIN-
(deep, gruff) I guess we're starting with me.
[cheering] You may have heard of my exploits.
They're whispered, whispered in places where evil gather, where monsters and demons try and thwart mankind.
Criminals and monsters, they're superstitious, timid.
And two of the world's greatest predators, the owl and the bear, while frightening, strike nowhere near as much terror as that alliance between them.
I am known as The Owlbear.
[cheering] For reference, you see a man in his late 30s wearing a brown tunic and boots, and an owlbear cowl.
Way too many daggers hanging from a belt and he hasn't shaved in a few days and some big weird claws on his hands.
Yeah, that's right.
-SAM-
You there next to The Owlbear, who are you?
-LAURA-
(light Irish accent) Hello! My name is Farriwen Breeze, I came here from an island in the Lucidian Ocean.
I come from the Monastery of the Eternal Balance and I have left the monastery because, well, I've heard tell of your exploits and I'm in need of some training as far as that is concerned but I'd love to learn more.
I actually didn't know you were for nonprofit.
-SAM-
Oh yes, we should be very clear about this point.
Any treasure, spoils, cursed magical items will be turned right over to the Brigade and then, you know, sold for the benefit of society.
So there will be no profit here.
-LAURA-
What if the reason I wanted the treasure was for good of mankind or maybe just for the good of maybe my mankind?
-SAM-
I'm sorry, I don't make the rules.
-MARISHA-
(brassy, old time radio announcer) How do you feel about licensing and copyright agreements?
-SAM-
Oh, you seem brassy.
[laughter] I'm interested in that, but more about--
-MARISHA-
We'll put a pin in that.
-SAM-
Yeah, more about you Farriwen.
Anything else we should know about you?
-LAURA-
Well.
Out of character. What you see before you is a woman with very, very pale, almost alabaster skin that seems to glow from underneath. She's got very pale pink hair that if you stare at it, looks like it's blowing a bit in the breeze and she's wearing a dress that is gray with faded colors from the bottom up, including all the colors of flame and wind and all of that fabulousness and then her arms-- (chuckles) On one arm are these almost glyphs that resemble flames licking up her arm, so it looks like they glow from underneath like an opal almost, and then on the other side, it echoes clouds blowing in the breeze.
Yes.
-SAM-
That's some amazing ink you've got there.
-LAURA-
Oh it isn't ink.
-SAM-
You were born with that?
-LAURA-
No, it's more like engravings.
-SAM-
Oh! So you're into bod mod? [laughter] Cool, yeah cool, awesome.
And you, pushy lady.
-MARISHA-
Oh yes! (tambourine jingling)
-LAURA-
Oh wow.
-SAM-
Oh, there's music coming from you.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
You see a dwarven woman with basically a one man band set up.
[cheering] Entirely.
[cheering] [laughter] She has a giant drum on her back and with stirrups that go around her shins, so every time she walks, you hear a-- (tambourine jingling) [laughter] Hello.
(ascending glockenspiel arpeggiated chord) [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Holy shit.
-SAM-
Well!
-MARISHA-
Allow me to introduce myself, if you don't mind if I make an introduction.
I am Hazel Copperpot, of the Hupperdook Copperpots, inventor.
[cheering] And newly found storyteller.
-SAM-
An inventor and a storyteller! It sounds like a young-- well, a same age me, an exactly same age me.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Yes, yes.
You see, I am quite a fan of Taryon Darrington and all of your novels and your books and working long hours in the factory, I used your exploits to escape.
But, as I was reading, I thought: What if the other world could hear about these magical tales and adventures through an audio recording?
-SAM-
What is an audio recording? I write my books down on paper, like anyone else should.
-MARISHA-
Of course.
-SAM-
I'm sure you've heard of my books: The Man Who Should Be King.
-MARISHA-
Yes, that was a good one, not your best.
-SAM-
The Blonde, The Brave And The Bold.
-MARISHA-
That one was all right.
-SAM-
Taryon Darrington and The Half Blood Prince.
-MARISHA-
Absolutely my favorite.
[laughter] You see, I am the inventor of this contraption right here.
And you see, kind of like a-- well, it's a wax cylinder type of gramophone device with copper piping that goes up and she has a giant horn behind her.
This is the Copperpot Crank Action Audiomatic.
-SAM-
And it can record the human voice, you say?
-MARISHA-
Absolutely, and then some.
-SAM-
Can you demonstrate this weird contraption?
-MARISHA-
Why, yes, yes I can. You see, I would like to make you a pitch.
-SAM-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
You see I read an excerpt of one of your books, and thought I would give a little spin off it.
It was The Turbulent Trials Of Taryon Darrington and His Adventures of Vox Machina.
-SAM-
That's a page turner.
-MARISHA-
Yes, it really quite is.
So if you don't mind, and I pull out a wax cylinder, and I smash it into the device and I-- [Old Timey Radio Play Music] (laughter) [cheering] MARISHA (V.O. as Hazel): And now for the thrilling conclusion of Taryon Darrington versus the kraken of the Ashari.
[ascending wind chime] From the moment I laid eyes on the remote tribe of the water Ashari, it was clear that these druidic transients were in desperate need of my aid.
I saw the concern in the eyes of the rest of Vox Machina as we approached the gateway to the Plane of Water, and at that moment, I knew that I, Taryon Darrington, must bravely shoulder the burden of this task.
I stepped through the portal-- [ascending wind chime] - and was greeted with the intimidating expanse of an endless realm of water and desolation.
"We'll start gathering the stones," the antler-clad Keyleth remarked.
"Then I'll watch for the kraken!" I bolstered with heroic resolve.
I brandished my weapon [sword unsheathing] and peered into a darkness only familiar to the bizarre aquanauts of the deepest depths of the Lucidian Ocean.
Suddenly, the little elf girl exclaimed-- "Tary! Look out!"
-SAM-
This is the unabridged version.
-MARISHA-
(V.O. as Hazel) I followed the line of Vex's arrows to the enormous monstrosity: the kraken itself.
[growling] "Stay back, hideous cephalopod!"
-LIAM-
Bioshock Five is really weird.
MARISHA (V.O. as Hazel): I shouted as I unleashed a magical blast.
[ding] In retaliation to my display of power, the kraken whipped a tentacle towards Grog, [whip] incapacitating the innocent bystander instantly.
I knew triumph over the meaty mollusk was not worth the life of an apprentice... or a friend.
"Retreat!" I shouted, and with a mighty kick, I scooped up the unconscious body of the hulking goliath, and made a break for the portal.
[Old Timey Radio Play Music] (applause) [cheering]
-LAURA-
That was amazing.
(applause)
-MARISHA-
So you see, as incredible as I was able to make your totally accurate recounting of fighting the dragon sound--
-SAM-
It was, yes.
-MARISHA-
It lacks a certain pizazz, a certain, <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.
a certain oomph.
so if you would have me, I would love to go with you in your exploits and capture the battle live.
-SAM-
An audio recording of me live, in battle, winning hearts and minds?
-MARISHA-
Absolutely.
-SAM-
Wow, that's a lot to think about, I already have a biographer.
-MATT-
"Tary?" [laughter, awws]
-SAM-
Let's continue this conversation later.
-MATT-
The automaton leans over Tary's shoulder and you've never seen a creation of this magnitude scowl before.
[laughter] But it appears to be paying very close attention to you.
-MARISHA-
This must be Dotty.
-SAM-
It's Doty.
-MARISHA-
Oh sorry, big fan.
Quite magnificent, really.
-SAM-
He really is and he's been a loyal companion for many, many years so I'd hate to discard him but that technology is new and shiny.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
I would never want to be a replacement for Doty, he is quite a valuable teammate and an integral part of a incredible and compelling narrative.
Please, I am just bringing this incredible story to a different medium.
-SAM-
I'll think on this. Thank you for your amazing introduction. You are a strong candidate.
How about over here? You folks, you lot, who are you on the end there?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, can I just say, that was pretty fucking cool? [laughter] Yeah, I've seen a lot of shit in my day, and I've never seen anything like that, that was pretty fucking cool.
-MARISHA-
Why thank you, thank you young...lady?
-ASHLEY-
Sure.
[laughter]
My name is Damian Vadoma.
-MARISHA-
Damian Vadoma.
-ASHLEY-
You probably heard of my family.
We kind of deal with things a little underneath it all, you know? If you haven't heard of us then we're probably doing it right.
-SAM-
Are you spies of some sort?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean if you need something, we can get it for you.
-SAM-
Oh, I understand.
-ASHLEY-
Whatever it is, you know?
-SAM-
Something of an underworld organization.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah. Yeah.
-SAM-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
But I mean, I've read your books and stuff and I heard about this. I actually didn't realize it was nonprofit either but that's okay.
But I just, you know, I just wanted to try something-- I don't know, a little less immoral, I guess, and just see if I like it.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Oh, you're dipping your feet into--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, like I might get bored, but who gives a fuck? It's something to do.
[laughter] [cheering]
So Damian is half-elven, very tall, flaming orange hair, wearing a maroon suit, has two stilettos and the hilt of each, are brass knuckles.
-TRAVIS-
Fucking awesome.
-ASHLEY-
She's got tattoos everywhere that you can see. Latin, <i>vita, mors,</i> life, death, on her hands depending on the day, whatever she wants to give.
Across her neck she has a tattoo that says "never forget." [laughter]
-LAURA-
No regrets.
-SAM-
Next to Damian, who do we have there?
-LIAM-
(very low-pitched and gravelly) My name is-- [cheering]
My name is Buddy.
-SAM-
Buddy.
-LIAM-
(drawn-out) Buddy.
[laughter]
He is a nine-foot-tall ogre.
[cheering]
-LAURA-
He's so cute!
-LIAM-
He is slow-moving, hunched over, wears a hat with mudflaps hanging down the side of his face.
He is squinting; he really looks like he cannot see that well.
He has a large, hulking metal breastplate on his torso and a rough plank of wood tied to his shoulder with a halfling sitting on it.
[laughter]
(grunting) Uh.
Mac, what do I say?
-TRAVIS-
(high-pitched, slightly goofy) Nothing, you're doing great! [laughter, cheering] [continued cheering] Wow, you guys are a really cool looking group! This is my pal, Buddy.
Buddy is a very special ogre.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-TRAVIS-
Buddy, give them a wave.
-LIAM-
Hey.
-SAM-
Buddy.
[cheering] Buddy, it looks like you're looking at my companion, Doty.
I'm over here, can you not see me?
-TRAVIS-
Buddy, to the right, to the right!
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
To your other right!
-LIAM-
Okay.
-SAM-
You may need some ocular correction.
You know what? Here at the Darrington Brigade, we have all sorts of implements, tools, equipment engineered by yours truly, and maybe I could hook you up with something that could help you see a little bit better.
-LIAM-
What's "octopus connection"?
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy, yeah, no.
Short words. Short, <i>tiny</i> words.
-SAM-
Me fix you eyes.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Okay.
[laughter]
-MATT-
About this time, wandering from the mansion, you see stepping through the door looking a bit curiously and then quickly with a big grin rushing up, a tall half-orc, bright smile on his face, short dark hair on top, breastplate, sword on the back, waves up.
"Hi, sorry, I didn't realize we were having guests here."
-SAM-
Oh, this is one of our current members, Lionel, introduce yourself.
[cheering]
-MATT-
"Hey guys, I'm Lionel Gayheart, one of the original members of this brigade, and I'm also the backup field commander.
So if he's not around, listen to me.
Did I do it right, did I do it okay?"
-SAM-
You did just fine. He also speaks fluent Duck, if you ever need that.
-ASHLEY-
What was that?
-SAM-
He can speak to ducks.
-MATT-
(quacking) [laughter] [cheering]
-SAM-
Now, apart from Lionel here, who is a stalwart member of the brigade, as you may have heard, some of the members of the brigade have taken a sabbatical when they found out the nonprofit nature of the group, and I assume that you are all here to present yourselves as candidates for membership.
Real quick, before we get into it, I want to take a survey.
Doty, take down their responses.
How did you hear about the Darrington Brigade auditions?
-B-
On a magical message delivered by a hag,
-C-
From a flyer posted around the continent?
-ALL-
C.
-SAM-
C, so it was the flyers, then. Excellent job, Doty, money well spent.
-LIAM-
What?
-SAM-
Well, congratulations on taking the first step in your new career. We in the brigade do more by 9:00am than most people do by 10:00am! Small disclaimer, I want to make sure that you are all very aware of the nonprofit nature of the group, right? You've got that, we're all on board? Excellent.
-MARISHA-
But intellectual property rights, we can discuss--
-SAM-
We'll discuss that later.
-TALIESIN-
A stipend might be a way to go or something.
-SAM-
Ooh, The Owlbear, we'll talk about that as well.
But the first step in the process is the initiation.
Lionel, I will let you take it over from here.
-MATT-
"You got it, boss. All right, so first we got to get you wearing some of our officially branded materials here and then we're going to throw you in the pit and see what you got."
-SAM-
Yeah, we have a warehouse over here with some of my experiments and developments that aren't quite done or have been used and discarded.
-MATT-
"Right, right, yeah, come on, follow me." He turns around and happily skips towards this-- it's a warehouse. You can see it was once a wood storage shed for the winter.
He goes around and starts grabbing all sorts of shields and objects and items and manages to find that pair of goggles he requested. He goes, "I think these should fit your face pretty good."
-TRAVIS-
Gently, gently!
-LIAM-
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
How's that?
-LIAM-
Oh! [laughter]
-SAM-
Those are very special goggles that should let you see very keenly.
-LIAM-
He looks over at Taryon.
Oh! You are pretty.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Correct, yes.
[laughter]
Also, that fellow on your back, was it Mac?
-LIAM-
Mac.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, no, my name's Macaroni Samsonite.
[laughter]
-SAM-
It looks like awkward bench seating you've got up there.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it's not very stable, but it's the best way I can steer him in the right direction.
-LIAM-
I've got you.
-TRAVIS-
My foot, he's crushing my foot.
-SAM-
I think we can do better than that.
There was a chariot I was developing for a while imbued with electronic powers, but I never really finished it. Lionel, do you think we could retrofit it for the ogre there?
-MATT-
"Probably.
I could try.
Yeah, we could... try.
Hold on."
-SAM-
It's all I ever ask.
-LIAM-
What's "hydroponic"?
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
Right by that time, the wood board is pulled off by a really excited Lionel, and begins affixing onto your shoulders, a much more comfortable strapped like mechanism with a large platform in the back, elements he's like cutting off with his hatchet, his handaxe and making it fit quite right as he can.
It's still a little rickety, but you put it on and it actually fits pretty nice. It has these little blue crystals that are affixed to the bottom of it.
-LIAM-
Shiny.
-MATT-
This, much like every single other piece of equipment you've acquired, are all very brightly branded with the Darrington Brigade logo.
-SAM-
TD, TM.
-LIAM-
(grunting)
-SAM-
Does that suit you well? Does it fit your hunchy back?
-LIAM-
I don't know.
-SAM-
Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Anyone else need any items, anything to help you in the battles ahead?
-ASHLEY-
What do you have?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
A little of everything.
-ASHLEY-
What are you offering?
-MATT-
"All right, let's go ahead and get the rest of this bulk out here, then." Pulls out the books and over the next 20 or so minutes, you guys work through all of your possible requests, of which near none of them are fulfilled, but a handful of them are, and you manage to acquire a few independently created Taryon Darrington brand magical items of which you now have access to.
Upon everyone being outfitted--
-TALIESIN-
Cool, cool.
-MATT-
Lionel looks over and goes, "So boss, should we take them outside to do the initiation?"
-SAM-
Absolutely, let's go.
-MATT-
"Okay, follow me.
This is going to be fun."
-SAM-
Fun, fun, fun.
-MATT-
Leads you all outside into that sand pit that you saw around the training area.
Asks you all to line up and goes, "All right, so as it is required as members of the Darrington Brigade, you must follow the initiation rite of which was learned by his time being initiated into Vox Machina." [cheering]
-LAURA-
You guys did this! [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
We kicked his ass.
-MATT-
"A tried and true rite any adventurer should take.
So two volunteers up first." [laughter]
-LAURA-
I'll go.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, you're a fucking Owlbear, go.
-MATT-
"All right, Damian-- oh, all right, so we have Owlbear and Farriwen.
All right, stand in the pit."
-LAURA-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
-MATT-
"All right. And...
fight." [laughter] Roll initiative.
-LAURA-
Each other?! [laughter] [cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-SAM-
Doty brings out a plate of figs for me.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
18.
-TALIESIN-
10.
-MATT-
All righty.
All right, Farriwen, your turn's up first.
You see The Owlbear step out and look at you.
-LAURA-
Ooh!
-TALIESIN-
Come on.
-LAURA-
Okay.
You look very tough.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
All right, just going to take one of my stances.
I'm going to reach out with my flame hand and smack him in the middle of the chest, Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
Okay, roll for an attack.
-MARISHA-
Hey!
-LAURA-
Do I have to say I'm going to Stunning Strike right from when I hit or do I just--
-MATT-
You can say it once you've hit.
-LAURA-
I'm going to hit him.
-MATT-
All right, go for it.
-LAURA-
Oh god, okay, okay, okay.
This is so nerve wracking.
19.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-LAURA-
Yeah! Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, Owlbear.
-SAM-
The Owlbear.
-MATT-
The Owlbear.
-TALIESIN-
The Owlbear! 19.
-SAM-
What does that do, what does that mean?
-TALIESIN-
I think I save.
-LAURA-
He does save.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You're making your second attack, then?
-LAURA-
Yeah. Second attack, I'm going to Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
I'm going to try to hit him first.
Oh, that's cocked.
(yelps) Oh, okay, again that's high, 18.
-TALIESIN-
18 is my AC.
-LAURA-
So I hit him.
-MATT-
Yeah, so roll damage.
-LAURA-
Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
You have to still roll damage on these hits.
-LAURA-
Oh, I haven't been rolling damage!
-MATT-
No, you have not been.
She's new to the monk, folks.
It's okay.
-LAURA-
That's important! Oh shit.
10 on the first one, five on the second.
-MATT-
15 points of damage to you, The Owlbear.
Make a constitution saving throw for a second Stunning Strike.
-TALIESIN-
12.
-MATT-
That is a failure. You are now stunned.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh!
-MATT-
Until the end of her next turn.
Farriwen, you have your bonus action still.
Do you want to do anything?
-LAURA-
Yes, I'm going to Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
All right, two more attacks, both of these attacks with advantage because he is stunned.
-LAURA-
First attack, hits, second attack, definitely hits, okay.
-MATT-
Damage two more times.
-TALIESIN-
Hi, one. I miss you, one.
Look at that.
-LAURA-
Oh well.
-LIAM-
Take that, fantasy Frank Miller.
-TALIESIN-
(groans) I'm aware it's going to turn into more Lego Batman the longer this goes.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
13 points of damage for the Flurry of Blows.
-TALIESIN-
13 points.
-LAURA-
For my second move--
-SAM-
What?
-LAURA-
Because it's the end of my next turn, so I get to go again.
-SAM-
Wow, monks.
-MATT-
Yeah.
Owlbear man, you prepare yourself, you think, and this woman, this very colorful, ethereal woman suddenly moves with a speed you weren't expecting and with a couple of precise hits, you find yourself losing muscle control and coughing heavily.
Your vision blurs before you take a whole 'nother series of attacks, go for it.
-LAURA-
All right, for this next one, I'm going to spend another ki point.
-TALIESIN-
Well, hit first.
-LAURA-
Well, okay, fine.
-TALIESIN-
I mean, you know, I could dodge maybe.
-LAURA-
Advantage on this next one.
-TALIESIN-
Or is advantage over?
-LAURA-
No, no, no, I still get advantage because you're still stunned.
-TALIESIN-
Man.
-LAURA-
Nah, 15 doesn't hit.
Wow, how do I miss him when he's stunned?
-MATT-
He's that good.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I smell kind of bad, too.
-LAURA-
Okay, I'm going to circle around back and step behind him.
Yeah, that definitely hit, 17 plus.
I'm going to spend a ki point and invoke my Fangs of the Fire Snake.
-SAM-
Whoa, what is that?
-LAURA-
My arm that has the flame glyphs going up the side, I'm going to squeeze my fist really tight and the glyphs are going to start to glow orange.
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm going to punch you right in the small of your back.
Like by your kidneys?
-MARISHA-
Kidney punch?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All right, so roll damage.
-LAURA-
Oh, oh, oh, wait, oh that's really good.
Hold on, let me see what I did.
[laughter] Okay, so I'm going to hit him regular and then, woo! Then I do flame damage. Oh, that's good.
-SAM-
Oh damn.
-LAURA-
16 points.
-TALIESIN-
16 points.
-LAURA-
Then I'm going to spend another ki point.
-SAM-
What? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Fucking monks.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Nom, nom, nom.
-MATT-
You're telling me.
-LAURA-
And do Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
All right, two more strikes.
-SAM-
I've already finished the plate of figs.
Getting a second one.
-LAURA-
Natural 20.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit! What the fuck, man?
-TALIESIN-
Monks, man.
-LAURA-
So that's 12, plus six is 18 plus four is 22 points of damage on that one.
And then for my--
-SAM-
Is that double those dice?
-LAURA-
Yeah, I doubled that.
Then for my next attack.
-TRAVIS-
She is fucking him up.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
That definitely hits.
Oh that sucks, okay.
Eight plus one so nine points of fire damage.
-TRAVIS-
Nein!
-LAURA-
Nein points of fire damage and then while he's stunned, I'm going to back up my entire movement which is what?
-MATT-
At 10th level, it should be around 50 feet, I believe.
-LAURA-
Around 50 feet, yes I'm going to back up 50 feet.
-MATT-
50 feet away.
-LIAM-
Jeez. Jeez.
[cheering]
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
So Owlbear man, manbearpig-Owlbear-man.
Owlbear, it's your turn. You come back, you're sore, you've been battered in various places of your body and you watch as this same figure just shunts back about 50 feet from you. What are you doing?
-TALIESIN-
Well.
[laughter]
I am, first of all, going to rage.
-TRAVIS-
Oh! [cheering]
-TALIESIN-
(roars) I am going to move my full 40 feet towards-- (laughs) Towards you, which is not quite close enough.
-LAURA-
My name is Farriwen.
-TALIESIN-
Farriwen.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Name's Dead Meat now.
(laughter)
I believe I can add movement with my bonus action, I think I can, I have a dash.
-MATT-
You used your bonus action to go into a rage.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, okay, I used it to go into a rage, so that's as far as I can go.
Then I'm going to circle around at 20 feet.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
And I'm going to throw two daggers. I'm going to-- Can I get advantage on this, or does that have to be a close-up strike?
-MATT-
Well, if you're raging, it's strength-based, then you can get the advantage on that if you do reckless.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, so yeah.
For a thrown, I can do strength, yeah.
-LAURA-
Advantage?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, so I'm going to take advantage on that.
-LAURA-
Are you doing reckless?
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to reckless on the first one.
-MATT-
Well, you do reckless, it's for the full round.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, for the full round. Yeah, let's do it.
Just see what happens.
[cheering]
That's negative five, I believe, to hit.
15 to hit?
-LAURA-
Nope.
-TALIESIN-
Next one.
-LAURA-
I'm dart-y.
-TALIESIN-
And it's a negative five to strike, right?
-MATT-
For what?
-TALIESIN-
For when you take reckless attacks? Oh no, I'm so sorry, I'm using gunslinger rules.
That would've been 20 to hit. I'm so sorry.
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah, no, it's just advantage on the attacks and advantage against you.
So 20, the first one hits?
-LAURA-
That hits, all right, fine.
-TALIESIN-
That hits. So that's 1d8 plus I'm going to take my sneak attack damage because I have advantage against you.
-MATT-
Yes, you do.
-SAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah.
-SAM-
Wait, you're a rogue barbarian?
-LIAM-
Think about it, think about it.
-MARISHA-
It's pretty cool, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
(counting)
-LAURA-
Oh, that's really good.
-SAM-
That's mean.
-TALIESIN-
16 points of damage.
Then I'm going to throw another knife for my second attack.
That's 19 to hit.
And that's eight points of damage.
-LAURA-
Fine.
-TALIESIN-
And I am 20 feet away from you and raging.
-MATT-
All right. Farriwen, it's your turn.
-TALIESIN-
(growling)
-MATT-
As a reminder, you can deflect missiles if they come at you.
-LAURA-
Ah, balls.
[laughter]
-MATT-
But it is your turn, so what do you want to do?
-LAURA-
It's my first time being a monk.
-MATT-
I know.
-LAURA-
All right.
All right, then I'm going to-- wait, hold on.
-TALIESIN-
It's okay, I forgot there's extra damage.
So I forgot that, we're even.
-LAURA-
Screw it, I'm going to try to run forward and hit him again.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-LAURA-
I get advantage because he was advantage, right?
-MATT-
Yep.
-LAURA-
Ha! Oh shit, that doesn't hit.
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Shut up.
I'm going to try, wait, hold on, let me see.
-TALIESIN-
That's right.
-LAURA-
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Okay, I'm going to do it again.
Okay, that one does hit.
-TALIESIN-
That one does hit?
-LAURA-
That one does hit.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah, it does.
-LAURA-
So Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
Roll your damage and then you make a constitution saving throw, Owlbear.
-TALIESIN-
Do I have advantage on constitution saving throws because I'm raging?
-SAM-
I think it's strength, right?
-MATT-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Strength, just strength.
-LAURA-
Seven points of damage.
-TALIESIN-
Halved to three, or four? [laughter]
-MATT-
Yeah, that rage is a mother, isn't it?
-TALIESIN-
Halved to three, right?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I know, look at that.
And a constitution saving throw.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
15.
-LAURA-
You fail!
-SAM-
Man.
-MATT-
Stunned again.
All right, you have your bonus action, Farriwen.
-SAM-
Doty, take this down: Monks are overpowered as shit.
-TALIESIN-
No shit.
[laughter] [cheering]
-MATT-
"Tary."
-SAM-
Perfect, well good.
-LAURA-
Flurry of Blows. Can you do two things with ki points in one turn?
-MARISHA-
Yes, you can.
-LAURA-
Sweet.
-MARISHA-
Use as many as you like, honey bun.
-LAURA-
Then I'm going to spend a ki point to Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
Two more attacks with advantage.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-LAURA-
And I'm going to spend a ki point to Flame Strike him.
Fire Snake from my hands.
Oh that's good. Oh shit, that's good.
So that's 10 points plus eight points of fire damage.
-TALIESIN-
That's 18 halved so that's--
-SAM-
Nine.
-TRAVIS-
Fire damage is not halved.
-TALIESIN-
It is for me.
-MATT-
It for him.
-ALL-
Oh! [cheering]
-TALIESIN-
So that's only nine points of damage.
-MATT-
It's almost like the totem's half his name.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, right.
-TALIESIN-
Just nine points, that's fi-- I'm unconscious.
-MATT-
(laughs) (cheering)
-LAURA-
I'm going to levitate up in the air and take a bow.
-SAM-
Yeah, amazing.
[applause]
-MATT-
"That was pretty impressive, boss."
-TALIESIN-
Holy shit, motherfucker.
-SAM-
Farriwen, that was incredible.
-LAURA-
Thank you.
-SAM-
We will confer, but your chances look very good.
Yeah, that was amazing.
Yes, Lionel, what do you think?
-MATT-
"I think we should maybe consider her."
-SAM-
Okay, okay, okay.
Next pair!
-MATT-
"Volunteers, anyone?"
-MARISHA-
Taryon, you know, I'm more of a support person, you know.
-MATT-
"All right, so you're up next and--" [laughter] "Ogre." [laughter] [cheering]
-LIAM-
Huh? Oh! You're pretty.
-MARISHA-
Hello.
Hi, yes, you're ... big! Quite large, yes, you are. Hello!
-LIAM-
Small.
-MARISHA-
That's me.
-TRAVIS-
End her.
-MATT-
"And fight."
-LIAM-
What?
-MATT-
Roll initiative.
-MARISHA-
(screams)
-LAURA-
Oh god!
-MARISHA-
(screams)
-LIAM-
Six.
-MARISHA-
Nine.
-MATT-
Ah.
[laughter, cheering]
-MARISHA-
Nice, yeah.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All right, Hazel, you're up first. What are you doing?
-MARISHA-
Oh shit, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I see the hulking giant coming towards me and I take out one of my wax cylinders and I slam it into my device, into my Audiomatic, trademark, and I start playing.
(sings circus music) (blows tiny kazoo) And I cast Confusion.
-LIAM-
I'm already confused.
[laughter]
-MATT-
That's pretty great. All right.
So Buddy--
-MARISHA-
It is a wisdom.
-MATT-
If you could go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, please.
-LIAM-
Uh-oh.
(laughter)
14.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-SAM-
Pretty good.
-MARISHA-
Fail.
-LIAM-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
You cannot take reactions, and you have to roll a d10 at the start of each round to determine your behavior.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
Are you staying put or are you moving away, Hazel?
-MARISHA-
I am going to back away.
(sings circus music)
-MATT-
(laughs) All right, Buddy, roll a d10 for me.
-LIAM-
Two.
-MATT-
You don't move or take actions this turn.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Why are we fighting? [laughter]
-MATT-
Hazel, you're up.
I love this so much.
[cheering] This is the best.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
You know what, I don't quite know, big guy, but I am quite sorry! And I take out another cylinder and I slap it in.
-LIAM-
Are you playing music?
-MARISHA-
[sleigh bells ringing] And out of my horn, I cast Color Spray at Buddy.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-SAM-
Oh, poor Buddy! [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
It's the rainbow of pain.
-TRAVIS-
Buddy likes colors.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
I'm seeing them for the first time.
(laughter)
Blink, blink, blink.
-MATT-
Oh my goodness, all right.
-LIAM-
By the way, Buddy is now wearing large, coke bottle glasses that make his eyes look abnormally large.
-MATT-
Hazel, what level are you casting it?
-MARISHA-
I am going to cast it at third "leviel."
-LAURA-
(laughs) "Leviel."
-SAM-
That's how they talked in the old days.
-MARISHA-
Yes, it is.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
So that should mean that I'm doing 10d10 damage?
-MATT-
No, you roll 10d10 to see how many hit points of creatures you can affect.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
Okay, yeah same thing.
-LIAM-
Good luck.
-MARISHA-
First three.
Oh, kind of crap. 10.
Oh, 21, 26, that was, so I need to roll four more.
-LAURA-
Six, yeah.
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
What we were at, 26?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MARISHA-
35 and one more.
39 damage.
-MATT-
It is not damage, that is how many hit points of creatures it can affect.
-MARISHA-
39 hit points that will solely affect Buddy.
-MATT-
Do you have--
-LIAM-
Ooh, that's pretty!
-MATT-
Buddy, do you have more than 39 hit points, correct?
-LIAM-
Way more.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Has no effect on him, unfortunately.
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-LIAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
He's a much tough-- [laughter] - a much tougher ogre than those you might be used to.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit, that's important to know next time.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Better to get that out now than later.
-LIAM-
Mac, Mac, did you see?
-TRAVIS-
That was great.
-MARISHA-
Even if he was hit by it, does that mean he's still blinded by it, or no, not at all?
-MATT-
It unfortunately, it only affects up to a certain number of hit points of creatures.
-LIAM-
It's like the Sleep spell, Marisha.
[laughter] You have to surpass my hit points.
-MATT-
Buddy, roll a d10.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Oh, is he still confused?
-MATT-
Yes, he is.
-LIAM-
Three.
-MATT-
All righty.
You don't move or take actions.
[laughter] The colors are so bright and so beautiful in ways you've never seen before.
-MARISHA-
For like a minute.
-MATT-
Hazel, you're up.
-LIAM-
Are we done yet? (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Nothing's happened to you yet.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
It's like I'm Grog! (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
There's just lights and shit.
-MARISHA-
That's dumb, I don't want to do that, I am such a support class.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
Do you have a weapon at all?
-MARISHA-
No, I'm a bard in a one man band suit! [laughter]
-LAURA-
Hit him with a cymbal.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am going to listen to Farriwen, where is it, I haven't used spells in a while.
[laughter] Okay.
Okay, I'm going to run up and with my cymbals, I'm going to go (crashing) and I'm going to crash and I'm going to do Shatter right across--
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Poor Buddy's head.
-LIAM-
(grunts)
-MATT-
All right.--
-MARISHA-
And let's do it at 3rd-level.
-MATT-
3rd-level? All righty, Buddy, I need you to make a constitution saving throw, please.
-LIAM-
Okay.
That's five.
[laughter]
-MATT-
You take 4d8 thunder damage.
-LAURA-
Oh Buddy.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-SAM-
Oh buddies.
-LAURA-
Buddies, Buddy.
Okay, nine plus seven, no, nine plus seven is not 11.
[laughter]
16.
-MARISHA-
16.
Thank you and then--
-LAURA-
20.
-MARISHA-
20 total damage.
-MATT-
20 points of thunder damage to you, Buddy.
All right, and so you moved up close to Buddy, are you going to move back or stay right there in the fray?
-MARISHA-
No, I'll jog back.
(tambourine jingling) [laughter]
-MATT-
All righty, finishing back, she's about--
-LIAM-
How far away is she? What's your movement?
-MARISHA-
I'm a dwarf--
-LIAM-
I need to know.
-MARISHA-
25 feet.
-LIAM-
25 feet.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-MARISHA-
I'm probably--
-MATT-
You moved up to do Shatter and then moved back.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, but I didn't move into base.
So I'm probably like 50 feet back?
-MARISHA-
If it's that big.
-MATT-
What was the range on Shatter?
-MARISHA-
Shatter is like a 60-foot range.
60 feet.
-MATT-
Okay. So yeah, so you don't have to be that close for that, we'll say since she said it, 50 feet.
-LIAM-
50 feet, got it.
-MATT-
All right, roll a d10 for me, Buddy.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
Five.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Oh, at the end of your turns, you have a saving throw, I forgot about that.
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
My bad.
So roll another saving throw for me.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
That's cocked.
-MATT-
Then roll it again.
[laughter]
-SAM-
I will wink at him and give him a little bit of a boost.
I'll flash my genius at him and give him a plus four to that roll.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
Is this a wisdom save?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Plus four, not a d4?
-LIAM-
17.
-MATT-
17, does that succeed?
-MARISHA-
17 for the Confusion? 17 is what you need.
-MATT-
All right, you have your turn, Buddy.
You now, the spell fades, you have control.
-LIAM-
He slowly swings his head over to Macaroni and says: I thought we were here to make friends.
-LAURA-
Aw.
-LIAM-
He starts running towards the dwarf and after 10 feet, leaps.
-MARISHA-
I want to be friends, I want to be friends.
-LIAM-
25 feet.
-MARISHA-
I want to be friends.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
So that's 35 feet and then he closes the distance and he's holding this gigantic brass or golden jewel-studded club that he was just given.
I-- I like you.
(growls)
-MARISHA-
I like you, too! [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-LIAM-
The first one misses.
That's a 13.
-MARISHA-
Miss.
-LIAM-
The second one is a 27.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Definitely hits.
-LIAM-
One second.
[laughter] Not too bad.
That's cocked.
It's a pyramid, how did it get cocked? [laughter] 13 points of damage, and I'm going to use action surge.
-MARISHA-
(groans) [cheering]
-LIAM-
The first one is cocked between 11 and 13.
I should've kept it.
(laughter) That's 17.
-MARISHA-
Hits.
-LIAM-
And the second one hits, too.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Damage twice.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
The first hits for 13.
-MARISHA-
My drum.
-LIAM-
And the last one hits for 12.
Hello, lady.
-LAURA-
Aw.
-MARISHA-
Hello, big man.
-LIAM-
All done.
-MATT-
Hazel, your turn.
-MARISHA-
Son of a bitch.
Okay.
Well.
(stammers) I like you.
I'm going to say: I like you too, big man, and you know what? I do want to be friends.
I don't want to fight anymore and you know what? I don't think there is a competition after ee-all.
And I'm going to cast Modify Memory.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All right, go ahead and make a wisdom save.
You have advantage on it because you are fighting.
-LIAM-
Oh.
All right.
-MARISHA-
There was no fight.
(triangle tinging)
-LIAM-
19.
-ALL-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
Fuck.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Ouch.
-MATT-
All right, are you doing anything else on your turn? Stay put?
-MARISHA-
Well.
No.
[laughter] I would like to move away.
-TALIESIN-
Very quick.
-MARISHA-
If I could.
Hang on, let me make sure I mark a spell slot here.
Then, I am, you know, I'll just stay there, I don't want to incur the wrath of the beast.
[laughter] Yep.
-MATT-
All right, Buddy, you're up.
-LIAM-
I thought we were fighting now.
Okay, and I swing at her twice.
-MARISHA-
(scared noise) The first one is a 26.
-TALIESIN-
Woof!
-SAM-
Jesus.
-LIAM-
The second one is 14.
-MARISHA-
14 misses.
-LIAM-
Okay.
That's 13 points of bludgeon damage.
-MARISHA-
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
What did you say, 14?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
What, you didn't understand what he said? [laughter]
-MARISHA-
All right.
-MATT-
All right, Hazel.
-MARISHA-
All right, jeez louise.
I am going to say, you know I really like your new goggles.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Shame.
For what I'm about to do.
I throw in another wax cylinder and then I crank it up and-- (sings "Toccata in D Minor") [laughter] And I cast Blindness on him.
-TRAVIS-
No! (groaning)
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy.
-MATT-
That's rough, Buddy.
-ASHLEY-
Buddies.
-MATT-
Buddy.
All right.
Go and make a constitution saving throw for me, Buddy.
-LIAM-
Okay.
I will use Indomitable.
-MATT-
All right.
-LIAM-
To reroll save.
Natural 20.
(laughter) [cheering]
-LAURA-
Sorry, Hazel.
-MARISHA-
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Magnific-ient.
-MATT-
Anything else, Hazel?
-LIAM-
What's up next? [laughter]
-MARISHA-
Hazel will cast Healing Word on herself.
-MATT-
You've already cast one spell.
-MARISHA-
It's a bonus action.
-LAURA-
You can't do two spells.
That's new.
-MATT-
Well, technically, it's original.
-LAURA-
Well!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
That's 80 episodes new.
[laughter]
-MATT-
She's been a monk for a while, man.
-TALIESIN-
Must be nice.
-MARISHA-
I will-- [laughter] Continue to be pummeled by Buddy.
-MATT-
Buddy, your turn.
-LIAM-
I'm okay to stop.
[laughter] First one's 17, second one 20.
-MARISHA-
Both hit.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
13 and 11.
-TALIESIN-
Take a pounding, man.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
A lot of hit points.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Hazel, you can end this, you know?
-MARISHA-
What?! No, you never set up any parameters!
-SAM-
I realize there could've been more rules to this.
-MATT-
"Yeah, no, she's actually telling the truth there, boss, we didn't put it a lot of specification to this."
-SAM-
If you want to end this, just say the word, we'll tap you out.
-MARISHA-
That feels like a cop out.
-SAM-
It might, but just so you know, you made a whole pitch with my voice in it so, you're probably going to get in anyway.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Really?
-SAM-
I mean, yeah.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I did come prepared with a nice presentay-tion.
-SAM-
You did, as the old folks say.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Are we still fighting?
-MARISHA-
I'm sorry, Buddy, and I give a Healing Word to Buddy.
-SAM-
Oh! Well, that's the very definition of team work then, isn't it?
-MARISHA-
Yes, you're right, I am very generous.
-LAURA-
Could you give one to Owlbear? He's still unconscious.
-TALIESIN-
(gibberish) (laughter)
-SAM-
Oh god! Did he die? Is he dead?
-MATT-
They weren't fighting to the death, he's just been unconscious this whole time.
[laughter]
-SAM-
There's a pool of blood! (laughter)
-MARISHA-
All right.
-LAURA-
No, it's internal bleeding.
Don't worry.
-MARISHA-
I give--
-TRAVIS-
Buddy's just stomping all over Owlbear.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
That's a rat! (growling)
-MARISHA-
I give seven hit points to Buddy.
And I heal nine hit points to the dead Owlbear.
-TALIESIN-
Evil, crime.
-SAM-
An excellent fight.
An excellent, excellent fight, very entertaining, even though none of your spells seemed to work, they were very original.
[laughter] And Buddy, you were great.
-MARISHA-
I would like to think that Confusion spell worked quite nicely, but you know.
-LIAM-
Buddy reaches out to shake her hand and sees it for the first time in between his thumb and his forefinger and goes, We are friends. Hi!
-MARISHA-
I do believe this is the start of a beautiful relay-tionship.
[laughter] Also, if you are looking for a manager or representation-- [laughter] Just, I'll give you my card.
-TRAVIS-
Hey lady, get your own ogre.
-MARISHA-
Sorry! [laughter]
-MATT-
"Okay, so we have Damian and Macaroni, was it?"
-TRAVIS-
Macaroni!
-MATT-
"All right, get--"
-LIAM-
You're pretty.
-MATT-
"-- in the middle." [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
I hop in the ring.
You know what's so great about this? This reminds me of my family gatherings for holidays.
[laughter] Yeah, this is great.
-SAM-
Are you from Bostonia? [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, we're from everywhere.
-MATT-
All right, if I can have Mac and Damian, go ahead and roll initiative for me, please.
-ASHLEY-
20.
-TRAVIS-
15.
-MATT-
All right, Damian, you're up first as you guys square off in the middle of the dusty sandpit.
Pulling the stilettos from your sheaths, what are you doing?
-ASHLEY-
So I pull those out, spin them around.
I'm like: yeah, these pretty cool.
Feel them out and as a bonus action to start, where did it go? Here it is.
I'm going to produce flames from one of these swords.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's fucking cool.
Oh, it's going to stay on there, okay.
[laughter] And now I'm going to attack Macaroni.
-TRAVIS-
Uh oh.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
First attack.
Oh, that's no music, it's so quiet now.
[laughter] Ah, shit.
12.
-TRAVIS-
Miss.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Second attack.
-TRAVIS-
Hey batter, batter, batter swing.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
21.
-TRAVIS-
Shit, piss! [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-MATT-
(chuckles)
-ASHLEY-
17 points of damage.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-ASHLEY-
Hey, you okay there, little man?
-TRAVIS-
I'm just fine.
(cackling) (sighs) Let's start this off right.
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-TRAVIS-
And I will cast Flame Strike.
[laughter]
-MATT-
So you watch as Damian checks out the weapons, rushes forward, miss, stab, oh good attack.
(explosion) (laughter) A column of divine fire bursts from the ground beneath Damian.
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-TRAVIS-
Light them up baby, woo! [laughter] [cheering] I need you to make a dexterity 15 saving roll.
-ASHLEY-
'Kay.
I'm going to use Indomitable for that.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Because that was shit.
Yeah.
22.
-SAM-
Oh.
Oh, she did it.
-MATT-
All right, so that's 8d6 fire and radiant damage halved, so go ahead and roll that up there.
-TRAVIS-
So that's 25 points of fire damage, reduced to 12 and 23 points of radiant damage, reduced to, I don't know.
-SAM-
11? 11?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, 11.
-TALIESIN-
Cool.
-TRAVIS-
You see Macaroni is in all this makeshift bone and hide armor, looking like the Lost Boys from Peter Pan.
He looks at you and goes: Bring it on!
-MATT-
All right, Damian, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
All right, I like this little man.
You know what, I'm going to make this fight a little more fair, yeah? I'm going to bonus action cast Giant Might on myself.
-SAM-
Cast what?
-TRAVIS-
What?
-SAM-
Giant Might?
-MATT-
You watch as she takes her finger and draws this rune across the front of the suit that's she is wearing and as she finishes up this rune, in but a split second of the eye, her body grows to near twice its size.
-TRAVIS-
That just seems unnecessary.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Nah, it's entirely necessary.
-LIAM-
Oh! You're pretty! [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
15 for the first hit.
-TRAVIS-
Miss!
-ASHLEY-
Natural one.
[laughter]
Are we still doing the thing?
-TRAVIS-
What thing? Oh yeah, that's a one, 500 bucks for OSD, woo! [cheering]
-ASHLEY-
So both shots miss.
-MATT-
Ugh.
All right, Macaroni, you're up.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
(shrieking) I will cast Spirit Guardians at 5th level.
[cheering] I need you to make a wisdom 15 saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Goddamn it.
Wait, hold on, let me see if I have anything for this.
(groans)
-SAM-
Fail.
-ASHLEY-
I failed.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
That's 22 points of necrotic damage.
-LAURA-
What do your spirit guardians look like?
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
Do they look like macaroni?
-TRAVIS-
They look like these really cute porcupines that come out and then when they see you, they're like-- (bursting, hissing) [laughter]
(whooshing)
-MATT-
Perfect.
Damian, now taking that damage, it's your turn.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Cocked.
Yeah, that's better.
-SAM-
I'm going to float over on my flying broom and watch the action a little closer.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
What was that?
-ASHLEY-
19.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, no, that misses.
I like your tattoos, though.
-ASHLEY-
Ah, it's cocked, come on.
Goddamn it, no, it doesn't hit.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
Would it be better if I just stop moving for you? (laughter) [cheering] You know what, Tary, I think we should take advantage of your rules and maybe we should call this a-- Banishment! [laughter]
At 4th-level.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
So go ahead and make a--
-TRAVIS-
Charisma.
-MATT-
Charisma saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
15, please.
-ASHLEY-
15?
-MATT-
Travis, you're killing me.
-LAURA-
He's a mean cleric.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
11.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
Oh no! [cheering]
-LIAM-
Oh man, we just got her back! [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Bye bye!
-SAM-
Wow, incredible.
-MATT-
"That was really impressive."
-TRAVIS-
Please tell me I made the team, because I've got like 50 seconds.
[laughter]
-SAM-
I think it's clear that you did definitely make the team.
Lionel, thank you for--
-TRAVIS-
I should let you know though, we come as a package deal.
So either Buddy comes or I...
leave.
-SAM-
Buddy won his round, so he's also in.
-LIAM-
Yay!
-TRAVIS-
Hey, that's great.
-LIAM-
Yay.
-MARISHA-
I saw it more as an honorable truce, but you know.
-MATT-
It's about now that Damian reappears.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Boy, that was a hell of a place.
That's a pretty cool trick.
-TRAVIS-
No problem, lot better when I'm on your side.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
I was just going easy on you though because you're really small.
-MATT-
"Do we just tell the others to go away, then?
-SAM-
No, no, no.
We need all the help we can get.
I'll come clean with you guys.
I've been alone for quite some time now, and (sobbing) no one wants to adventure with me anymore.
I can't seem to attract anyone. We've tried flyers and magical means of advertising and no one wants to be in the Darrington Brigade.
-LAURA-
Well, maybe it's because you take away their treasure.
-SAM-
Well, but that was the whole point of the Brigade!
-MARISHA-
Also you could use some work on your marketing campaign.
I am more than willing to help you on your outreach.
-ASHLEY-
Do you cry, is like a thing that you do, because I don't know about this.
-SAM-
(crying) I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's just, I want to do good in the world! And no one wants to come with me.
-TRAVIS-
I know what you need. Buddy?
-LIAM-
Huh?
-TRAVIS-
Give him a hug.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-SAM-
No, it's okay.
I'm fine.
-TRAVIS-
No, give him a hug.
-MATT-
Lionel pushes Tary into Buddy.
(groaning)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, take it.
That's an ogre hug.
-LIAM-
Friends.
I can see your tears.
-SAM-
That's from the smell.
Thank you, if you will all have me, I would gladly welcome you all to the Taryon Darrington Brigade as probationary members.
Provided that you perform well in our first adventure.
-LIAM-
Buddy lifts Tary in the air.
Yay! (applause) [cheering]
-MATT-
Lawrence steps up at this point and goes like, "Well, if that is where we are, should we give them quarters then?"
-SAM-
Oh yes, yes, welcome to my home.
-MATT-
"<i>Our</i> home?
-SAM-
Sorry, sorry.
Welcome to our home.
I hope no one's allergic to dogs.
We have three lovely pups running around.
There's Barry, Carrie, and Danny.
That's short for Vax'ildan.
-AUDIENCE-
Aww.
-LIAM-
Yum.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, Buddy usually eats dogs.
Mr. Owlbear, you might want to stay a little further away.
-TALIESIN-
I got my eye on everybody, it's fine.
So there are lodgings then?
-SAM-
Yes, we have rooms for you that we've prepared.
-TALIESIN-
Took me by surprise there, that was good.
-SAM-
You can rest, recuperate, and see what the next day will bring.
-MATT-
"Indeed, follow me, I'll lead you to your rooms." Goes ahead and escorts the entirety of your troupe into the Darrington estate, now whereas once this was a beautiful mansion that housed the handful of wealthy members of the Darrington family, after losing their fortune and then reopening as a home to house the poor, as well as the Darrington Brigade and whatever else sort of chaos there is without much of an income, the house has fallen into a bit of disuse.
A number of the rooms are just hostel lodging for people that need a place to stay and you meet a couple folks, just wave to you as you pass by.
As Lawrence shows you to your different rooms, they're split into three and three, so three of you are sharing one room, three of you are sharing another.
You can decide which is which.
It is cramped, the furniture is dusty but it's a place at least while you're working together as a part of this adventuring group.
-TALIESIN-
I just need a hutch of some kind. I'll be fine.
If I can just get a corner, I can make something work in one of the closets. That's all right if someone wants the bed.
-LIAM-
You can sleep with us, rat man.
-TALIESIN-
Right, right.
-TRAVIS-
You look like you smell. You'll fit in just fine.
-TALIESIN-
I do. This is actually real owlbear musk so that I can enter their caves and not be attacked.
-TRAVIS-
That seems strange to me, I just want to attack you.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, no, it hasn't worked so far.
-TRAVIS-
Okay?
-TALIESIN-
Not really at all.
Working on it.
-LIAM-
You're pretty.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I know, that's true.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
So I guess it's the three of us then, huh?
-MARISHA-
Sounds quite exciting.
Look at us! The indomitable roommates! We should make our own secret society.
-LAURA-
Do you sleep with the music gear on?
-MARISHA-
You know, I do have a nice meditation track.
So if you're into that guided sleep meditay-tion, it's quite nice at night.
-SAM-
"Meditay-ti-on"?
-MATT-
As the afternoon draws on, you guys have arranged your spaces for the evening, the sun sets and you're all called down to the communal dinner within the Darrington estate. It was once a dining hall that could comfortably sit and feed maybe eight people.
Now it's feeding 17, yourselves included.
As you gather in the main area, there's a few of the transients that have been staying there for a bit.
Two other adventurers that just didn't have coin for an inn and had no interest in joining the brigade.
As well as the rest of you, Lionel, Lawrence, and of course Tary himself. Maria, your mother, comes in with all sorts of manner of food and cooked hams and rice and enough to try and feed a large group on a decent budget.
Goes ahead and places them out on the table and looks at everyone. "Well, I hope you enjoy your stay here.
Take care of him. Make sure he stays safe."
-ASHLEY-
Wait, this is your mom?
-SAM-
Yes, yes. I live with my mother.
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit. Hey, what's up Mrs. Darrington? [laughter] Shit. Sorry about my language.
-MATT-
"No, it's fine."
-ASHLEY-
I'm a little bit of a mess but thank you so much for letting us in your home.
-MATT-
"Of course, no.
My home is your home.
She's a cheeky one."
-SAM-
She is, she is.
Thank you for the meal, mother.
-TALIESIN-
Thank you, Mrs. Darrington.
-SAM-
Your support is eternally respected.
Please have a seat, dig in. This food is...
As much as you'd like. Mr. Ogre--
-LIAM-
Buddy has already eaten one third of the food.
-SAM-
Okay, great.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you know, before we get started, since everybody still looks the worse for wear, I'm going to cast Mass Healing Word and get everybody nice and pretty for dinner.
-SAM-
Very nice.
-LAURA-
Thank you.
-SAM-
Would anyone like to say a blessing for our meal before we dig in? No religious people here?
-MARISHA-
I've got a nice concerto I can play.
-SAM-
Well.
-TALIESIN-
Justice is my religion.
[laughter] [cheering]
-TRAVIS-
10 points of healing.
-MATT-
As you all begin to enjoy your meal, the open window that looks over the now star-studded sky of Deastok on the far end of the food chamber is alight with a green glow for but a moment as a beautiful shooting star crosses past the horizon, bright and beautiful.
You all toast to it, drink from your meal.
And hear--
-LAURA-
That's a sign.
-MATT-
-- a dull rumble in the distance.
-MARISHA-
We should make a wish.
-LIAM-
Excuse me.
[laughter]
Chippewa.
-SAM-
Did you fart?
-LIAM-
It's hard to tell.
-TRAVIS-
We usually refer to that as a preview.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, I get it. The fart's a preview for the shit.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
I get it.
That's a good joke.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Oh boy.
-ASHLEY-
Sorry, Mrs. Darrington.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"It's all right. Trust me, we get all kinds in here with all forms of senses of humor."
-ASHLEY-
It's just crass humor, it's fine.
-MATT-
As you all enjoy the rest of your meal, get to know each other a little bit, eventually finding yourselves ready to bed down from a day of strenuous activity beating the shit out of each other.
You go to your respective rooms, lay down and sleep well.
The morning comes, a bit groggy but a whole new day for possible adventure.
As you all begin to gather downstairs, a loud-- (knocking) comes at the front door of the estate.
(knocking)
-LAURA-
Should I get it?
-SAM-
Doty! Doty, go get the door. I'm still brushing my hair.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I hide.
-MATT-
Doty heads downstairs and opens the door.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) "I hide."
-TALIESIN-
Stealth 31.
-MATT-
Okay.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
I don't remember buying this shag carpet.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
It's a stuffed Owlbear.
(laughter)
-MATT-
This is the most ridiculous adventuring party.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Eventually, there's a moment of, like, brief talking from the other side of the door before you watch Doty lean back, "Tary."
-SAM-
All right, I run downstairs just finishing the last, 39, 40.
All right, who's at the door?
-MATT-
You come to the front door and you see standing there on the stoop, a old gnome woman in finely crafted travel outfit of leather and fine silk, a blue-green color scheme.
Her face is intense, though she has a smile that keeps it from becoming too stern.
She looks up to you, "Sorry to bother you, this is indeed the headquarters of the famed Darrington Brigade?"
-SAM-
Yes, but auditions were yesterday and we are full now, I'm afraid.
-MATT-
"Oh, well I-- (chuckles) I am not interested in joining your strange band.
I am more interested in perhaps using your company for a bit of work."
-SAM-
Oh, a client! Oh, please come in, Doty, get some tea or coffee, tea, what would you like?
-MATT-
"Tea would be fine."
-SAM-
Doty, go get some tea. (clapping) Go.
-MATT-
He rushes off.
"So and you are?"
-SAM-
Taryon Gary Darrington of the Darrington Brigade.
-MATT-
"It is a pleasure to meet you."
-SAM-
Yes, lovely to meet you. What can we do for you?
-MATT-
"Well, last night, it has come to my attention that a strange object--"
-SAM-
You know what, I'm going to stop you right there.
Brigade, Brigade, mount up, no, form up, form up! Form up, Brigade, we need you in here.
-MARISHA-
(tambourine jingling) (laughter)
-MATT-
One by one, you all gather down in the foyer area of the estate, there revealing a freshly brushed Taryon Darrington and this older gnome woman whose arms are crossed and, not impatiently, but expectantly waiting for your arrival.
-SAM-
I hand my hairbrush to Hazel.
This is a client, Brigade.
[laughter] We get clients like these all the time in the Brigade so it's pretty normal, but anyway. Go on, what's your job?
-MATT-
"Well, my name is Master Doolan Tversky and it has come to my attention this last evening, a strange object fell from the sky, crashing somewhere within the Cyrengreen Forest to the south of here.
I would like to hire you to retrieve whatever fell and bring it back to me."
-SAM-
You have no idea what this object is? Could it be some sort of celestial body? Was it a meteor?
-MATT-
"It might be.
Perhaps it was a creature and if it is, subdue it and bring it back to me.
If it is an object, gather it and bring it back to me.
I care not the process, just bring it."
-SAM-
Where did it fall?
-MATT-
"To the south of here in the Cyrengreen."
-SAM-
Oh, well that seems, that seems extremely treacherous and probably very expensive.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, you said this fell in the Cyrengreen Forest, is that what you just said?
-MATT-
"That is exactly what I said."
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Does that mean anything to you?
-ASHLEY-
No, I've never been there before.
-SAM-
Oh.
[laughter]
-MATT-
It's the forest directly south of Deastok.
-SAM-
Sure, sure.
What-- pardon me while I confer with my fellows.
What do I charge for this? I have no idea!
-LAURA-
I have no idea.
-SAM-
You're my manager.
-MARISHA-
Well, you should always put yourself higher because you can always negotiate lower.
-SAM-
10 gold.
-MARISHA-
No, no, no, wait and you should always confer with your manager first.
-SAM-
Sorry.
-MARISHA-
Let's see, all right, there's seven of us.
Let's round up, let's do 10 "thousiand" gold.
-SAM-
10 "thousiand" gold.
[laughter]
-MATT-
"You drive a hard bargain, but I accept your proposal."
-SAM-
What? [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Per hour.
[laughter] (applause)
-MATT-
The older gnome woman, this Master Tversky's head turns slowly towards you, Macaroni, the eyes suddenly flashing with some strange temporary energy.
"10 thousand, no more."
-SAM-
That sounds quite acceptable.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, but-- hold on a minute because I'm pretty good at making deals here.
If we bring back said object, is there an additional payment? You know what I mean? Like when I do deals, it's like, X amount of money for a body, whatever.
[laughter] This thing that thing.
-SAM-
A body?
-ASHLEY-
But just like what is the thing because you said there's like some objects in there, if we pick him up, bring it all back together, is it like if it's complete we can, you know, get extra money if we the pieces, what's the deal?
-MATT-
Make a persuasion check.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah!
-MARISHA-
And I will give her a bardy-ic inspiray-tion.
-SAM-
Ooh!
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
-TRAVIS-
And I will reach out and give her Guidance.
-SAM-
Whoa! [cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Ooh no, what do I--?
-TRAVIS-
d4.
-MATT-
d4.
Plus, what's your-- d--?
-MARISHA-
d10.
-MATT-
So you add a d4 and a d10.
-LIAM-
Roll a 10, Marisha.
-ASHLEY-
Shit, I don't have a 10, I don't have a 10.
-LIAM-
Here you go.
-TRAVIS-
(chicken noise)
-SAM-
How do you not have a 10?
-ASHLEY-
A six, so-- Oh boy, 13.
-SAM-
With all that?!
-MARISHA-
Wait, what? [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Maybe you don't haggle anymore.
[laughter]
-MATT-
"The job was to retrieve the object and bring it back."
-ASHLEY-
I understand. I think I'm thinking like a different kind of line of work, it's fine.
-MATT-
"Yeah, it's all right."
-ASHLEY-
This is just an object.
-SAM-
Retrieval.
-ASHLEY-
I'm sorry.
-MATT-
"Object, creature, I'm uncertain, but whatever it was that fell, please bring it back to me."
-SAM-
Any other details you can tell us, Madame Tversky?
-MATT-
"Unfortunately, no.
This is a relatively recent occurrence and you know, adventurers have their purpose which is generally to be the first on the scene."
-SAM-
Well, you've come to the right place.
Thank you very much for your patronage and where will we meet you, here?
-MATT-
"When you've returned with the bounty, you can find me within the Rose Nestle Inn here in Deastok."
-SAM-
Fine establishment.
-MATT-
"Of course, before I leave, could you please sign my copy of your book, if you don't mind."
-SAM-
Oh! [laughter] Oh, well, would you like me to make it out to you?
-MATT-
"No, just a signature's fine."
-SAM-
You're not going to resell this, are you, on Ebay or something?
-MATT-
"No, no, no." [laughter]
-SAM-
All right.
Taryon Darrington, XXOO, kiss symbol, heart, more Xs, more Os, [laughter] there you are.
-MATT-
"Thank you kindly. Well, good luck to all of you, I look forward to your return, good bye," she turns around and starts exiting out across the drying lawn out to the main gates.
-LIAM-
Bye, pretty lady.
-LAURA-
Mr. Darrington.
-SAM-
Yes, we have a job! I mean, we have a job, like always.
-LAURA-
Might I suggest in the future, anything you sign, you check for invisible ink.
You never know what it is you're signing.
-SAM-
Oh.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit.
-MARISHA-
I said that very quickly when we were conferring, but you didn't hear it.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Oh.
-MATT-
As you're having the thought--
-ASHLEY-
That's true, you coulda just signed something, you coulda just like signed your life away.
She's not wrong.
-LAURA-
It's true.
You could've.
-SAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
That's a thing that happens.
[laughter] Oh yeah.
-MATT-
At this point, Lionel's hand claps on your shoulder.
He's like, "Did I miss something, boss?"
-SAM-
Oh hi, Lionel, we are going on an adventure.
-MATT-
"Oh, great."
-SAM-
We've been hired to go retrieve an object that fell from the sky.
-MATT-
"That sounds great."
-SAM-
Are you feeling up to coming with us?
-MATT-
"Yeah, I had a night of bad dreams, but I could probably use a night out, a day out, a time out."
-SAM-
What were your dreams of?
-MATT-
"Man, it was just a lot of water and like, just couldn't get out of it, it was weird."
-SAM-
Were you swimming in it, or?
-MATT-
"At times, diving."
-SAM-
Then coming back to the surface?
-MATT-
"I couldn't though, the surface kept going away."
-ASHLEY-
Do you dream in duck? [laughter] You know like--
-MATT-
"Do you?"
-ASHLEY-
No, I don't speak it, I don't know it.
I mean, I've heard ducks quacking and whatever, but I don't know how to speak it.
-MATT-
"It's amazing the things they talk about when you're not watching."
-ASHLEY-
I bet you are correct, sir.
-MATT-
"I'll teach you sometime."
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'll take you up on that.
-MATT-
"All right, when we're on the road."
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
-SAM-
Well, we have a bonafide adventure on our hands, Brigade.
Gather your things because we are skipping breakfast and moving straight to the action.
-TRAVIS-
I don't know about skipping breakfast, Buddy gets super fucking hungry.
-LIAM-
Come on, Mac.
-TRAVIS-
(yelling)
-TALIESIN-
We're going to have adventure for brunch instead.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
To adventy-iure!
-SAM-
Everything is a one liner, it's amazing.
[laughter]
-MATT-
"He might not be a good fighter, but I like everything else about him." [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
We'll see, duck boy, we'll see.
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-SAM-
Doty, let's mount up and leave.
Do we have any horses in the stable?
-MATT-
"Tary?"
-SAM-
Lionel, do we have any horses in the stable?
-MATT-
"No, unfortunately the last brigade members stole-- was given to them--"
-SAM-
Borrowed, borrowed.
-MATT-
-- when they were dismissed."
-SAM-
When they took their leave of absence.
-MATT-
"Yes, at our request."
-SAM-
Go on vacation.
-MATT-
"Mm-hmm."
-TRAVIS-
Insight check! [laughter] 19.
-MATT-
Like you need me to do this, but sure.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Hey guys, as a special thank you to the people way up there, would the person, second balcony, row Y111 check under his or her seat because there's a little prize from me to you up there.
[cheering]
-LIAM-
Is it a blue shit? (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Spoilers.
(laughter) All right, so as you gather your things, you rush off breakfastless.
Southward.
-LAURA-
Take a coffee to go.
-MATT-
That can be arranged.
You make your way south through the city of Deastok.
Eventually coming upon the beautiful, if somewhat ominous treeline of the Cyrengreen Forest, one of the larger forests within the Empire.
As you enter, at first it's green and lush and a soft floor beneath a beautiful canopy this time of year.
A few more miles in, and it gets darker and darker, the branches growing thicker and more intertwined, the shadows growing deeper and the sounds of wildlife getting more and more prominent.
Who's leading this brigade, by the way?
-SAM-
Probably me.
-MATT-
I would like you to make a survival check, please.
-SAM-
No problem.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Survival. That's a 16.
-MATT-
16?
-SAM-
I know these woods.
-MATT-
You did, you grew up around here.
You guys continue to follow Taryon's lead passing by a few bumpier regions, but you happen to know a few shortcuts, and manage to avoid a couple of dangerous spots here in the Cyrengreen.
Lionel complains of a stomachache and that his duck sense is flapping wildly.
[laughter] But you manage to steer clear of any imminent danger.
Eventually, as the day turns into night and right as you begin to discuss a time to camp, you come upon a sight that you weren't expecting.
A very strange phenomenon where the trees begin to lose their leaves, where the trunks begin to lean in your direction.
The forest, as opposed to this deep, lush, green area, is becoming a flattened landscape of blackened bark and ash.
You see an entire region of rocky ground, of just flattened trees in a circular pattern and in the center, a crater of some kind.
-SAM-
Doty, take this down.
[laughter] As we approached the phenomenon--
-MARISHA-
As we approached the phenomenon.
-SAM-
Okay, well, that's new.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Doty turns over and glares at Hazel.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
The new recruits looked to their fearless leader for guidance.
-MARISHA-
The new recruits looked to their fearless leader for guidy-iance.
[laughter]
-SAM-
One in particular hung on every word of Taryon Darrington.
-MARISHA-
We can rewrite this, but one in particular--
-SAM-
They knew that no matter what was about to happen, they would be protected by his bravery, his power, and his machismo.
[laughter]
-MATT-
(book slamming shut) (laughter)
-MARISHA-
It's an incredible honor to be traveling alongside you.
(laughs)
-MATT-
"(unimpressed) Tary." (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit! (laughter)
-SAM-
Maybe we should fan out and move in on the center of the crater from multiple angles?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, sure.
-SAM-
Does any of you-- oh Owlbear man, are you able to check for traps and things?
-TALIESIN-
I'm currently at a stealth level of 18.
-SAM-
Where are you? [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I'm right behind you.
-SAM-
Oh shit! [laughter] Thank you for, that was amazing unnecessary hiding.
[laughter] Do you think you could scan the area for any traps or magical things?
-TALIESIN-
Well, maybe, hold on, let me think about this.
Never actually done this before, nothing like this anyway.
Are there animals nearby can see, any wildlife or--?
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-TALIESIN-
18.
-MATT-
18, yes actually, down by the crater's edge you can see a few shapes that appear to be either like grazing or animals that may have wandered into the space.
-TALIESIN-
Are we trying to be stealthy about this or--?
-SAM-
I think so, I think that's fair to say, yes.
-TALIESIN-
There's nothing to hide in on the way in, is there?
-MATT-
I mean aside from the pine like trees that are all turned at an immediate horizontal angle, and the branches that have been completely culled of leaves, it's like a loose tangle that you could try but it's not going to be easy.
-TALIESIN-
No, yeah, I don't really know how to, I could try and check for traps, I'm not sure how that works but--
-SAM-
Well, then don't do it.
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'm going to stealth in, I'm going to start stealthing in one tree at a time.
-LAURA-
So we just watch him as he crouches totally visible to the entire-- [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Sometimes I going to climb a couple trees, too, just to get vantage points.
-MATT-
Okay, the highest you can get on any of these flattened trees is about three feet.
-TALIESIN-
That'll do.
-MATT-
All right.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
On your perch.
-MATT-
Up top.
[laughter] Signaling you guys to continue.
[laughter] Your standing positions give you a better perspective than Owlbear.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
(owl hooting)
-TRAVIS-
No! No.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
I think he's telling us to move ahead.
-SAM-
Yes.
On we forge.
-MATT-
All right, you guys continue forward, are you going forward stealthily or not?
-TALIESIN-
Stealthily.
-MATT-
I would like everybody to roll a stealth check.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
Okay.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Natural one.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Oh did you really?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, okay, okay, that's good.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah.
-MATT-
The party's one rogue.
[laughter] Farriwen, what'd you get?
-LAURA-
A 10.
-MATT-
Okay.
Hazel.
-MARISHA-
14.
-MATT-
All right, Tary?
-SAM-
Eight for me and eight for Doty.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Oh that's not good, that's a natural three for Lionel.
-ASHLEY-
18.
-TRAVIS-
On my amazing chariot, riding on top of Buddy, I have a 23.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I'm somehow making more noise than a one man band.
[laughter] Shit.
-LIAM-
Seven.
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
Oh Buddy.
-MATT-
As you "quietly" make your way through the flattened forest, [laughter] the smell of smoke and dirt that has recently been charred is strong in the air as you begin to get close to the edge of the crater, the animal shapes you see seem to notice you, too far away to make out the details, but then they scatter a bit out of sight.
You guys slowly make your way closer and closer to the edge of the crater, some rock formations, you know, higher areas, giving this a bit of a shifting topography but completely stripped of vegetation.
Slowly you come upon the exterior of this crater, you can see it delves down probably about 20 or so feet.
Probably about 30 feet across and there it is before you.
-SAM-
Is there anything inside the crater, any objects?
-MATT-
You want to go up and inspect?
-SAM-
I feel like I should lead from behind.
[laughter] Volunteers?
-ASHLEY-
I'll go.
-LIAM-
I can see everything.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, well yeah.
-SAM-
Yes, you can.
-TALIESIN-
I have the keen owl sight of a bear so I can help as well.
-SAM-
You have the owl sight of a bear, is that what you just said?
-TALIESIN-
Think about it.
Think about it.
[laughter] I wrote down like six of these before the show.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All right, so we have Owlbear--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Buddy.
-LIAM-
Yeah, I'm wearing Eyes of the Eagle.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
I have 30 feet of blind sight.
-MATT-
That's true.
-LAURA-
Were you going to go up, too, Damian?
-ASHLEY-
Well yeah, I was thinking about it but I mean--
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
I want to go down there.
-MARISHA-
You're going up Taryon?
-SAM-
No, I'm fine to just sort of take in the sights from back here, Damian if you're going in though, would you like a little extra bravery or stamina as you go up there?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, of course.
-SAM-
Of course, all right.
-ASHLEY-
I'll take anything.
-SAM-
Do you wear boots, carry a shield, wear a hat, wear a cloak or have any armor?
-ASHLEY-
You can't see my armor, can you?
-SAM-
You're wearing armor?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-SAM-
All right, I will--
-ASHLEY-
It's my suit.
-SAM-
Oh.
It's a power suit.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
That's why I'm wearing it.
[laughter] I'm wearing boots and armor.
-SAM-
I will touch your power suit and imbue it, infuse it with protection against, I don't know, acid? [laughter]
-MATT-
All right, you have acid resistance.
-ASHLEY-
Would that be under this?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Thank you, I feel exactly the same.
[laughter] But maybe that's something that like kicks in later.
-SAM-
Sure.
-ASHLEY-
You feel it in the moment.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
-MARISHA-
Who all is going up? The Owlbear and--
-MATT-
The three of them, I think.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Technically, are you still riding on the back of Buddy?
-LIAM-
Mac, stay low.
-TRAVIS-
What?
-SAM-
What?
-ASHLEY-
I think he said stay low.
-LIAM-
A giant ogre hand reaches up and slowly pushes the halfling down the chariot.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
(screaming)
-SAM-
Before they go, I will touch Buddy's head, his hat, his flaps and infuse it with, making it a helm of telepathy so now he can detect thoughts.
-LIAM-
(surprised grunt) [laughter]
-MATT-
Sure.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Stop! Stop! [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
(screams)
-MATT-
Is he having a Superman moment with like all the voices at once? [laughter]
-LIAM-
The critters! Does it go in all directions, everyone around?
-SAM-
No, you have to cast it, you just have access to that spell once.
-MATT-
Okay.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Like the cat with the bread on its head.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Before The Owlbear takes off, I will give him a bardic inspiration.
-TALIESIN-
Cool.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, all right. How much is that, I don't actually--
-MARISHA-
You get 1d10 whenever you want to use it.
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'm going to keep that right there.
-LAURA-
I'll just stand here next to Tary, really, really close so that his hair blows in the breeze that's coming from me.
-SAM-
Is that coming from you?
-LAURA-
Oh well, I just thought it made you look more powerful.
-SAM-
Uh, yeah! [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Cool preview.
-SAM-
Want you by my side at all times.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
All right, the three of you, technically four, carrying Macaroni in tow, make your way a little further in, coming to the lip of the crater.
I'd like you all to make perception checks, please.
-TALIESIN-
A which?
-MATT-
Perception.
-TALIESIN-
Perception.
-TRAVIS-
Nine.
-TALIESIN-
Nine.
[AUDIENCE SHOUTS NEIN]
-LIAM-
Nine.
-LAURA-
What?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'll use that d10.
-ASHLEY-
16.
-TALIESIN-
14.
-MATT-
Okay.
Looking within the crater, you do notice, first off, there is an impact place at the bottom, though, whatever impacted here is either completely annihilated or is no longer here.
Both Owlbear and Damian notice that the impact zone here based on the remnants of a handful of burnt feathers and the ash like shadows that have been seared into some of the nearby rocks, the impact zone here was once a duck pond.
-LAURA-
(laughs) [groaning]
-TRAVIS-
That's fucking dark.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
Oh no, his dreams!
-TALIESIN-
It should've been a goose.
[laughter] They have less to live for.
[laughter]
-MATT-
You immediately glance back and notice that for most of this journey, Lionel's been like clutching his stomach a bit and not like he's been feeling well. It's like his totem can sense--
-SAM-
Oh no.
-MATT-
--the terror that has transpired in the night.
-TRAVIS-
The disturbance in the force?
-MATT-
Yeah, the duck force.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I walk up to Lionel, I put my hand on his shoulder.
That thing you're feeling right now in the pit of your stomach--
-MATT-
"Yeah?"
-TALIESIN-
I need you to use it.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-TALIESIN-
Harness it.
[laughter] We're going to find what did this.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-TALIESIN-
And you'll have your revenge.
-TRAVIS-
No.
-ASHLEY-
I love it so much.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-MATT-
"Revenge for what?" [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Should I have waited, was this way too early? I don't know.
Thought we were--
-MATT-
"I don't know" and he walks up to the edge of the crater and goes, "What did you-- no!" [laughter] And just falls to his knees screaming.
-TALIESIN-
That feeling right there.
[laughter] Yeah.
-MATT-
He stands up.
"(sobbing, whimpering)"
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-MATT-
"(growling)"
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
He rages, you've noticed for the first time since you've known him, this is not a happy rage.
[groaning]
-SAM-
I step back, Doty, protect me.
-MATT-
Doty pushes Hazel in front of you.
[laughter, cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Oh god.
-MARISHA-
It is an honor, my captain.
Pleasure to be chosen.
-LIAM-
Try the Color Spray.
-SAM-
What did you discover, just dead things, feathers?
-MATT-
You, however, because of your high perception-- the rest of you gathered a little bit-- you've been looking a bit further. You see a handful of glittering slivers at the bottom of this crater and you also notice there is a track of something heavy that had been dragged out of it heading in a southeast direction.
-ASHLEY-
Southeast?
-MATT-
Mm hm.
-TALIESIN-
Is it time to take a look at this, maybe?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to jump down.
(jumping noise)
-MATT-
You land in the center.
-TALIESIN-
I hide.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Roll a stealth check.
-TALIESIN-
24.
-MATT-
24.
[laughter] You threw yourself against the edge of the crater, throw a bit of ash over the back of your shoulder and you know what, yeah, not bad.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
I go over--
-MARISHA-
Are you doing anything else?
-TALIESIN-
Not yet.
[laughter] See what happens.
-TRAVIS-
Time to do this.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to slowly start making my way to the center of the crater.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
We all just stare.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
It's more in the middle, it's weird how you're walking along-- that's okay.
I walk over to Taryon, Farriwen and--
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
--Hazel. Yeah, so it looks like there's some shiny stuff down there, like shiny slivers of something and then--
-SAM-
Big, small?
-ASHLEY-
Perspective is weird when you're standing up on a thing and looking down at it. It could be big, could be small.
-MARISHA-
Intriguing.
-ASHLEY-
And there's some tracks where it looks like something was dragged.
-SAM-
Oh, which direction?
-ASHLEY-
Southeast.
[laughter] Yeah, I...
it's a compass.
-SAM-
Oh.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
That's really smart.
-SAM-
Owlbear, bring some of those slivers back when you come out of the crater.
-TALIESIN-
Let me know what I see when I'm about 30 feet away.
-MATT-
Well, you're in the crater.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm in the crater.
-MATT-
Which is about 30 feet across.
-TALIESIN-
Perfect.
[laughter] That's all I needed.
-MATT-
So the minute you enter the crater and hide--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You glance over your shoulder.
[laughter] You can see-- [laughter] Three quarter to dime sized flakes of some sort of a opalescent rock.
-TALIESIN-
All right, slowly walk over and not going to touch them, I'm just going to use one of my knives to inspect it.
-MATT-
Okay.
For as dirty and ashy as the space is here, they are very smooth and very clear. As you lift it up a little bit and inspect it you can see there's like a very, very faint soft light that it just generates, very, very faint but just enough in this shaded space as the sun has been setting, you can very easily see that its generating its own bit of light.
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'm going to scoop it up and I'm going to empty my tinder box. I'm going to scoop them into my tinder box without touching them.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
Box them up and I'm going to run up to the side of the crater right back to everybody.
-MATT-
Make an acrobatics check.
-TALIESIN-
I have easy climb.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, you do. Yeah, you're fine.
[laughter]
-SAM-
Thank you, Owlbear.
I'll open the box and look.
-MATT-
You see the same shards that he found. They're beautiful and give this low light and you can tell that the way they're broken, as you work with gems and such in creating objects and magical items, these appear to have flaked off something larger.
-MARISHA-
Taryon opens the box to reveal a magical gem filled with splendor and wonder.
[laughter]
-SAM-
I pick one up and look at it closer.
-MARISHA-
He picks one up and he looks at it closer.
-MATT-
It's very beautiful.
-SAM-
I don't know what this is, but it seems to have come from an object from the sky.
Whatever we're dealing with might be extra-planetoid.
[laughter] Extra planetary.
Alien in nature.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, like it came down here from another-- another planet.
-SAM-
It could be, yes.
-LAURA-
Sounds dangerous.
-SAM-
Danger is not my middle name.
-SAM-
Gary is.
[laughter]
-MATT-
"That's true."
-TRAVIS-
So if something came and crossed here, where did it go? Did it leave?
-SAM-
We need to find tracks and trace it.
-ASHLEY-
Is anyone good at inspecting tracks or anything like that?
-MATT-
"(growling)"
-SAM-
Didn't you say there was some tracks?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I saw them, but I don't know, you know.
-MARISHA-
A strange rumbling noise comes from the distance.
-SAM-
What is that, what is it, what's going on?
-MATT-
You turn, at this moment you're having this conversation, you begin to hear this growling sound, this snarling.
(snarling)
-ASHLEY-
Did you bring your rescue dogs? [laughter]
-MATT-
You look up ahead, and as the last bit of the setting sun vanishes behind the mountains--
-MARISHA-
Buddy?
-MATT-
-- the forest edges, you can see some of those animal creatures that you previously had scared off seem to have returned only much closer sight, much bigger than you anticipated.
Wolven in body, but swollen in shape, maybe eight to 10 feet from foot to shoulder, red burning eyes, bony spurs coming out of it, it's a dire wolf and you're like, "Oh, dire wolves, these aren't too bad."
-SAM-
No.
-MATT-
One of them comes forward and goes like, "(snarling)." You see like a faint bit of that glow, that glow that the shards had, embedded in its head, like under an eye and as it snarls, its head splits open (gasping) and a weird little tendril like (slurping).
(gasping)
-MARISHA-
"Stay back!" Taryon exclaimed.
[laughter] (laughter) (applause) "I will smite you where you stand!" he bolstered.
-SAM-
Yes, this is great stuff.
[laughter]
-MATT-
As you all get in a circle back to back at the approaching creatures, they've prepared themselves to lunge and assault your traveling band.
Right as they leap, we're going to take a break.
(groaning) (applause) (tambourine jingling) All righty, friends and folks, this very curious adventure is definitely kicking off.
We'll be back here in a little bit after taking a short break, restroom break, any other break you want to take in the meantime.
Go ahead and enjoy yourselves.
We're going to do the same and we'll see you here shortly.
-GLEN-
Hey, what's up, Critters. It's Glen with OSD.
I just wanted to send y'all a thank you message and my gratitude for all the hard work so far this month.
The Critters thus far have raised enough money to be able to impact over 400 veterans.
We're here in our warehouse, we're putting together additional supply drops for our troops overseas including a million cups of coffee, video games, lots of board games as you can see, as well as putting together different supplies for our chapters that they're doing out in the local community.
Whether it's under privileged kids, it's the homeless, all these different things we're being able to make happen for veterans, by veterans, and with veterans because we know that service to one's community is so gosh darn important.
So thank you again. If you want to continue to support, visit critrole.com/osd, that's critrole.com/osd.
We've still got half the month to go.
So if we've hit 400 now, let's push it.
Let's try to do 800 and let's really make a difference as we head through Thanksgiving, into Christmas and into 2020. Thank you again! (light electronic music) TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.
-BRIAN-
What the fuck?! Where have you been, man?
-TRAVIS-
Hey yes, it worked, no more spooky ranch, fuck! No more pissing my pants. Bless you, Minnesota Jones! You furry little saint!
-BRIAN-
Yeah, that fucker re-realmported me here without you.
This place is a little fucking weird, man.
It seems a little early for the holidays, if you ask me, you know, but, I don't know.
-MERRY-
What discarded lump of coal said that? It's never too early for the holidays.
-TRAVIS-
Is that a dinosaur?
-BRIAN-
What the fuck? I swear, dude, this shit is getting fucking old, man.
-MERRY-
You can call me by my travel name, Merry Sugarplum!
-BRIAN-
The fuck? This critter has two names, man, I can't fucking do this anymore. This is getting excessive.
-MERRY-
Well, why don't you kick the bucket, you cheer-siphoning convict? (laughter)
-BRIAN-
That was--
-TRAVIS-
I'm sorry, Rachel, I mean, Merry Sugarplum.
Where are you on vacation from?
-MERRY-
Well, Yee-Haw Prehistoric Ranch, of course.
-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MERRY-
My family comes here every year to celebrate the great calling of the Ov.
-BRIAN-
The fuck, you're from the Prehistoric Ranch? What that's place like?
-MERRY-
Have y'all ever been to Jungle Ranch?
-MERRY-
Basically that shit, but with dinosaurs... like me! (laughter)
-BRIAN-
Wow, the Ov really built a compelling and unique world, it sounds like.
-MERRY-
Well, you are built like a 13-year old skateboarder who sells cigarettes under bleachers.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-BRIAN-
That's not untrue.
-TRAVIS-
You got arrested for that, didn't you?
-BRIAN-
Twice.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) Hey, Sugarplum, I don't, if you don't mind, we usually get a little download when we first arrive to these new realms.
Anything we need to know about this snow-covered, festive place?
-MERRY-
Mm-hmm! Be merry, bring joy to others, and most importantly, refuse the game soul.
-BRIAN-
That's cool.
Wait, <i>refuse</i> the game soul? That's like against everything.
-MERRY-
(humming "Jingle Bells")
-TRAVIS-
Please don't be [inaudible].
Quad kill, come and get some!
-BRIAN-
Congrats.
-TRAVIS-
Thanks, buddy.
-BRIAN-
Yeah, let's see what this is about.
-TRAVIS-
What are you in?
-BRIAN-
Man, it was in the--
-TRAVIS-
Are you in the attack helicopter?
-BRIAN-
Yeah, I'm just going to go ahead and-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, the controls are kind of inverted. No, I'm just bad.
-TRAVIS-
Are we winning?
-BRIAN-
We're winning this fight.
-TRAVIS-
I think we're losing.
-BRIAN-
Nah, we're winning, man.
-TRAVIS-
Oof!
-BRIAN-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, okay.
Oh! (laughs) That was good.
-BRIAN-
You got him!
-TRAVIS-
That was just a hail mary.
Oh, that's fucking great, what's up?
-BRIAN-
If only Dak Prescott could nail those as well as you do.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
Victory!
-BRIAN-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Boom!
-BRIAN-
No way!
-TRAVIS-
Santa owned your ass!
-BRIAN-
Oh, I should take it out of the plastic before I--
-TRAVIS-
Is it fucking snowing right now?
-BRIAN-
A lot of people think maybe I'm not as good as I say that I am based on how they saw me play against those bots, but I guarantee you I'm far better.
-TRAVIS-
Huh.
-BRIAN-
Do you want to have a duel with these? Do you want to come up to the middle and we'll turn our backs to each other and--
-TRAVIS-
Like Hamilton?
-BRIAN-
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, wait.
-BRIAN-
Where are you, where are you?
-TRAVIS-
I'm coming up near the house.
-BRIAN-
Right here, right here.
-TRAVIS-
Where, where?
-BRIAN-
Okay, yeah, stay on the other side of the pond, stay on the other side of the pond.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, you got to look away.
-BRIAN-
Okay, so wait, wait. Yeah, stay where you're going to be.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, here.
-BRIAN-
Stay where you're going to be.
-TRAVIS-
I'm turning away.
-BRIAN-
No, stay--
-TRAVIS-
I'm turning away.
-BRIAN-
Okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
You fucking-- don't-- said-- you.
(gunfire) (laughter) I saw you!
-BRIAN-
I will probably be the last man standing.
(explosion) (laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Not only did that work, but I killed myself at the same time because I had to come around the corner and look like a dumb ass.
-BRIAN-
Goddamn, this game's fun. Okay, this is match point.
I'm not joking.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-BRIAN-
Come out here to the center.
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-BRIAN-
See if you can jump over this thing.
-TRAVIS-
Like this?
-BRIAN-
Yeah, okay.
So on the count of three--
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-BRIAN-
Let's jump and see if we can shoot each other in the head.
-TRAVIS-
One--
-BRIAN-
Wait, wait, wait.
-TRAVIS-
Jump on three? Yes.
-BRIAN-
Jump and shoot on three.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-BRIAN-
One.
-TRAVIS-
Two.
-BRIAN-
Two, three.
(gunfire)
-BRIAN-
Wait, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Okay, one.
-TRAVIS-
Two.
-BRIAN-
Two, three.
(gunfire) You've got an automatic weapon! One, two, three.
(gunfire) Fuck you, fuck you.
(laughter) (gunfire and laughter) (dramatic Western music) (upbeat music)
-WILL-
Hey everyone, the insanely talented Will Friedle here.
I'm excited to announce that I have a new late night talk show coming to the Critical Role YouTube channel on Wednesdays called Mini Primetime.
It's brought to you by the same creators as that one show with the hippy kid with the bracelets, whatever that is.
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime, is a mini painting show for beginners and veterans alike where this handsome face teaches the Critical Role cast how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques.
Fades, small detail work and taking your mini to the next level by adding your base.
So look for us soon on Critical Role's YouTube.
Critical Role, what is that? What is even a Critical Role? Oh, that's right, that was the show with Kash.
(upbeat music)
-LIAM-
Subscribe or don't subscribe.
That's not a question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to ponder the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime.
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters who find they can't afford them? To play.
To sleep no more.
And a sleep to say the cast and crew of Crit'cal Role might find their naps around the hectic schedule of a live broadcast that we have brought for your consumption, both Critter and fan alike.
To play or sleep.
(chuckles) No sleep, but just to stream.
Aye, there's the rub.
For with your subscription what streams may come? Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tag line.
Do we got that? Oh, that is Twitch poetry.
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe, gift some subscriptions, you got it.
Wrong soliloquy for this skull, but that's fucking good.
(classical music)
-MATT-
Hello everyone and welcome back.
[cheering] Glad you enjoyed your break, I'm pretty sure we enjoyed ours.
Our brief stops to the restroom.
But without further ado, let's jump back into the story which we left off with snarling beasts that seem to be awkwardly changed by the nature of whatever befell this part of the Cyrengreen.
As you rounded up, they leapt.
I'll be right back with a battle map.
[cheering]
-LIAM-
He was here for a split second!
-MARISHA-
I know, I know, I know, I know.
-LIAM-
Oh god! [cheering] Oh god!
-ASHLEY-
Hey, it was back lit all weird! [laughter] Sports!
-ALL-
Whoa!
-SAM-
Whoa, that's so cool, Matt!
-LIAM-
Tunguska!
-MATT-
Very much the inspiration for this.
-TALIESIN-
Oh wow.
-SAM-
Oh, Matt.
Is that like coffee grinds all over it or something?
-MATT-
It's black ballast material, you can get it at all sorts of hobby shops.
-SAM-
Wow.
-MATT-
All right, so--
-SAM-
Can you snort it?
-MATT-
Uh-- You can? [laughter] But you could snort a lot of things.
-MATT-
Spice, you can do.
All right, so do you guys have a preference of where you're laid out before I place the creatures?
-TRAVIS-
I just want to be on Buddy.
-MATT-
You got it.
-TRAVIS-
Woo hoo!
-LAURA-
Aw, that's so cute!
-MATT-
There we go.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-LAURA-
I was standing next to Taryon, wherever he is.
-MATT-
Taryon, where are you?
-SAM-
I'll probably be up a little on that higher ledge.
-MATT-
There you go.
-SAM-
A little perspective.
-MATT-
All right, Doty next to you?
-SAM-
Please, yes and yes, yes.
-MARISHA-
And I'll be on the other side of Doty.
-SAM-
(like Hazel) Ha ha!
-MARISHA-
Ha ha!
-TALIESIN-
I had just gotten out of the pit.
-MATT-
So you'd be probably over here.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, like right next to them, yeah.
-MATT-
All right, Farriwen?
-LAURA-
I was actually standing next to Taryon.
-SAM-
Oh man, we're all clumped, that's perfect for dying.
-LAURA-
Yeah, it's great, isn't it? [laughter]
-MATT-
It's going to be great.
-LIAM-
Those minis are gorgeous!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I was kind of-- [cheering] I turned around to tell them what was going on, so I think I'm next to The Owlbear.
-MATT-
At the edge there.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All righty, and then I'm going to say that Lionel's been dragging a bit behind since his duck senses have been flapping so hard.
-SAM-
Duck senses.
-MATT-
I need you all to roll initiative.
[cheering]
-MARISHA-
Ho ho ho! Bad!
-SAM-
Terrible.
-ASHLEY-
Bad, bad.
-LAURA-
Same. Terrible.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-LAURA-
Ow!
-MATT-
All righty, let me roll for these guys here.
Oh, yeah, okay.
25 to 20?
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-MARISHA-
Woo hoo hoo!
-MATT-
20 to 15?
-TALIESIN-
15.
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
Oh boy.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Oh boy, those are your initials, Owlbear.
[laughter] 15 to 10?
-TRAVIS-
14!
-MATT-
All right, wow!
-ASHLEY-
I rolled a 10, I rolled a 10.
-MATT-
10 for Damian.
-ASHLEY-
I'm still in that group.
-MATT-
10 to five?
-LIAM-
Seven.
-LAURA-
Seven.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
I'm as fast as a monk.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Five to one.
-SAM-
Oh, I'm sorry. Seven. Seven for me and Doty.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
So Buddy, Farriwen, Tary at seven, right?
-MATT-
All right.
-MARISHA-
Four!
-MATT-
All righty, holding up the rear we have Hazel.
I don't know why I started sounding like a strip club DJ there for a second.
(laughter) [inaudible] It's Hazel!
-TRAVIS-
Welcome to the stage.
-LIAM-
Now on stage three, now on stage three.
-MATT-
Can't make enough gold out of adventuring.
-LAURA-
What was your initiative?
-MATT-
Anyway.
-ASHLEY-
10.
-MATT-
First up--
-MARISHA-
Woo hoo hoo!
-MATT-
-- are the creatures.
-TRAVIS-
First up, yeah.
-MATT-
Rolled really high.
[dramatic music]
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
No, less, less! I said less!
-LIAM-
Less is more, Matthew.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-LAURA-
They're really big.
-MATT-
All right, as they shift over--
-MARISHA-
Oh goodness.
-MATT-
It is rough terrain, so all movement through here is halved.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
25, that puts them into contact with you, Owlbear.
Two of them.
-SAM-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
Damn it.
-MATT-
Against you, Owlbear.
-SAM-
(like The Owlbear) How can they see you? [laughter]
-MATT-
Oh god.
-SAM-
Oh god.
-ASHLEY-
See, when we saw these things from far away, they looked so much smaller.
It's weird, you know, like I was saying about perspective, you get up close and it's--
-MATT-
It's funny how it works out that way.
All righty, so two of them are attacking you, Owlbear.
-TALIESIN-
Right.
-MATT-
That has pack tactics, so they have advantage on their rolls because there are two of them against you.
That brings it to a 15 to hit?
-TALIESIN-
Does not hit.
-MATT-
You duck out of the way of its bite.
The other one with advantage.
That's going to be a 26 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
That hits.
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
(like The Owlbear) Take a bite out of crime.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god! Did you just McGruff?
-MATT-
That is 14 points of piercing damage.
-TALIESIN-
Goddamn it.
-MATT-
And I need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-TALIESIN-
I do not get any of my special strength stuff yet, do I?
-MATT-
No, because you're not raging yet.
-SAM-
Damn it.
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
Strength saving throw?
-MATT-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
19.
-MATT-
Okay, it tries to grab your leg and it's biting into it and you can feel the pain and you manage to wrestle it out of its jaws before it drags you to the ground.
Attacking you, Buddy.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
That is going to be a 15 to hit?
-LIAM-
No.
-MATT-
15, you just kick its head out of the way, no issue.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
Then attacking you, Farriwen.
That is going to be another 26 to hit.
-SAM-
Farriwen, you just got hit by a 26.
-LAURA-
Oh, for me! Oh yeah, that hits.
-MATT-
(laughs) Ooh!
-MARISHA-
We were monk chatting.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
There you go, 19 points of piercing damage.
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
And I need you to make a strength saving throw, please.
-LAURA-
Yeah, that's what I was commenting on is how weak I am.
So that's unfortunate that it's strength saves.
Well, you know.
-MATT-
You can't be good at everything.
-SAM-
(Irish accent) Well, you know.
-LAURA-
Natural 20.
[cheering]
-MATT-
No worries.
It goes to bite towards you and you actually grab the edge of its snout and just push it away.
That brings us to Owlbear.
At the top of your turn--
-TALIESIN-
Yes.
-MATT-
As these creatures are snarling around you, the one that's face had split, its jaw still hangs open, that one tendril (slurping) whipping out. You look to the other one and you see where its eyes are burning towards you, two more eyes, (popping) and pop out at odd angles in the head.
I need you to go ahead and make, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
Nope, nope, nope.
Nope.
-TALIESIN-
Seven.
[laughter]
-MATT-
You are frightened until the end--
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Oh shit.
Okay.
-MATT-
-- of this creature's next turn.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, which one?
-MATT-
That would be-- well, I guess roll for this one now, too.
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Oh no.
[laughter]
-MATT-
So roll again.
That would be this one.
-TALIESIN-
Wisdom saving throw?
-MATT-
Yep, now you're rolling for this one.
-TALIESIN-
Ah, that's better, 16.
-MATT-
Okay. So this is the one that you're frightened of.
-TALIESIN-
Okay.
Well.
-LAURA-
Zoinks.
-TALIESIN-
I would like to rage.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Yes! [laughter] [cheering]
-TALIESIN-
(growling)
-TRAVIS-
Holy shit.
-MATT-
You fucker.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
It's actually really comfortable there.
-SAM-
So intimidating.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
It's the most intimidating felt I could find.
[laughter] Okay. I am going to make a-- I definitely do not have advantage on either of these two so I will make a reckless attack on the one on the ground, I suppose.
-MATT-
Okay, go for it.
You have disadvantage on these attacks because you are frightened, but you have advantage-- well no, you were just in a frightened status.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I'm in the frightened state.
-MATT-
Which means you have disadvantage on attacks while that creature's in your line of sight.
But you took reckless, which means it's just a regular attack roll.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, does raging do anything to fear?
-MATT-
Not your base of rage, no.
-TALIESIN-
Not my version, all right.
Take my regular attacks, then.
Let's take two attacks, come on.
Oh yeah, that's-- (exhales) 22 and (counting) 27, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay, both hit.
-MARISHA-
Oh yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah, <i>oh yeah.</i> Where's my, see I'm hitting these with my claws.
So--
-SAM-
Claws?
-TRAVIS-
I want you to talk in your character voice the whole time.
-TALIESIN-
All the time.
First attack has sneak attack damage.
-MATT-
No sneak attack, because it is not in melee with another ally of your and you do not have advantage on attack.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I don't technically have advantage.
Oh man.
-MATT-
Sorry, buddy.
-TALIESIN-
That's fine, I'll take it.
-LIAM-
That's my name.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Sorry, Buddy.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Five.
13, 14, 15, 16, 17 points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice.
Macaroni, you're on deck.
-TALIESIN-
And I used my bonus action rage, and-- [laughter] I, yeah, I can't--
-SAM-
(laughs) I just heard that.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I can't really move without getting two more attacks on me, can I?
-MATT-
Nope!
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'll hold, that's fine.
-MATT-
Okay, that finishes your go, Macaroni, you're up with Damian on deck.
-TRAVIS-
It's such a stupid name.
-MATT-
I know.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
We all told you.
-SAM-
Would you prefer Mr. Samsonite?
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Macaroni's good.
-LIAM-
Only if you're nasty.
-TRAVIS-
I'll see all of these things coming out of the forest, I'm like: Ah, Buddy, we got to be able to move! And I will cast Freedom of Movement on Buddy.
-MATT-
All righty.
[cheering]
-TRAVIS-
With my bonus action I will cast Sacred Flame at one of the little wolf people.
-MATT-
Sacred Flame as a bonus action?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I have it as a cantrip.
-MATT-
Cantrip, but is it an action or a bonus action?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, it's a action. Well, fuck.
-MATT-
Sorry.
-TALIESIN-
I could take a heal--
-TRAVIS-
With my bonus action, I'm like: Move, bitch! And that's it.
-MATT-
There you go.
You're staying put on top of Buddy?
-TRAVIS-
Yes, staying put.
-MATT-
You got it.
All right, finishing Macaroni's, it is now Damian's turn with Taryon, Doty, Farriwen, and Buddy on deck.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so I'm going to touch my lapel and I'm going to activate a hill rune.
-MATT-
Which actually, at the top of your turn, no, because you're not right next to one, never mind, go, continue.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to activate a hill rune.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Which is a bonus action where I gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing.
-MATT-
Nice.
-ASHLEY-
Then I'm going to ahead and attack this one in front of me.
-MATT-
Right here?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Let's give him a go.
-MATT-
Move in next to Owlbear to strike.
-ASHLEY-
Come on, okay.
It was cocked, I didn't reroll it.
-MATT-
We got to get you a new d20.
-ASHLEY-
Well, I just, I love it, though.
-MATT-
I know it's really pretty.
-SAM-
Yeah, but it's so bad.
-MATT-
But it is like designed to be a cocked roll like 40% of the time.
-ASHLEY-
I know, but like, all the other percent of the time, sometimes it, like 20% of the time it rolls well.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Fair enough, fair enough.
-ASHLEY-
That'll be a 19 to hit for the first hit.
-MATT-
19 to hit hits.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so.
[dramatic music] That would be a 10 for the first hit.
-MATT-
10 points of damage for the first strike, all righty.
-ASHLEY-
Hold on, I feel like I'm forgetting something.
All right, I'm going to roll again, second attack.
16?
-MATT-
16 hits.
-ASHLEY-
'Kay, let's do this again.
Seven for the second hit.
-MATT-
Seven points of damage in the second hit.
You rush forward and with your blades out, both stilettos, sink one into the side of its chest and then stab the other underneath where its ribcage is and as you pull both out you can see like, the blood gush from each wound and then in each puncture wound, a small, like, weird fleshy finger goes, (slurping) and plugs it.
-ASHLEY-
What the fuck, that's gross.
Second hit, I rolled the wrong thing.
-MATT-
Oh, the wrong die?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 10 is for the second hit.
-MATT-
Gotcha, so it's 10 instead of seven, got it, cool.
That finish your turn?
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-MATT-
All righty, Taryon, Doty, Farriwen, and Buddy.
You guys choose who goes first.
I'll say based on the dexterities, we'll say probably Farriwen.
-LAURA-
All right.
Shite, okay, I'm going to--
What was that? [laughter]
-MATT-
That was the tiniest celebration.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Yay, high dex.
-LAURA-
All right, all right, all right! I'm going to do some monk shit.
-MATT-
Yeah, do it.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-LAURA-
I'm going to leap off of the ledge where I'm standing.
-SAM-
(Irish accent) Leap off of the ledge.
-MATT-
Off this way, you mean?
-LAURA-
Yeah, but I'm going to jump, oh--
-MARISHA-
No, Hazel!
-LAURA-
I'm going to--
-MATT-
Doty rejoices.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
I'm going to partially land on Buddy and then kick off of him and try to take a flying leap down while I'm swinging my dual glaive that I got from Taryon.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit.
-LAURA-
And slash down at the--
-MATT-
This guy there?
-LAURA-
Yeah, that guy right there.
-MATT-
Landing over in this side?
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
All righty, make an acrobatics check for me.
-LAURA-
Oh, oh monk shit comes with a cost.
-MATT-
Cool monk shit like that?
-MARISHA-
You're good, you're good!
-LAURA-
17.
-MATT-
Yeah, that's high enough.
-LAURA-
All right, tight.
-MATT-
So you leap, push past Hazel, jump in the air, grab on temporarily to the top of Buddy's-- [laughter] Oh, we have a follow up celebration!
-LAURA-
I succeeded! [laughter] Ha!
-MATT-
(laughs) [cheering] Leap off that and then land right on top of one of the fallen trees right next to this wolf.
-LAURA-
That definitely succeeds.
-MATT-
It does.
-LAURA-
All right, I'm going to--
-MATT-
By the way, as part of this leap, as you're rushing away from that wolf, he does get an attack opportunity on you.
-LAURA-
Oh, I was right next to one?
-MATT-
Yeah. It attacked you last round.
-LAURA-
Oh, I didn't realize.
-MATT-
Well, now you do, because it hits you with a 24.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
For 14 points of piercing damage.
-LAURA-
That guy's a piece of shite, I don't like him.
-MARISHA-
Cutting Words!
-SAM-
Whoa!
-MARISHA-
Did I do that right?
-MATT-
Okay, go ahead and roll a-- roll your d10.
-LAURA-
What is that? Oh, Cutting Words! I couldn't understand what you were saying, your accent was weird.
-MARISHA-
I've never done a bard! Oh, oh six.
-MATT-
So that brings you to 18. What's your armor class? (groaning)
-LAURA-
18.
-MATT-
Aw, that still hits you.
Make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
And DM, which is the one that bit her, the one that's furthest from you?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Yeah, when she ran from it? Okay.
-LAURA-
Fuck me.
Seven.
-MATT-
Seven.
So that cool moment in your head where you're like, "Oh, this is going to be so rad when I leap off and do this," you go and make that first step and it totally knocks you to the ground.
-ASHLEY-
And kills it.
-MATT-
Kills its own man there, that's fine.
I should probably put other things there, it's okay.
-LAURA-
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
So you can keep going.
Yeah, because it doesn't have Sentinel, whatever.
I'm so used to two people with Sentinel in my party, Jesus Christ.
So you take-- oh, no, you're knocked prone because it's a trip never mind, that's what I was trying to do.
-LAURA-
He got to do that as a reaction, he could do the whole thing as a reaction?
-MATT-
His reaction is his bite attack, which has an ability to trip.
-LAURA-
That sucks, man, sucks for me.
-MATT-
So it trips you on the ground, yeah.
-LAURA-
All right, cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
You can use your movement to get back up, if you want.
-LAURA-
Does it cancel the attack I just did or would it--
-MATT-
The attack you just did would probably go to him, I'd say, if you wanted to attack.
-LAURA-
Okay, so did it land, then, against him or do I need to reroll?
-MATT-
What'd you roll again? It was--
-LAURA-
I rolled 19 plus 10.
-MATT-
Yeah, that would hit.
-LAURA-
All right, then in my head I was spinning my dual glaive that I got from Tary, but I ended up hitting this thing that knocked me down instead, all right.
-MATT-
Right, are you using half your movement to get up before the attack?
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
Are you using half your movement to get up before the attack?
-LAURA-
Yes, I am after I hit him.
-MATT-
Okay, just double checking.
Okay, that's disadvantage on the first attack, then.
-LAURA-
Because I'm on the ground?
-MATT-
Because you're on the ground, unless you want to get up first.
-LAURA-
I'll get up first.
-MATT-
That's what I was asking, just getting some clarity here.
All right.
-LAURA-
Jeez.
-SAM-
Monk shit.
-LAURA-
Monk shit.
So that's 13, oh wait, I'm going to use my ki point and I'm going to fucking Stunning Strike him.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
Stunning Strike on that?
-LAURA-
Yeah, so it's 13 points of damage and then I'm going for a Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
Got it.
16?
-LAURA-
Just what he needed.
-MATT-
Yeah, so he succeeds and resists it, unfortunately.
-LAURA-
You know what, that's fine.
-MATT-
Got your next attack, though.
-LAURA-
My next attack, I'm going to hit him again with my dual glaive as well.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-LAURA-
All right, cool.
I spin in the air and down. 18?
-MATT-
18 hits.
-LAURA-
Yeah! All right, that is 11 points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice.
-LAURA-
Then, Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
Go for it, two more strikes.
With your unarmed attack.
-LAURA-
18.
-MATT-
18 hits.
-LAURA-
And the other one doesn't hit, I'm assuming, for 12.
-MATT-
12 does not hit.
-LAURA-
All right.
That's good, 10 additional points.
-MATT-
10 additional points, nice.
All righty.
That finishes your turn?
-LAURA-
That's all I got.
-SAM-
That's a lot.
-MATT-
All right.
That brings us to, your dexterity is 11. Buddy, what's your dexterity?
-LIAM-
14.
-MATT-
Okay, Buddy goes first.
At first, though, Buddy, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.
-LIAM-
For what?
-MATT-
The frightening appearance of this creature.
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
All right.
[cheering] You've seen this plenty of times, you're fine.
What do you do on your turn?
-LIAM-
Well, he just got Freedom of Movement cast on him and he's already a good jumper so he goes, (growling and clapping) and he starts hopping up and down and bounces around to the backside of this thing.
-MATT-
On this side?
-LIAM-
No, the wolf between him and the hole.
-SAM-
So like over here?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Over here?
-LIAM-
No.
-MATT-
This way?
-LIAM-
Split the diff.
-MATT-
This way?
-LIAM-
No.
There we go.
-MATT-
Gotcha.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
He's going to shove the monster in the hole.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
You are pretty! [laughter]
-SAM-
Everybody's pretty.
-MATT-
Everyone, seeing everything for the first time, it makes sense.
-ASHLEY-
This is Sparta.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
This is Darrington! [cheering]
-MATT-
All righty, double checking the shove action.
All right.
That's your melee attack?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So yeah, go ahead and roll an attack.
Oh no, instead of making an attack, you make a strength athletics check.
-LIAM-
Athletics?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
19.
-MATT-
That's nine.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
As you run around and then slam the side of this weird, mutated wolf, it (whimpering) and then tumbles off down into the crater, prone.
(thudding)
-LIAM-
That's it.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Nice job, Buddy.
-MATT-
All right, finishing your turn, that brings us to Taryon and Doty.
-SAM-
I will say: Doty, make me proud. And command him on my bonus action to go attack that wolf down a step from him.
-MATT-
Okay.
-SAM-
He swings.
-MATT-
So go ahead and roll an attack for him.
-SAM-
Oh yeah, 19 plus like, 19 plus four, 23.
-MATT-
23 definitely hits.
-SAM-
Okay, 1d8 plus two, so that's four points of damage, but I am going to add an Arcane Jolt to his attack adding 4d6 damage.
-MATT-
Nice, 4d6 force damage.
-SAM-
Okay.
15 more points of damage, so that's 19 points total.
-MATT-
Nice.
-SAM-
Then for my movement, I will hop on the broom and fly down to The Owlbear.
-LAURA-
That broom is really amazing.
-SAM-
Yes, you should get one.
It's fantastic.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
And I will cast Heroism on The Owlbear, he needs it.
[laughter] You gain four extra hit points, no big deal, but you're immune to fear.
-ASHLEY-
Oh yeah.
[cheering]
-MATT-
Is that concentration?
-SAM-
It is concentration.
-MATT-
All right, good to know.
-SAM-
Okay.
Do I fall to my death?
-MATT-
No.
-SAM-
Okay, good.
-MATT-
You're fine, you're fine.
Does that finish your turn then?
-SAM-
Actually, you get four extra hit points at the start of <i>each</i> of your turns.
-MATT-
Oh, so he just keeps healing.
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
Nice!
-TALIESIN-
That's amazing.
-SAM-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
Finishing their go, that brings us to Lionel.
Lionel's going to go ahead and leap up half his movement to get up to this side, push through and go ahead and join next to Farriwen against this other beast on the tall part of the platform, pulling his greatsword out going, "You stay away from my new friends!" That's going to be a-- that hits.
Second attack, also hits.
-LAURA-
Yeah!
-ASHLEY-
Get him!
-MATT-
Oh, he might would have raged beforehand.
I can do that, I'm the DM.
(laughter) He rolled double ones in the attack, which is not great, but that's okay, that's still a decent amount.
Second attack, that's better, a five and a six on that.
Oof! That guy's looking real rough already.
That's going to finish Lionel's turn.
That brings us to Hazel.
-MARISHA-
All right.
Everyone sees me slap in another wax cylinder into my belt.
I adjust my audiophone.
The Darrington Brigade, with great resolve, leap into combat! With great force, The Owlbear flashes in a brilliant display of might and fury! And I cast Pyrotech-neics on The Owlbear.
-TRAVIS-
What's that accent?
-LAURA-
I don't know!
-MARISHA-
You know.
-TRAVIS-
"Pyrotech-neics." [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
It's getting the job done, I don't know what you're doing yet.
-LIAM-
(old time radio announcer voice) The year was 1943, the place was Tal'Dorei.
-MATT-
All righty.
[laughter] So you're-- Are you creating smoke or fireworks?
-MARISHA-
I am creating fireworks.
-MATT-
All righty, what's your spell DC?
-MARISHA-
17.
-MATT-
17, all right.
Both of those--
-MARISHA-
Within 10 feet, it's 10 feet.
-MATT-
All creatures, exactly.
So I need--
-MARISHA-
Constitution save.
-MATT-
I need Doty and Damian to make constitution saving throws.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, it's okay.
-MATT-
That's a fail on that wolf.
A fail on both wolves. They are both blinded on that side.
-LAURA-
Nice.
-SAM-
I will, wait, who's making saving throws?
-MATT-
You.
-SAM-
Oh shit.
[laughter] Well then, as my reaction, I will-- I don't know if I can do this-- I will Flash My Genius at myself.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Sure.
-SAM-
I will take a glimpse--
-MATT-
I'm not even going to check the rules, you're Taryon Darrington, I'll let you do it.
[cheering]
-SAM-
I'm going to check the shine of my armor and I can see a reflection of my face and it inspires me and gives me an extra four points.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
This is a what kind of save?
-SAM-
Okay, that's a 20, then.
-MARISHA-
You're good, yeah, you're good.
-MATT-
You're good.
-ASHLEY-
Natural 20.
[cheering]
-LAURA-
Nice.
-MARISHA-
And with great fury, The Owlbear bursts forth as sparks fly from his wings as he looks toward the dire wolves in incredible anger.
-TALIESIN-
(growling)
-MARISHA-
(clicking)
-MATT-
All right, it's now the beginning of their turn again.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
The two that are blinded.
Man.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Well, this one down here is going to use half its movement to get up.
It's going to use the rest of its movement to get back up here and that's all it can do. So it's locked in to you, Buddy.
Those two are going to stay put because they're blinded and shaking their head and snapping at whatever sound. This one's going to be attacking you, Damian.
One's attacking you, Owlbear, and the one up top there is going to go ahead and circle around on top, it's going to attack Lionel.
-LAURA-
Whoa.
-MATT-
So the one, two attacking you.
All right, so Owlbear?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That is going to be a--
-LAURA-
(like The Owlbear) Yeah.
Yeah.
-MATT-
15.
-TALIESIN-
Nope.
-MATT-
All right, attacking you, Damian.
It's going to be a 13.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-MATT-
Freaking blind.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Attacking you, Buddy.
That's going to be a 24 to hit.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You suffer...
15 points of piercing damage and make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-LIAM-
Okay.
19.
-MATT-
It bites your foot and tries to drag you, but you're just too heavy and too big and it more just tickles and annoys you.
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Then attacking Lionel up there.
That hits.
-SAM-
Oh.
(dramatic music)
-MATT-
16 points of damage to Lionel.
(dramatic music) There we go.
-SAM-
Remember, Owlbear, I've given you Heroism.
You're not just some renegade anymore.
You're a superhero.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-TALIESIN-
I'm Super Owlbear.
-MATT-
And Lionel is knocked prone.
-SAM-
Lionel's knocked prone?
-MATT-
He's like, "Whoa, that's bad, that's really bad."
-SAM-
Oh no.
-MATT-
"Boss, boss?" All right, that ends their go.
Top of the combat round now is Owlbear, you heal four points.
-TALIESIN-
Heal four points.
-MATT-
And you are no longer afraid.
-TALIESIN-
No longer afraid. Do I have advantage on either of these two?
-MATT-
You don't have advantage, unless you want to attack recklessly, but you are currently in melee, or Damian's in melee with this one who's blinded.
Actually, you do have an advantage on both of them regardless because they're blinded, so yes you do.
-TALIESIN-
Well, the one that's taken the most damage, I'll attack first.
-MATT-
Okay, that would be this one.
-TALIESIN-
Right.
-ASHLEY-
Get him.
-TALIESIN-
Natural 20.
[cheering]
-TRAVIS-
Let's go.
-MATT-
The swan song of the rogue's first strike.
-TALIESIN-
So it's just double dice, right?
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-SAM-
Plus sneak attack?
-TALIESIN-
Plus sneak attack.
-MATT-
Which is also doubled.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-SAM-
Oh.
-TRAVIS-
Is there a brutal critical in there?
-MATT-
He's not high enough level barbarian yet.
Yet.
-TALIESIN-
17 times two, 17--
-LIAM-
34.
-TALIESIN-
27, 17 times--
-LIAM-
Well, 17 times two is 34.
-TALIESIN-
34 plus-- (counting) Nine, 40, 40 points of damage.
[cheering] (growling) As I just stab right into the head.
(growling) The claw.
-MATT-
It has the four eyes that have emerged from its body and you just angrily slam the claws into each one of them.
All the eyes blink out and it screeches before it falls and slumps over into the pit, dead.
-ALL-
Yeah.
[cheering]
-TALIESIN-
I turn to the other one.
(growling) And I attack.
-MATT-
All right, so your bonus action offhand.
-TALIESIN-
No, I've got two attacks per--
-MATT-
Oh, that's right, because barbarian.
-TALIESIN-
Two attacks per attack.
-MATT-
And you have bonus action.
-TALIESIN-
That's 26 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits.
-TALIESIN-
It's not going to do nearly as much damage, but still good.
-MATT-
Still good.
-TALIESIN-
That's six, 10 points of damage.
-MATT-
10 points of damage, all righty.
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to disengage with-- well, this one's blind, right?
-MATT-
It is blind.
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to run over to the one that just knocked Lionel down.
I've got 20 feet of movement, can I make that?
-MATT-
20. You can get right up to there.
-TALIESIN-
All right. Then for my bonus action, I'll throw a dagger at him.
-MATT-
Actually, you wouldn't be able to get that far, but you can still throw a dagger at him.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, in that case, on my way out, I'm going to hit that dude one more time on the way out, then.
-MATT-
Okay, go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
Like 23 to hit.
-MATT-
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
-TALIESIN-
Four, five, six, seven, eight, 10 points of damage.
-MATT-
10 points of damage. Oh, it's looking hurt.
All righty.
-LAURA-
Is that the one that's--
-LIAM-
Don't ask for "hoo" the bell tolls.
It tolls for thee.
-MATT-
It's your turn.
-TALIESIN-
Your death's going to be "grizzly." [laughter]
-MARISHA-
It's good, it's good.
-ASHLEY-
Wow. (drawn out) Wow.
-TALIESIN-
I only have so many puns, don't be stealing them.
-TRAVIS-
That's hot.
I look down and I see all the wolves and I will cast Bane at 3rd-level.
-MATT-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
On the three remaining doggies.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-MATT-
All right.
-SAM-
Macaroni means family.
-TRAVIS-
They have to roll a charisma saving throw.
-MATT-
They get saving throws, right?
-TRAVIS-
Yep.
-TALIESIN-
I love Bane.
-MATT-
Wisdom, you said?
-TRAVIS-
Charisma.
-MATT-
Charisma, fail.
15?
-TRAVIS-
15 saves.
-MATT-
All right.
And natural one.
So two of them.
-TRAVIS-
Fail.
-MATT-
Two of them fail.
-ASHLEY-
OSD.
-MATT-
This one fails.
-TRAVIS-
OSD.
-MATT-
And this one fails.
-LAURA-
Yea!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All righty.
Oh god.
Why'd I make this so precarious?
-LAURA-
What does Bane do?
-TRAVIS-
It's-- Fuck, I just switched off of it--
-TALIESIN-
It's a d4 negative.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's the opposite of Bless.
-TALIESIN-
They lose a d4 to saves and attacks.
-TRAVIS-
They have to roll a d4 and they lose.
-MATT-
I'm not entirely certain why you cast it at 3rd-level, since at 1st-level it affects three creatures.
-TRAVIS-
How about at 1st-level, then? (laughter)
-MATT-
We'll do that, then.
-TRAVIS-
Ohana means no one gets left behind.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Did he just say "Ohana"?
-LAURA-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
With a bonus action, can I cast Spiritual Weapon? Is that how this shit works?
-LAURA-
No.
-MATT-
Yeah.
One of them has to be a cantrip.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, that's my turn.
-MATT-
All right, but that's a turn.
All righty, Damian, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
At the beginning of your turn, even though it is blinded, it's still terrifying to you, go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.
-ASHLEY-
All right, come on.
Okay, hold on a minute.
Let's see if I can do something about that.
(dramatic music) [laughter] Nine.
-MATT-
Nine.
-MATT-
You are frightened of it.
-SAM-
Shit.
-ASHLEY-
Shit.
-MATT-
It is also blinded, so they cancel each other out if you were to attack it.
-ASHLEY-
(growling)
-TALIESIN-
(unimpressed growling)
-MATT-
It's up to you.
-ASHLEY-
Say again?
-MATT-
Up to you, what do you want to do?
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to attack it.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
First attack does not hit.
Or, well, hold on, let me just double check that.
Does 12 hit?
-MATT-
12 does not hit, no.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I figured.
-MATT-
There you go.
-ASHLEY-
Second hit.
That is 23.
-MATT-
23 does hit, yeah.
-LIAM-
Bada-bing, bada-boom.
-ASHLEY-
All right, and with my bonus action, I'm just going to use my flametongue stiletto just to see how this thing works and I'm going to, it's going to--
-MATT-
And ignite its fire?
-ASHLEY-
Ignite its fire.
-MATT-
Okay. So go ahead and roll damage for the attack.
-LIAM-
Good rolls.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
21 points of damage.
-SAM-
Whoa.
-MATT-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
Woof.
-TRAVIS-
Flametongue stiletto.
-MATT-
As its freaking out, backing up.
(snarling) Its head flapping in the areas where it's cracked open, you carve across it with the secondary strike of the stiletto, the fire catches on its fur and it's now burning them inside as it's screeching into the night.
Looks pretty damn hurt.
That finish your turn, Damian?
-ASHLEY-
That finishes my turn.
-MATT-
All right, that brings us to Farriwen.
-LAURA-
All right.
Is that wolf that's next to Damian, is that within 30 feet of me, can I tell?
-MATT-
It's within 30 feet.
-LAURA-
All right. Then I'm going to turn to it and see everything that Damian's doing to it.
I'm going to use my arm that's lit up with wind glyphs.
I'm going to attack it.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
With the Fist of Unbroken Air.
-MATT-
Go for it, go ahead and roll an attack.
-LAURA-
Oh god, that was aggressive.
Oh good, that was good.
Oh wait, I don't, wait, I don't roll an attack.
It's an automatic thing, you have to make a save against it.
-MATT-
Oh, gotcha.
-LAURA-
It was a good roll too, too bad.
Strength save.
Minus d4.
-MATT-
That is a 10.
-LAURA-
10. Ooh good, it fails! So it takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage.
-ASHLEY-
Damn.
-LAURA-
That would be, eight plus eight is 16, and it's pushed 20 feet back and it's knocked prone.
-MATT-
As you turn around, concentrate your energy, the glyphs glowing on your arm, you pull back and in one very solid hadouken motion, [laughter] you release this burst of radiant aura energy that causes this wind blast to strike the side of it.
It (whimpering) gets lobbed in the air, skids this far and is no longer moving.
-SAM-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
Hadouken.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Hadouken!
-LAURA-
Then for my bonus action.
-MATT-
You still have another attack or is that an action?
-LAURA-
That's an action.
Then for my bonus action, I'm going to leap over Lionel and do some crazy monk shit.
-SAM-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
And I'm going to Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
Unfortunately, if the ability you did wasn't an attack action, you can't do a Flurry of Blows.
-LAURA-
Oh, really?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
I'm going to leap over him and just hit him with one hit.
-SAM-
Some very reasonable monk shit instead of--
-LAURA-
Some very-- Just some--
-MATT-
I'll allow it.
-TRAVIS-
Just your average, run of the mill--
-LAURA-
Sort of sane monk shit.
-MATT-
Exactly.
Leap over to this space there.
-LAURA-
Leap over him.
Why don't I leap over and I'm going to land on his back and punch down.
-MATT-
Go for it, go for it. Roll for the attack.
-LAURA-
Hu-ah! Oh, that's good.
That was 16 plus eight, so I think that hits.
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-LAURA-
All right.
Can I use a ki point to make it-- no, I'm not going to do that, that's a waste.
-MATT-
He's really hurt.
-LAURA-
Six points of damage.
-MATT-
Six points of damage.
Yeah, looking really hurt.
Really, really hurt.
You're riding on its back now as it's trashing around, you're grabbing the fur like-- (struggling sounds)
-LAURA-
Oh, I thought that was going to do it! Oh no.
-MATT-
Buddy, you're up.
-LIAM-
Doggo, I thought I put you in the hole.
(fist slamming) 20 for the first.
-MATT-
That hits.
-LIAM-
Way higher for the second.
-MATT-
That definitely hits then.
[laughter] First one is 12 points.
Nice.
-LIAM-
Second is also 12.
(thudding sound)
-MATT-
The second impact hits and it cracks, like part of its back leg snaps and it rears around and you can see where the leg is dangling in the socket and then where it's torn a bit, another leg-- (bone crunching sound) grows out.
-LIAM-
Wow, you're pretty.
[laughter] He's going to circle around away from me so that he and I are flanking that wolf, there we go.
-MATT-
You got it.
-LIAM-
Hi.
-MATT-
Okay, finishing Buddy's go, that brings us to Tary and Doty.
-SAM-
Oh, don't a lot of us go at the same time?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Oh, but it's my turn?
-MATT-
Well, I mean, and you guys all-- I'm going by the--
-SAM-
Got it, got it, got it.
-MATT-
-- dexterity is the easiest way to do this.
-SAM-
I will bonus action say: Doty, finish that one off.
And he'll climb up and attack.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-SAM-
And roll 15 to hit?
-MATT-
15 just hits.
-SAM-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Nice.
-SAM-
He scores seven points of damage.
-MATT-
Tary rushes up-- or Doty rushes up, "Tary!" (impact) And punches a solid foot and a half into the middle of its torso.
-ASHLEY-
Yes!
-MATT-
Pulls the arm out and then slumps to the ground. Farriwen, you stumble off of its side. It's completely destroyed.
-SAM-
I will also imbue that shot with an Arcane Jolt.
Not to add damage to that attack, though, but to command Doty to heal Lionel by 4d6.
-MATT-
Oh!
-SAM-
And he heals Lionel 10 points.
-MATT-
Nice.
-SAM-
That's my bonus action.
-LAURA-
For the record, I don't-- Fist of the Unbroken Air isn't a spell, it's an actual attack. So technically--
-SAM-
Technically.
-MATT-
Technically.
-LAURA-
I could have done Flurry of Blows, but that's okay.
-MATT-
All right.
-LAURA-
For future reference.
-MATT-
All right, all right.
-TALIESIN-
The book's coming out.
[laughter] It's always dangerous when the book comes out.
-SAM-
Damian, you scared?
-ASHLEY-
Nah.
-SAM-
You're not scared?
-ASHLEY-
I hit that thing.
I hit that thing and then it like disappeared in like a flurry.
-MATT-
There is the attack action, and then there is, as an action, you spend two ki points and choose a creature and it has an effect on it.
The bonus action, being able to attack--
-LAURA-
It just says taking on--
-MATT-
With Flurry of Blows, let me double check.
-LAURA-
It just says after the attack, if you take an attack action.
-LIAM-
This a real D&amp;D table, folks.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
I just want to know for future if I can do it.
-MATT-
I understand. The attack action is when you just do your two attacks.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So if you do the pop, pop, as other monks would say.
[laughter] Then you get to spend a ki point to do Flurry of Blows.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
That ability is an action, but it's not considered the attack action, so you can't follow it up.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
But good looking out.
-SAM-
For my action, I'll fly over to The Owlbear and infuse his-- what are you wearing?
-TALIESIN-
It's an owlbear cowl.
It's a cowl.
-SAM-
I'm going to infuse his cowl with cowl of the bat, making him sort of a bat man.
[cheering] In dim light or darkness, you can fly like a bat.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
And I believe it's getting dim, isn't it?
-MATT-
It's post-sunset, yeah.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-SAM-
♪ (Batman theme) ♪
-TALIESIN-
So you're saying I can now fly like an owlbear? [laughter]
-SAM-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Amazing.
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes your turn, Taryon?
-SAM-
Yes.
-MATT-
Hazel, you're up.
-LIAM-
♪ Into the hoo-ture ♪
-MARISHA-
Okay, I can do this bigger, I think, yeah.
-SAM-
Oh good.
-MARISHA-
As the Darrington Brigade quickly makes work of the giant wolfie beasts, Boty snaps the hind legs of one of the wolves and you hear a thunderous clap reverberate through the woods and I cast Thunderclap on that guy.
-SAM-
Well.
-MATT-
All right, what's the range on Thunderclap?
-SAM-
100 feet.
100 feet.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
You're right.
-SAM-
No, no, you've done it, it's done.
-TRAVIS-
Bring it, bring it.
-SAM-
It's happening.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you narrated the damn thing.
(laughs)
-SAM-
Can't undo it.
Yep.
-MARISHA-
New character.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Five feet, five feet.
-MATT-
Five-foot range?
-TRAVIS-
Five-foot?
-LIAM-
Creatures within five feet of you.
-MARISHA-
Oh wait, wait, wait.
"You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away."
-LAURA-
It's heard.
-MARISHA-
Heard. Hmm, yeah. 100 feet.
-MATT-
"Each creature other than you."
-SAM-
Every creature.
-MARISHA-
I gotcha.
-SAM-
Every creature.
-MARISHA-
Oh shit.
[laughter] You guys are fine.
-SAM-
Yeah.
You cranked it up to 11.
-MATT-
All right. What level did you cast it at?
-MARISHA-
Just a cantrip.
-LIAM-
Everybody hears it, creatures within five feet are the ones that need to make the con save.
-LAURA-
Yeah, only things within five feet of you.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Within range.
-MARISHA-
Each creature within range.
-MATT-
Yes, which means--
-MARISHA-
Oh.
-MATT-
Yeah, so you got to move up to him if you want to.
-MARISHA-
But then why does it say-- oh, but it can just be heard.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Wow, what a weird specification.
Why would you put 100 feet in your spell thing if just it can be heard 100 feet away.
-TRAVIS-
Because it's thunder.
-LIAM-
This is just how it went in rehearsal, guys.
[laughter] We even work in the errors to give that flavor of authenticity.
-SAM-
Yeah, yeah, it's true.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, so wait, wait, wait, wait.
-SAM-
The writers are real good.
-MARISHA-
Fuck me, as I give my description, I climb down the mountain as I'm and with a thunderous roar--
-MATT-
Finishing the description.
-MARISHA-
I climb over and the-- (thunder) Then you hear a thunderous clap.
-TRAVIS-
(farting noise) (laughter)
-MATT-
That is a failure.
So you can roll your 2d6.
-MARISHA-
Woo, six damage.
-MATT-
Six damage.
[laughter] (explosion) The sound echoes out, you see two clusters of birds from the nearby trees.
(fluttering)
-MARISHA-
(cymbal crash)
-MATT-
And you're pretty sure you've alerted everything within a certain radius of the forest.
-SAM-
About 100 feet?
-MATT-
About 100 feet.
-MARISHA-
And the sight was glorious.
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes your turn, Hazel.
Top of the round, it is now the wolf's turn.
In a bad position. However, you got its attention, Hazel, with that clap, so it's going to go ahead and turn and try and bite you.
That is a 17 to hit.
-MARISHA-
Hits.
-MATT-
All righty, you suffer 11 points of piercing damage and make a strength saving throw, please.
-MARISHA-
Ew.
Mm-hmm. 22.
-MATT-
22, you're fine.
You manage to wrench yourself free from its jaws.
That ends its turn.
-MARISHA-
I just throw my tuba at him.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Good call.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
Owlbear Batman.
-TALIESIN-
I heal four points.
-MATT-
You heal four points.
-TALIESIN-
I turn to look at the last of these creatures that is left, I yell.
(yelling) And I leap off towards it, full speed.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Are you running or flying?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I'm going to glide until I land on them.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Just like an Owlbear.
[laughter] All right.
-TALIESIN-
It's engaged, right?
-MATT-
Yes, it is.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, so that's advantage.
-LAURA-
Nice.
-TRAVIS-
It's so fucking hilarious.
-TALIESIN-
That's a 10 to hit.
-MATT-
No, that's going to miss, sorry.
-TALIESIN-
It's all right, I'm going to go again.
That's a 24 to hit.
-SAM-
Whoa.
-MATT-
Okay, so that'll hit, that'll hit.

It get there.

-ASHLEY-

-LAURA-
Owlbear!
-ASHLEY-
Owlbear.
-TALIESIN-
I want to re-roll that, I can do that.
Yeah, I got things.
That didn't matter, never mind.
Nine, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 points of damage.
-MATT-
17 points of damage, got it.
-TALIESIN-
It's still standing, I'm going to go again.
-MATT-
It's still standing.
Bonus action. Go ham.
-TALIESIN-
(growling) [laughter]
21 to hit?
-MATT-
That hits.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-TALIESIN-
That's 12 points of damage.
-MATT-
12 points of damage as you eviscerate the side of it, it's pulling back angrily, spitting its own blood at you.
It's barely standing, but it's still standing.
-TALIESIN-
Look at me, look at me. (growling) [laughter]
-MATT-
Macaroni, it's your turn.
-TALIESIN-
Trying to make eye contact.
-TRAVIS-
I will cast Sacred Flame.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TRAVIS-
Finally.
-MATT-
That's a 13?
-TRAVIS-
No, 15.
-MATT-
Yeah, so go ahead and roll damage on that.
-TRAVIS-
Sucka! That is 13 points of radiant damage.
-MATT-
How do you want to do this? [cheering]
-TRAVIS-
I look down and say: Nobody hurts my friend, Buddy.
(explosion) [laughter]
-MATT-
Perfect.
As you finish your squeal of divine war caster might-- [laughter] You see it rear back, look you up in the face with its head tilted-- (confused whimper) Then-- Just liquefies into the ground as the flame burns and causes it to congeal into, basically returning to the ash around this burned and charred landscape.
-TRAVIS-
Ew.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
And with incredible tenacity, Taryon deals the final blow on the last beast.
(glockenspiel glissando)
-SAM-
I like you.
I like you a lot, Hazel.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Thank you, thank you, captain.
-SAM-
Excellent work, Brigade.
-LAURA-
Did anyone notice that those wolves had extra eyes and tentacles coming out of their mouths?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, those weren't like full blown dire wolves.
They were something else.
That's what I think.
-SAM-
I haven't seen anything like it around these woods.
Maybe it's the result of some sort of evil magic that has to do with this crater?
-MARISHA-
Our leader pontificated.
-SAM-
Yes, while we think on this, we should follow any other tracks that we have seen to see the source of this nightmarish magic.
-TALIESIN-
What kind of tracks are they? I want to check the tracks.
What do they look like?
-MATT-
Make an investigation check.
-TALIESIN-
It's not a nature check or anything like that, it's an investigation check. That's fine, that's fine.
I can do that, we're fine.
-LAURA-
I like that you've got, like, permanent eye holes where your owl mask-- [laughter] - was on your head.
-TALIESIN-
One for the owl's and one for the bear's.
[laughter] 13.
-MATT-
13? Okay.
-SAM-
Is this an ability check?
-MATT-
Yeah, this is an ability check of his.
-SAM-
I will wave my hair around and give him an extra four.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
A d4?
-SAM-
Just a four, four more.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
17.
-MATT-
So looking at the groove that grinds itself up and out of the crater and leading in a south direction, looking at it, you find that there are some other signs of footprints.
Now roll a nature check.
-TALIESIN-
24.
-SAM-
(like The Owlbear) Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
It's hard to tell precisely what these feet are, but they appear to be webbed.
[laughter]
-AUDIENCE-
(dawning realization) Oh!
-TRAVIS-
Shut the fuck up.
-SAM-
Oh no.
[laughter] Oh no.
Lionel, do you sense anything?
-MATT-
"I mean, I sense a lot of things right now, boss.
Like, it's a lot in my colon.
A lot in, like, the back of my neck, left shoulder."
-SAM-
Just let that wash right off your back, though.
-MATT-
"Okay, okay."
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-SAM-
But nothing, nothing nothing specifically duck-related hitting you?
-MATT-
"Let me go ask them. I can't: they're all dead."
-LAURA-
Aw!
-MATT-
"I just have a really uneasy feeling."
-SAM-
Sorry.
-TALIESIN-
Are there any other birds or otherwise around?
-MATT-
"There was, until the thunderclap."
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Great.
-SAM-
Which direction do these tracks lead?
-MATT-
You're the one who spotted them.
-SAM-
Bat-owl-bear-man.
-TALIESIN-
That way.
-SAM-
That way?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that way, right there.
-SAM-
I say we follow them.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, we should go southeast.
-TALIESIN-
Was that southeast?
-LAURA-
Aren't we going to sit and have a snack and maybe take a rest?
-SAM-
Do you need that?
-LAURA-
Well, only if everyone else does.
-TRAVIS-
Is anybody, like, you know, hurt and stuff? Because I'm sitting pretty up here.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
I'm a little hurt.
-TRAVIS-
You're a little hurt? Who else, anybody?
-TALIESIN-
I'm a little hurt.
-TRAVIS-
How the fuck do healing spells work? [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Well.
-LAURA-
By a little, I mean 33 points down.
-TALIESIN-
Woof.
-ASHLEY-
You're--
-TALIESIN-
There's some that take 10 minutes, some that require touch, and some that have distance with their touch, they heal a bit more if they take 10 minutes.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, give me a fucking second, okay? [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Doty, take this down.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, do you want to take a second? I mean, what do you want?
-MARISHA-
I am quite the skilled campfire builder, just throwing it out there and I've got a great audio book if we want to take a minute.
-SAM-
The Darrington Brigade does not rest when we are on a mission.
We continue forward and forge ahead because we, the proud, the few? [laughter] The Brigadines.
[laughter] Have a mission that must be accomplished so that we can get ♪ paid ♪.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Can you say that last line one more time?
-SAM-
So that we can get ♪ paid ♪.
-MARISHA-
Thank you, got it, got it.
-SAM-
He's got it already.
-TALIESIN-
Would Heroism have topped me off at this point? Or does that cancel--
-SAM-
It lasts for one minute, so--
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah, so I'm totally healed, never mind.
-TRAVIS-
Can I jump down and I'll-- oof, ah!-- and run over to Farriwen and use Cure Wounds.
Yes?
-MATT-
Yeah, what level?
-TRAVIS-
(stammering) 3rd-level!
-MATT-
All right, so 3d8 plus your wisdom modifier.
-LIAM-
So no rest, we're doing a quickie heal?
-SAM-
We're just moving.
-LAURA-
Because Taryon says so because we're all making a lot of money off of this. Oh wait, no, we're not.
[laughter]
-SAM-
You can actually write down your share of the 10,000 gold as a in-kind donation and get that amount taken off of your taxes at the end of the year.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh, so that 10,000 in gold goes not to us.
-SAM-
To the people.
To the people of Wildemount.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm a people of Wildemount.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
20 points of healing, 20.
-LAURA-
Thank you, Macaroni.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, you're welcome.
She's really nice.
She's so flowy.
-SAM-
If you need to rest, we can.
-LAURA-
Well, now Macaroni just used his spell so I feel guilty about it.
-SAM-
I feel bad.
Are you okay?
-LAURA-
I'm fine.
-SAM-
All right.
-LIAM-
Buddy rips a massive, rank fart.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to stay down here for a second.
[laughter] That shit just climbs.
[laughter] Heat rises!
-SAM-
Macaroni, thank you for doing a solid to your teammate.
I will infuse your boots with teleportation.
[laughter] I've got lots of powers! [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Hey, if I'm going to stay down here with you guys, can you do something to my thing?
-SAM-
What does that mean?
-TRAVIS-
It's called a Yklwa.
-SAM-
What is that?
-TRAVIS-
It's a fucking, like a, it's a pointy.
-LIAM-
Ow!
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit, sorry, Buddy.
-LIAM-
That's okay.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
Yklwa, Yklwa, it's got some crazy ass letters in it.
-LIAM-
Yklwa.
-TRAVIS-
Yklwa.
-SAM-
Is it a weapon?
-LIAM-
It's in the book, Yklwa.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, it's a weapon.
-SAM-
And it stabs?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-SAM-
I can't do shit to that, but I can give you boots of teleportation, so on a bonus action, you can teleport 15 feet.
-TRAVIS-
Hah! Done.
-TALIESIN-
That's going to go well.
-TRAVIS-
Just once or like all the time?
-SAM-
Just once.
-TRAVIS-
Oh fuck.
[laughter]
-SAM-
While I'm giving out stuff, you've got your horn.
-MARISHA-
Yes!
-SAM-
I'm going to infuse that with my last infusion of the day.
It is now also a Pipe of the Sewers.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
That's a rough review, man.
-SAM-
You can summon a swarm of rats.
[laughter] And if you roll high enough, they'll listen to you.
[laughter] If not, just a swarm of rats.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
So she can Louie Armstrong some rats out of her horn? [laughter]
-MATT-
The sound it makes, however, is terrifying.
-MARISHA-
Do they just all sound like Orson Welles?
-TALIESIN-
Bend the-- okay no, I'm sorry.
-TRAVIS-
One unholy brown note.
[laughter]
-MATT-
So there are tracks.
-SAM-
Oh yeah, we should--
-TALIESIN-
We're going that way, we're already moving.
-MATT-
All right, you're following the tracks.
Continuing on into the early evening, about another hour or so before you reach the base curvature of the Cyrios Mountains.
The tracks glide into an opening to a subterranean chamber.
Do you enter the chamber?
-LAURA-
We probably should.
-MATT-
All right, do you have a marching order?
-SAM-
Go ahead, Farriwen.
-LAURA-
All right.
-LIAM-
I'll go near the front.
-MATT-
All right, so Buddy's going to the front.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And Farriwen, then who's with Farriwen?
-ASHLEY-
I'll jump in with Farriwen.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, we can--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
You go-- I'll get behind Owlbear.
-LAURA-
Thank you, Damian.
-ASHLEY-
Oh you're welcome, Farriwen.
-MATT-
Then who's after them? Hazel? Lionel will come in, too.
-SAM-
Yep, I'll be behind Hazel.
Doty will be behind me.
-MARISHA-
As an observer, I'm bringing up the rear.
-MATT-
All righty.
-MARISHA-
I like to have a full scope of what I'm reporting on.
-MATT-
Descending into this--
-TALIESIN-
Just an oompah band.
[laughter]
-MATT-
--eight to 10-foot wide cavern.
-SAM-
Extra!
-MATT-
It's not a super deep descent. It's a relatively shallow decline, but as you walk in, the cave itself, it smells of old hard water and fungus.
The winding, damp, rocky path eventually opens up into a large chamber with a pool of water that sits across the way.
You can see peeking from the surface of the water, a large shimmering stone.
Very similar in appearance and glow as to the shards that you had found within the crater itself.
-LIAM-
Pretty.
-TRAVIS-
Now.
-SAM-
What do you guys see up there?
-LIAM-
A rock.
-TRAVIS-
Buddy found a rock.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, it looks like it's the same shiny stuff that was in the crater. I think this is the, you know, the main part of it.
-SAM-
Oh like, the meteor itself?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
The thing, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, the meteor itself.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Do you want Buddy to lift it?
-SAM-
Please, yes, especially if there's something behind it, yes.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to back up.
-LIAM-
He just starts, he's dumb as bricks--
-MATT-
Are you guys backing up like towards the entrance of this cavern?
-TALIESIN-
No, I'm just going to like go against the wall and see what happens.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Buddy is dumb as bricks; he's already marching out towards this rock.
-MATT-
Okay, are you guys following Buddy or you all staying in the hallway?
-TRAVIS-
I'm following Buddy.
-SAM-
Staying in the hallway.
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to stealth and try to hide in the corner.
-TRAVIS-
Actually, I'll skitter up on the chariot, woo hoo!
-MATT-
Okay.
[laughter] Farriwen?
-LAURA-
Sure, why not, I'll follow.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'm going to follow.
-MATT-
All righty, Lionel will follow.
-TRAVIS-
Are you sure you want to follow?
-MATT-
The three of you are staying behind.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'm going to hide.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
I'll follow to the side in case there's another one of those farts.
-MATT-
Okay.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Pretty likely.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
It's kind of like a second snack.
-LIAM-
You're welcome.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
I'm sorry.
-MATT-
As you approach, bounding towards it, you can see that the glittering stone itself, size wise, it probably sits at about, I'd say, anywhere from six to 10 feet across, like it's a large stone and you're only seeing the top of it, peeking out the top of the water surface.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As you approach, the water that it sits in begins to ripple around the stone.
-LIAM-
The lights sparkle and dabble across his giant goggles and he is going to reach for it and try to lift it.
Is what he's going to do, because he's real smart.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
What are you doing, what are you doing?
-MATT-
Let me get a map for this cavern so you can--
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
[cheering]
-SAM-
Guys, Austin has been amazing, you guys have such great hospitality.
-ASHLEY-
Yay! [cheering]
-LAURA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-SAM-
And you know what else is amazing, the fourth floor merchandise, it's stuff that you can only get here at this show at-- oh shit.
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy.
-TRAVIS-
What the--
-ASHLEY-
Whoa!
-LAURA-
Oh wow, Matt!
-TALIESIN-
Oh no.
-SAM-
Wow, wow.
-LAURA-
That's huge!
-TALIESIN-
Wow.
-MATT-
So the three of you would be up here by the entrance.
-LIAM-
Wow.
-SAM-
Uh-huh.
-MATT-
Hazel, Taryon.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, we're in deep shit.
-MATT-
And Doty.
[laughter]
Buddy is rushing towards the edge here.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to--
-MATT-
The stone is right here in the middle.
-LAURA-
It's in the water?
-MATT-
It's in the water, yup.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to hide if I can, behind one of those, like I'm going to try and sneak in and hide behind one of those--
-MATT-
Over here?
-TALIESIN-
You've got those little pikes over there, yeah.
-MATT-
Over here, you mean?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
Farriwen, where you going?
-LAURA-
I'm going to cross over and hide behind a pillar on the other side, yeah, right there.
-MATT-
Over here? All right, go ahead and roll stealth check.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
Go for it and Damian, where you going?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I'm going to go stand next to Farriwen.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
20 for stealth.
-MATT-
You got it. Owlbear?
-TALIESIN-
Natural one.
[laughter] [cheering]
-MATT-
As you carefully lean against the stalagmite-- (cracking sound) (laughter)
It cracks and crumbles to the ground loudly.
-TALIESIN-
I'm just going to pretend to be the stalagmite for a moment.
-MATT-
Okay.
[laughter] The impact of the broken rock causes the chamber to quake a bit.
-LAURA-
Oh shite.
-MATT-
As you begin to like wade into the water a bit, Buddy.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-MATT-
The stone begins to move upward from the pond.
-LIAM-
That's easy.
-TRAVIS-
Don't touch, don't touch.
-MATT-
Peeking--
-ASHLEY-
Buddy!
-MATT-
Peeking from the surface, you see the sparkling stone and it begins to reveal beneath it and engulfing it, a massive swollen duck-like creature [laughter] of ill green feathers and flesh, its burning eyes staring towards you as four terrible whipping tentacle limbs protrude from its body.
The stone is embedded within its back with a dark vein specifically writhing around where it's peering from its body.
-LAURA-
Let me see it, I got to see it.
-SAM-
Oh god, oh god.
It's a ducktopus.
[laughter] Duck'atoa?
Duckt'atoa.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Yeah!
-LAURA-
It's huge!
-MARISHA-
It's a ducktopus!
-SAM-
Wow!
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
I love him! [laughter] He's so cute.
-LIAM-
Save the duck.
-MATT-
I need you guys-- [laughter] [cheering]
-LAURA-
Oh my god!
-TRAVIS-
Oh my god.
-ASHLEY-
Matt.
-MATT-
Yes.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-LIAM-
We must protect him at all costs.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
(growling)
-LAURA-
(laughter) [cheering]
Oh my gosh.
-MATT-
I need you all to roll initiative against Quackthulhu.
-ASHLEY-
No! [cheering]
-MARISHA-
Wow.
-MATT-
All righty, 25 to 20?
-TALIESIN-
20.
-ASHLEY-
20.
-LIAM-
20.
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Damn! All righty, we have Owlbear.
Damian, what's your dexterity?
-ASHLEY-
My dexterity is, wait, 19.
(dramatic music) (inaudible murmuring)
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
So, 20 to 15?
-LAURA-
Oh 13.
-MATT-
All right.
(dramatic music) All righty, 15 to 10?
-TRAVIS-
12.
-MARISHA-
Oh sorry, 14, 14.
-TRAVIS-
Jesus.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All righty.
Then we have up the end there, Macaroni.
Never gets old.
Macaroni does. That name-- anyway.
At the top actually, with a natural 20 on initiative is Lionel.
-TRAVIS-
Tary--
-SAM-
Is Lionel?
-MATT-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
Tary, what'd you roll?
-SAM-
Oh six, sorry.
-MATT-
Yeah, I assumed you were in there.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Tary and Doty.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-MATT-
All righty.
Lionel, who now steps down and watches this creature emerge and goes, "Oh no, what have they done to you?" [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh no!
-MATT-
Quackthulhu spins around and its piercing red gaze looks to him and you see the spirit duck totem within him suddenly shunt out of his body.
(gasping) The same red glow in the duck's eyes now fill Lionel's.
-LAURA-
No!
-ASHLEY-
No!
-ALL-
No!
-ASHLEY-
Matthew!
-LAURA-
Why?
-MATT-
Who is going to take two attacks on Buddy.
-LAURA-
No! [laughter]
-MATT-
Natural 20.
-LAURA-
(gasps) [cheering]
-MATT-
And an 18.
-LIAM-
Okay.
[laughter]
-MATT-
They both hit?
-ASHLEY-
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What were they?
-LIAM-
Wait.
-SAM-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
Natural 20.
-ASHLEY-
What was the second one?
-LIAM-
18.
-MATT-
And a 18.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I'm going to use one of my defensive runes.
He's within 60 feet of me?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, you're going to get a plus four to your AC.
-LIAM-
That bops the second one out.
-MATT-
Second hit does not hit! [cheering]
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
17 points of slashing damage from the first strike as Lionel goes into a rage, immediately possessed by Quackthulhu, slices down heavily into the back--
-LAURA-
(laughs) Quackthulhu?
-MATT-
--of Buddy's ogre-ish body and screams out.
-LIAM-
Ow!
-MATT-
Goes in for a second strike and as Damian sees this, immediately triggers the rune and (explosion) a shield of arcane energy deflects the secondary blow. That is the end of Lionel's turn. It is now Damian's go. What are you doing?
-ASHLEY-
Oh, you just said my name, I'm sorry.
-MATT-
That is you, that is indeed you.
-ASHLEY-
Sorry, I was like, I just went.
Okay, okay.
-LAURA-
I thought Damian was after Buddy, no?
-MATT-
I'm going by whoever has the highest dexterity.
-LIAM-
They were all the same initiative order, higher dex goes first.
-LAURA-
Right, right, right, right.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, so I am going to see this very large duck.
[laughter] So I'm going to make myself giant as well.
So Giant Might on myself.
-MATT-
All righty.
I do not have a giant Damian figure, so we'll just consider this to be your base.
-ASHLEY-
All good.
-MATT-
So you occupy that much space.
-ASHLEY-
And then, oh boy.
If I get up around there.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Like up on the, yeah.
Am I in, it's like I'm like (Elvis sound)
-MATT-
Yeah, I'll allow that.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
I'm going to take some attacks.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
Oh okay, okay.
26.
-MATT-
That hits.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Is your blade still flaming from earlier?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I never took it out.
-MATT-
Never took it off, so yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay, so that's going to be this.
(dramatic music) 17 for the first hit.
-MATT-
Nice, second strike.
-ASHLEY-
Second strike.
Probably doesn't hit, 17?
-MATT-
17 again, or is that to hit?
-ASHLEY-
That was to hit.
-MATT-
To hit, that misses.
-MATT-
So the first time you swing or bring the stiletto forward and pierce the inside of its body, you pull back and a dark green black liquid oozes from it and it (growl, deep quacking sound) in your direction.
-ASHLEY-
Oh wait.
I didn't roll an extra d8 for the Giant Might.
-MATT-
Right, so go ahead and roll another d8 for the first--
-ASHLEY-
One.
-MATT-
All right.
18.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I got him!
-MATT-
The second strike, you go to swing and one of the tentacles whips in front of you and ends up deflecting the attack and you're pissed off by it.
(laughter) Take that, microphone.
-ASHLEY-
(growling)
-LIAM-
You just hit that like Marisha Ray striking an Irishman.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
I hit you one time when you were leaning over my space, motherfucker! [cheering]
-LIAM-
You've all watched the show. How many times has she come close to smacking me in the face? [cheering]
-LAURA-
Oh 10, I saw 10 there.
-SAM-
Nine.
-ASHLEY-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Bonus action to do that.
-MARISHA-
I am watching all of you all right now.
You're all in my line of sight.
-LIAM-
Yeah, careful, because she'll hit you.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Why do you think I'm wearing pads today?
-MATT-
Hey, hey, Owl-bat-bear, it's your turn.
-LIAM-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Well.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
(tambourine jingling)
-TALIESIN-
First, of course, I'm going to rage.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Tonight, we feast on evil most fowl! (growling) [laughter] I appreciate none of you taking that, thank you.
I'm going to strafe within 20 feet of it, but not get too close. Then I'm going to peel off and then get some cover afterward, but once I'm within 20 feet, I'm going to throw two daggers.
-MATT-
You're within 20 feet right there.
-TALIESIN-
All right, I'm throwing two daggers.
-MATT-
All righty, go for it.
-TALIESIN-
Do I have advantage because it's in-combat?
-MATT-
Well, it's not advantage in-combat, you can do sneak attack because they're next to an ally.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, they're next to him, so I can do sneak attack.
-MATT-
Correct, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's 26 to hit.
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-TALIESIN-
All right, that's a--
-MATT-
It's not an advantage roll, but he is able to do sneak attack.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I didn't get advantage on that.
-MATT-
No, you did not.
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I rolled advantage so I'll take my, I'll just take my disadvantage.
-MATT-
Go ahead and roll a new attack, how about that?
-TALIESIN-
Oh, I can do that too, all right.
20 to hit?
-MATT-
That hits. There you go.
So you do sneak because currently both Buddy and Damian are harrying the creature.
-MATT-
No! [laughter]
-SAM-
Who are you, man?
-LIAM-
It's the Court of the Owl.
[cheering]
-TALIESIN-
19 points of damage?
-MATT-
Nice!
-TALIESIN-
And the second--
-LAURA-
(hooting) [hooting]
-TALIESIN-
(hooting) Yep.
22 to hit.
-MATT-
22 hits, roll damage for the second attack.
-TALIESIN-
Eight points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice.
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to try and use the rest of my movement, and I have a movement of 40, so I'm going to use the rest of my movement to try and get some cover from this thing, get as far away from it as possible.
-MATT-
Five, 10, 15, 20, that's as far as you can get.
-TALIESIN-
That'll do it.
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes your go.
Buddy, you're up.
-LIAM-
Okay, he's staring in the face of this massive duck creature, but he's also seeing for the first time and he doesn't know how old he is, he doesn't know shit so he just goes: Oh...
Beautiful! And he accidentally presses his hands up and hits a button on the side of the chariot and one of the tesla coils goes, (powering up buzzing) and fires lightning straight out at the duck creature.
-MATT-
All righty.
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
[cheering]
-SAM-
That feature is untested, I wouldn't-- okay, well, it's happening.
-MATT-
That is a 10 for its saving throw.
What is the DC on that?
-LIAM-
It is 15 so it fails.
-MATT-
Fails, go ahead and roll damage.
-LIAM-
And-- Shit, I got distracted by how funny our show is.
-MATT-
Actually, you know what, I'm going to use a legendary resistance.
-SAM-
Legendary resistance.
-ALL-
Aw!
-LIAM-
It's a legendary duck.
-MATT-
Yep.
So it does succeed.
-LIAM-
So 10d6.
-SAM-
Oh!
-LIAM-
Nine. 14.
19. 27.
And finally-- 39.
-MATT-
39, all right, that brings us to 19, I think.
-SAM-
Sounds right, sounds right.
-MATT-
Yeah, for the half, all righty.
So as the energy (explosion) courses through, you see the duck, the giant creature try and go beneath the water to avoid the flash and it coasts across the outside of its body and it takes the impact, but not the full brunt of it.
-LIAM-
Can Buddy vaguely tell how deep the water is that he's stepping into, it looks like?
-MATT-
Where he's in right now, it's about three feet.
-LIAM-
Three feet? He's going to like curve around the side of the duck a little bit and get into the water.
-MATT-
Okay, around this way, you mean?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
-MATT-
Okay, he gets to about four feetish from there, so he's up to his upper thigh.
-LIAM-
That works for me, great.
-MATT-
Okay.
So that finishes Buddy's go. It's now its turn.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-SAM-
Get ready.
-MATT-
It's going to go ahead and make its multiattack.
It's going to make a strike on, let's see, at that range there, yeah, it's going to stay put.
It's going to go ahead and make two attacks.
It's going to make an attack on Buddy, an attack on you, Macaroni.
(laughter) And two attacks on you, Damian.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
He has four attacks.
-MATT-
So the duck tentacle attack against you, Damian.
-SAM-
The duck tentacle?
-MATT-
It's going to be 18 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
Aw, yeah it hits.
-MATT-
It hits you.
-ASHLEY-
I'm on the other side. I'm in front of his face.
-MATT-
You take 11 points of bludgeoning damage and make a strength saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
'Kay.
That a hill rune is probably gone by now.
Let me just double check.
Yep, only lasts a minute so I'm sure that's gone, okay.
Wisdom saving throw?
-MATT-
A strength saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
Strength saving throw is what I meant to say.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Oh, I get advantage on it because of the giant might.
Okay, that's a little better.
-LIAM-
Slightly, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
17?
-MATT-
17, yeah.
It tries to grab and grapple you with its tentacle, but it's unable to do so. You push your way out of its grasp.
-ASHLEY-
Get the fuck outta here! [laughter]
-MATT-
Second attack on you, that's going to be another 19 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That's going to be another 11 points of bludgeoning damage.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
(dramatic music)
-MATT-
So make another strength saving throw.
-ASHLEY-
Yep.
-MATT-
It's trying to wrap itself around you there.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, even better.
23.
-MATT-
Damn it.
[laughter] All right, you know what? It's going to turn over and go for the tinier option there.
It's going to go ahead and make one strike against you, Macaroni.
-TRAVIS-
No, I'm here for decoration!
-MATT-
It's a 30 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Shit! [laughter]
-MARISHA-
30.
-MATT-
Oh, double eights! That's going to be 24 points of bludgeoning damage.
-TRAVIS-
Fuck you.
-MATT-
I need you to make a strength saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no!
-LAURA-
Oh god.
-TRAVIS-
20, bitch.
[cheering]
-MATT-
All right, it's going to attack you again, Macaroni.
-TRAVIS-
(yelling)
-MATT-
It ignores you and goes: No, fuck the little guy.
That is a 16 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Just misses.
-MATT-
You duck under and it slams the top of the platform and it knocks you a little bit off kilter, but the water displacement actually helps anchor you in place and you hold fast and fine.
-LIAM-
Sentinel, bitch.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Oh, yeah.
-LIAM-
Buddy's eyes go, (explosion) and he goes apoplectic and slams the shit out of the duck. Hopefully.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
14, not that good.
-MATT-
No, 14 does not hit, unfortunately.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
Splash into the water next to it.
-TRAVIS-
Thanks, pal.
-MATT-
All right, that's going to finish its turn.
Hazel, you're up.
-MARISHA-
Oh, goodness gracy-ious.
-SAM-
Extra, extra.
-MARISHA-
Read all about it.
All right. Fuck me.
(laughter) I adjust my audiophone into my mouth and I say: As the beaked abomination rises from the abyss, the malice mallard takes hold of Lionel.
Fatigued from the fight, the duck begins to slow like it does on a turkey dinner.
Whatever, you don't know what happens in Wildemount.
[laughter] And I cast Slow on both Duckthulhu and Lionel.
-SAM-
Oh, because he's fast.
-MATT-
That's a fail for the duck.
It's going to use its secondary legendary resistance to resist it.
-TALIESIN-
Running them out.
-MATT-
Lionel definitely does not succeed.
-LAURA-
With legendary resistances, does it work like, does it get three per round or is it three total?
-MATT-
It's three total.
-LAURA-
Okay, cool.
-MARISHA-
And he's used two.
-MATT-
So that's your action. You do manage to slow Lionel.
-MARISHA-
I manage to slow Lionel, and I give a bard-iac inspiray-tion to Taryon Darry-ington.
-SAM-
Oh!
-MATT-
Inspired by all the additional syllables, you feel yourself rejuvenated.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Never heard my name pronounced like that. I like it.
It sounds exotic.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All righty, Hazel, do you want to move or stay put?
-MARISHA-
(old time radio announcer grumbling) I'm going to move up just a little bit.
-MATT-
Move up just a little bit.
All right, so you descend the steps slightly about there.
That's 15 feet.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that's good.
-MATT-
Okay.
All righty, finishing with Hazel's turn, Farriwen, you're up.
-LAURA-
Okay.
I'm going to run out from behind where I'm hiding and I'm going to try to flank him on the other side with Buddy.
-MATT-
All right, so five, 10, 15, 20, you splash into the water there and you can't feel your feet touch the ground.
-LAURA-
Oh shit.
-MATT-
So you (splashing) into it, which means you have disadvantage in the water.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
But you have flanking advantage, so it's just a standard attack.
So now you're doing cool monk shit in the water.
[cheering]
-LAURA-
It's a good thing I'm a genasi.
No, I can't walk on water, but I can hold my breath forever.
-LAURA-
All right, well, that doesn't really make a difference right now, but it's pretty cool.
(laughter) I'm going to spin my glaive around and try to slash him under his tentacle.
-MATT-
Go for it, roll for attack.
-LAURA-
All right. Hyah! Ooh! 19 plus 10.
-MATT-
19 plus 10, that definitely hits.
-LAURA-
All right. I'm going to use a ki point to Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
Okay, well, roll your damage first.
-LAURA-
(cackles)
-TRAVIS-
That'll be a lot of bird shit in the audience.
-LAURA-
Nine points of damage with the dual glaive.
-MATT-
Nine points of damage.
-AUDIENCE-
Nein!
-MATT-
That's a 17 save.
-LAURA-
That saves, all right.
I'm going to--
-MATT-
Second attack.
-LAURA-
That's all right, I'm going to spin it and slash him the other way, I'm going to try to slice off his tentacle completely.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-LAURA-
It's totally going to work.
19 again plus 10.
-MATT-
That hits, roll damage a second time.
-LAURA-
That's eight points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice.
-LAURA-
And I'm going to try it again.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Stunning Strike.
-MATT-
16.
-LAURA-
That's what he needed, 16, yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, so he succeeds.
-LAURA-
All right.
And I'm going to Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
No.
-MATT-
If you want to.
-LAURA-
Yes, no.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-SAM-
No?
-LAURA-
No, I'm going to Patient Defense.
-MATT-
Okay, so you take the dodge action as a bonus action.
You're now in the water.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
You know, maybe I should use the remainder of my movement to back up out of the water.
Because I have 50 feet of movement, can I do that?
-MATT-
You can, yeah.
-LAURA-
So I can get solid ground.
-MATT-
Going to move up, but it will get an attack opportunity on you as you move out of its range.
-LAURA-
Never mind--
-MATT-
But it does have disadvantage on the attack because you took Patient Defense.
Up to you.
-LAURA-
I'm going to stay in the water, I'm going to stay in the water.
-MATT-
Swim in the deep. Finishing up Farriwen's turn.
Macaroni, you're up.
Tary, you're on deck.
-TRAVIS-
It's getting intense up in here and I will cinch up the little straps on my backpack and I will reach over and pull a lever on the chariot and I will trigger the ejector seat and I will splay out my da Vinci wings and [laughter] hang glide back towards the entrance.
-MATT-
This way?
-TRAVIS-
40 feet.
-SAM-
You're fleeing? You're running away?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, fuck this!
-SAM-
Do you want to cast something first? Like cast a spell or anything?
-TRAVIS-
I will cast--
-MATT-
It gets an attack of opportunity on you as you leave its combat range.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, but I'm flying.
-MATT-
You are flying, and it rolls a 25 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit! [laughter]
-LIAM-
Sail!
-MATT-
You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage.
-TRAVIS-
(shouts)
-MATT-
And make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-TRAVIS-
20.
[cheering]
-MATT-
The tentacle slaps you hard and one of the wings buckles for a moment, but you catch yourself back up--
-LAURA-
Nice.
-MATT-
You continue your glide down, it does not snatch you out of the air, unfortunately.
Like I wanted so badly.
(laughter) All right, you may take the rest of your turn.
-TRAVIS-
That hurt! I will cast Spiritual Weapon at 3rd-level.
-MATT-
Okay.
[cheering] Mind you, Spiritual Weapon only gets additional damage every two levels, so 2nd-level, 4th-level, 6th-level. So casting it at 3rd-level is not going to give additional damage to it.
-TRAVIS-
How about 2nd-level?
-MATT-
All right. Just letting you know.
-LIAM-
What's it look like?
-TRAVIS-
Oh, you see these little vertebrae start to form in the air and they start stacking until they create this spine and he arcs it like a whip and he goes (smacking) smacks on the top of Duckula.
-LAURA-
Tight.
-MATT-
Okay.
I'll say that you cast it in the middle of your flight movement and put it next to it.
So go ahead and make your attack strike against it.
-TRAVIS-
(singing like a bike horn) Is there a attack modifier?
-MATT-
Yeah, it's your spell attack.
New to spell casting, folks.
-TALIESIN-
We're learning so much tonight.
-MATT-
Except--
-TRAVIS-
That's 14.
-MATT-
14 does not hit.
-TRAVIS-
Shit!
-MATT-
Bounces off its mutant hide.
-TRAVIS-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
All right, finishing up Mac's turn.
That brings it to Tary and Doty.
-SAM-
I will click my boots of speed, making my walking speed 80 feet.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Tary is amazing.
-SAM-
I will-- money buys a lot of cool stuff.
[laughter] I will walk. Can I get all the way to the monk shit over here?
-MATT-
50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 80, you can get right there.
-SAM-
I can't get to monkey pants, to Farriwen?
-MATT-
Actually, if you go over this way, up and over, you can.
-SAM-
Yeah?
-MATT-
Yeah, you can get right there.
That's the extent of your movement though.
-SAM-
All right.
-LAURA-
Oh hi.
-SAM-
I will say: Welcome to the Brigade, do me proud.
And I will touch her and cast Haste on her.
-ALL-
Ooh!
-LAURA-
Thank you kindly.
-MATT-
All right, Farriwen--
-SAM-
But you must protect me because Doty's not here.
(nervous shout)
-MATT-
Speaking of which, what would you like Doty to do?
-SAM-
I can't command him to do anything because I used my bonus action to click my boots of speed.
-MATT-
Oh, that's right, yeah.
-SAM-
So he just hangs.
-MATT-
Okay.
So that finishes your turn. Top is Lionel.
Lionel is slowed so he cannot use his multiattack so he only gets one strike.
His movement is halved, I believe.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
For Slow, yeah.
So he's just going to shift.
-LIAM-
His AC is down, movement's halved.
-MATT-
Two, make one strike at Buddy.
That is a let's see here, make sure we're getting all that.
Make sure I'm not missing any elements of the spell here, bear with me just a second.
Yep, that's a 25 to hit.
Against you, Buddy.
-LIAM-
Oh, that hits.
-MATT-
That's going to be 16 points of slashing damage.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
And that is the end of Lionel's turn.
Makes wisdom save at the end of his turn to see if it gets rid of it.
With the penalties on it, it brings it to 15.
What was the spell save on your bard? Hazel?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, oh, oh, 17, I think.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, so maintained slow on Lionel.
-MARISHA-
17, yeah.
-MATT-
All right, Damian, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so I'm going to keep attacking this thing.
-MATT-
All righty, go for it.
-ASHLEY-
This big ass duck.
Yeah, okay, so first hit is going to be a 25.
-MATT-
That definitely hits.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Let's do this one, let's do this one.
Let's do these two. Okay. Oh, I rolled so low.
-LAURA-
You have a duck.
-MARISHA-
I am waiting to use it.
-ASHLEY-
16 for the first hit.
-MATT-
16 damage, nice.
-ASHLEY-
Second hit is (stammers) 28.
-MATT-
28 hits.
-TRAVIS-
Come on, come on.
-MATT-
Getting those hits on.
(dramatic music)
-ASHLEY-
28.
-MATT-
28 damage?
-ASHLEY-
Points of damage.
That, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
-SAM-
Damn.
-ASHLEY-
Hold on, hold on, hold on--
-SAM-
Quack, quack, motherfuckah.
-ASHLEY-
Hold on.
Yeah.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
I was like, there's way, what'd I do wrong.
Okay, and third attack.
-MATT-
Third attack, go for it.
-ASHLEY-
That would be 21.
-MATT-
21 hits.
Dang, Damian taking no prisoners.
-ASHLEY-
This is with the flaming?
-MATT-
With your off hand.
-ASHLEY-
With my off hand.
Because I didn't do flaming for the second one.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Should I have?
-MATT-
That's fine.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
I don't know which one I just rolled.
-LAURA-
This is music is-- (scatting)
-MATT-
Dice, dice, dice, adding numbers, dice.
-LAURA-
I like to think that Owlbear is just--
-ASHLEY-
Nine, nine, nine.
-MATT-
Nine, all righty, nine damage.
All righty, does that finish your turn, Damian?
-ASHLEY-
You know what, hold on.
-TALIESIN-
That's a big duck.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that's a big duck. I can't get out of--
-TALIESIN-
Quack, quack motherfucker.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Can I move, but I'll get a reaction? Yeah, it's going to get a reaction against me.
-MATT-
You get the sense that its tentacles have quite a reach, so you might be able to move around within a short radius of it, but if you leave that radius at any point--
-TRAVIS-
How much of a reach?
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to stay.
-MATT-
Okay, at the end of your turn it's going to use a legendary action to duck tentacle you, Damian.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
To duck tail you?
-MATT-
Duck tentacle.
(like Duck Tales theme) Duck tentacles, ew.
(scatting) It's a 20 to hit.
-ASHLEY-
That hits.
-MATT-
All righty.
You, Damian, suffer immediately.
16 points of bludgeoning damage and make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-TRAVIS-
Oh no.
-ASHLEY-
16 points of bludgeoning?
-MATT-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
Strength?
-MATT-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, I can roll that again.
Ah, same.
-LIAM-
Same number.
-ASHLEY-
16.
-MATT-
16?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
You manage to avoid the grapple again.
-ASHLEY-
Get the fuck outta here! [cheering]
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes your turn. Owlbear, you're up, buddy.
-TALIESIN-
Oh is there anything in that chamber that I can see before I bugger off?
-MATT-
You'd have to go around and take five feet to go here to check.
-TALIESIN-
I'll take five feet.
-MATT-
You glance inside. It's just a pool.
-TALIESIN-
Okay, just a pool. It didn't do-- okay, there's nothing quick.
I'm going to take the rest of my action and move--
-MATT-
You can make a more extensive search if you want to.
-TALIESIN-
No, I'm good.
Just taking a look and now I'm going to charge full speed at the duck tentacle.
-LAURA-
(singing Terminator 2 theme) With my full movement and attempt to jump on its back.
[gasping, ooing]
-MATT-
Okay, make an acrobatics check for me.
-TALIESIN-
18.
-MATT-
18, okay, you leap, skip off of Buddy and then land onto its back, right there.
-LAURA-
Tight.
-TALIESIN-
Danger right behind you, and I'm going to start.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
No!
-SAM-
D-d-d-danger?
-MATT-
God damn it, Taliesin.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
I haven't even barely gotten to the bear jokes yet. Okay.
[laughter] I'm going to take-- I'm just going to start stabbing.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
So first stab and I assume I have advantage because this thing is engaged--
-MATT-
Well, you don't get advantage for being engaged.
It just means you can sneak attack without advantage.
-TALIESIN-
Sneak attack without advantage.
-MATT-
Correct, so you could still attack it, normal attack.
-TALIESIN-
All right, that'll do.
-TRAVIS-
Or you could reckless attack and get advantage.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Does a bear poo poo in the woods? [laughter]
-LAURA-
But you already get sneak attack.
-SAM-
Does an owl hoo hoo in the woods?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, I'll take the sneak attack.
-MATT-
All right, go, regular attack then.
-TALIESIN-
Regular attack.
-SAM-
Regular attack.
-TALIESIN-
13 does not hit.
-MATT-
13 misses.
-TALIESIN-
Fine, I'll try again.
It's next attack.
That's better, 22.
-MATT-
That does hit.
-TALIESIN-
So that's-- (hooting) Grr. Yeah.
I can re-roll that, that's better.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's 10, 16, 22 points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice! [hooting]
-TALIESIN-
Then take my bonus attack as well.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-SAM-
He's smarter than the average Owlbear.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Owlbears are surprisingly smart.
I don't want to hear that kind of conversation.
[laughter] 13 didn't hit.
-MATT-
No, sorry.
-TALIESIN-
So, I'm just going to stay up there and--
-MATT-
Okay, it shakes you off of its back now and you fall.
-TALIESIN-
I glide.
-MATT-
Sorry, you glide.
[laughter] Like so much water off a giant duck's back.
[laughter] Landing behind it.
At the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and attempt to duck tentacle you.
-TALIESIN-
Sure.
-MATT-
You just stabbed it in its back. It's going to be a 27 to hit.
-TALIESIN-
27 to hit for the duck tentacle? Yeah, that hits.
-MATT-
You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage and make a strength saving throw.
-TALIESIN-
12 points halved.
-MATT-
Yep, so six.
-TALIESIN-
Six damage and I have advantage on that strength saving throw.
-MATT-
You do.
-SAM-
I will--
-LIAM-
This is the weirdest hentai.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
22.
-MATT-
Is it though?
-TALIESIN-
Evil is a mighty turducken.
[laughter] 22.
-MATT-
22, yeah you succeed.
All righty, that finishes your go.
Buddy, you're up.
-LIAM-
Well, so first of all, Buddy the ogre is breathing kind of heavily. Question, DM, potions, bonus action or action, I can't remember.
-LAURA-
Bonus.
-MATT-
We just say bonus just for our campaign.
-LIAM-
Okay, so he vaguely remembers getting handed a potion in Tary's vault and he just throws it in his mouth and starts chewing it and swallows it.
-MATT-
(crunching sound)
-LIAM-
I mean it's really little for him. Anyway, he just starts waling with his club.
(growling) We'll see what that does later.
First one is a 17 and the second one is a 21.
-MATT-
The second one hits.
-LIAM-
Second one hits, oh shit.
Okay.
That is 11 and I will use action surge to keep going.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LIAM-
First one is a 19 and the second is way higher.
-MATT-
Both hit.
-LIAM-
Yeah, all right.
That is a 12 and a 13 so he's just waling away with his Taryon branded club.
(growling)
-MATT-
Nice.
-LIAM-
And he will, no he'll stay put, he'll stay put.
-MATT-
Okay.
End of your turn, it's going to use its last legendary action to do Ground Slam. It brings up all of its tentacles at once, (slurping sound) (slamming sound) and hits the ground, everyone within five feet of it has to make a strength saving throw, so that would be Owlbear, Farriwen and Buddy.
-LIAM-
Natural 20.
-MATT-
Jesus Christ.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Wait, did you say me too?
-MATT-
Yes.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, okay.
-SAM-
I will blow a kiss to Farriwen and give her a plus four.
-TALIESIN-
10.
-LAURA-
11.
-MATT-
Owlbear is--
-SAM-
With the plus four?
-MATT-
--pushed 10 feet away.
-LAURA-
With the plus four.
-MATT-
Farriwen is pushed 10 feet away.
Beginning to be pushed out of the water.
Taryon, oh you need to make a save as well.
-SAM-
17 plus stuff.
-MATT-
17, yeah, you manage to hold it and then--
-ASHLEY-
16.
-MATT-
16, you're fine.
So you guys manage to push out of the way. The other ones who weren't quite as ready for it get thrown off balance and pushed 10 feet away from the creature.
It is now its turn.
It gets its legendary actions back.
-SAM-
Shit, shit.
-MATT-
It's going to go ahead.
You watch as it suddenly begins to inhale, its chest expanding, the gem on its back glowing brighter and brighter and it gets out this horrible-- (inhales) (extended quack) (laughter) [cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god!
-MATT-
Using its Soul Wrenching Quack ability-- [laughter] I need everybody within 60 feet of the duck to make a wisdom saving throw which is--
-LAURA-
60 feet?
-MATT-
Everybody except--
-LIAM-
Natural 20!
-MATT-
Jesus Christ! [cheering] That's everybody.
-SAM-
Five.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All righty.
-ASHLEY-
18.
-MATT-
18, and you're fine.
-TRAVIS-
12.
-MATT-
All righty.
-TALIESIN-
12.
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Natural one.
-MATT-
All righty.
Hazel.
-MARISHA-
15.
-MATT-
All righty.
Hazel, fucking Macaroni.
(laughter)
-SAM-
Taryon.
-MATT-
Taryon and Farriwen.
You are all paralyzed until the end of this guy's next turn.
-ASHLEY-
Hold on.
-LAURA-
Come on!
-ASHLEY-
Is anyone within--
-SAM-
Oh wait!
-ASHLEY-
--30 feet of me?
-SAM-
I'm going to add my inspiration.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you do have that.
-MATT-
All righty.
-MARISHA-
Please.
-SAM-
Well, no.
-MARISHA-
What? No, I gave it to--
-SAM-
That's a nine.
-ASHLEY-
Is anyone within 30 feet of me?
-LAURA-
I am.
-MATT-
Taryon and Farriwen and Buddy, yeah, a lot of people are.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to activate my cloud rune.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-ASHLEY-
Which any creature you can see within 30 feet, if they're hit by an attack roll.
-MATT-
It's not an attack roll.
-ASHLEY-
It's not an attack roll, I just realized it once I got to that part of the paragraph.
-MATT-
It's all good.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
I do nothing and I look on in sadness.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Like oh so many Unearthed Arcana.
All righty, so those of you who failed, it quakes your very being and you find your body unable to move, you are locked in place until the end of its next turn.
-SAM-
So we can't cast spells or anything, right?
-MATT-
No, you cannot move until the end of its next turn.
-LAURA-
Is this like, are we frightened, or?
-MATT-
No, you are paralyzed.
-LAURA-
We're just paralyzed out of just paralyzation not frightened-ness.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Cool.
-MATT-
Yeah.
That ends its turn.
-SAM-
Macaroni, did you get paralyzed? We are fucked!
-MATT-
It's going to attempt to move back.
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-SAM-
All of our magic people!
-MATT-
Yep, go ahead and make your sentinel attack.
-ASHLEY-
We all get attacks of opportunity?
-LIAM-
I rolled a two.
-MATT-
That's a fail. You do as well, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
And spiritual weapon--
-MATT-
Does not get--
-ASHLEY-
Never mind, I don't know what I'm doing.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Oh no, it didn't hit.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
He slipped away.
-MATT-
That finishes its turn. It is now Hazel's turn.
Hazel, you are paralyzed.
Next, it is--
-SAM-
Does she get to make a save or anything?
-MATT-
No, it's the end of his next turn.
-SAM-
Matt, why you so cruel? [laughter] [cheering]
-MATT-
Farriwen.
-LAURA-
I'm paralyzed.
-MATT-
You're paralyzed.
-MARISHA-
Dang.
-MATT-
Macaroni.
-LAURA-
Man, I was really looking forward to going.
-MATT-
You're paralyzed.
[laughter] Tary.
-SAM-
Duck you.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Lionel's turn.
Lionel is going to continue to wale upon Buddy as he is the closest to it in this maddening mind control.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
That is going to be a 16 to hit?
-LIAM-
No.
-MATT-
You turn back and just slap the blade to the side, you can see the red burning in Lionel's eyes, no impact.
-LIAM-
Hey! Why?
-MATT-
You're breaking my heart, man.
-LAURA-
I know, I know, but--
-MATT-
All right, that finishes Lionel's turn. Damian, you're up.
-ASHLEY-
(exhales) Okay.
-MATT-
Actually, at the end of Lionel's turn, I take that back, Quackthulhu's going to go ahead and take a duck tentacle attack on...
let's say, Taryon.
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-SAM-
But we're friends.
-LAURA-
It's because you're so shiny.
-MATT-
It's not within five feet of you, though, so be thankful of that.
That's going to be, and he probably has an advantage on it.
Okay, to 25.
-SAM-
Sure.
-MATT-
You suffer, Taryon, 19 points of bludgeoning damage and I believe you automatically fail a strength saving throw.
-SAM-
Sure, I can't move.
-MATT-
Because you're paralyzed.
Yep, so you are also grappled by its tentacle.
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-TRAVIS-
Shit.
-MATT-
All right, that brings us to--
-SAM-
(clenched) Doty, come help me!
-MATT-
All right.
Now it is Damian's turn.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so, I'm going to use Second Wind, a bonus action to regain some health.
-MATT-
Nice.
-ASHLEY-
Which is a d-- can I borrow a d10?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
With Owlbear on deck.
-ASHLEY-
(groans) All right, I heal 11 points.
-LAURA-
Hey man, it sucks to be taken out of the fight for a couple rounds, doesn't it?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
How do you bear it? [laughter]
-MATT-
Not to you, you have to move into the water to get to him.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Can I jump on him?
-MATT-
If you want to try.
-ASHLEY-
(nervous chuckling) All right, I'm going to move in the water.
-MATT-
All right, so you wade into the pool of--
-TRAVIS-
♪ Wade in the water ♪
-MATT-
-- dark liquid that is this pond here, getting into base to base with it. Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to try to climb him.
I'm going to try to get on him because why the fuck not?
-MATT-
Sure, make an athletics check for me.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
♪ In the water children ♪
-MATT-
Which you may have an advantage of because you're giant.
-ASHLEY-
I have advantage, thank god.
-LAURA-
Macaroni just off to the side singing.
[laughter]
-TRAVIS-
♪ Lord's giving me trouble ♪ [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
13.
-TRAVIS-
I can't move, but I can sing.
-MATT-
13, too slippery.
The water off the duck's, you know, feathered back--
-ASHLEY-
Ah its feathers are so weird. It's like it's not holding on to water. It's slippery.
It's coming off of its back.
[laughter]
-MATT-
So you can't climb him but you do still have your actions this turn.
-ASHLEY-
All right, so since I'm down there I will, I'm going to slice and dice.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that'll hit.
18 plus, 26.
-MATT-
That hits.
-ASHLEY-
Flaming tongue stiletto.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
All right.
-ASHLEY-
15 plus 20 points of damage.
-MATT-
Nice.
[cheering]
-TRAVIS-
You're crushing it.
-ASHLEY-
I took the bonus action, I moved, I tried to climb and I did that. That's probably it?
-MATT-
So you can take another attack, but your movement is done.
-ASHLEY-
Action surge.
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
I'm going to try again.
-MATT-
A lot of fighters in this group, man.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Will this be flaming tongue or the regular?
-MATT-
Up to you.
-LAURA-
Come on, Damian.
-TRAVIS-
You can do it!
-LAURA-
Take him out.
-ASHLEY-
22.
-SAM-
Oil can!
-MATT-
22, that hits.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
All right, so nine, 15, 18 points of damage.
-LAURA-
Woo!
-SAM-
Some sort of concentration check for the duck, maybe?
-MATT-
Nope, nope, that doesn't happen, sorry.
-TRAVIS-
Damn it.
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes Damian's turn, Owlbear, you're up.
-TALIESIN-
How close am I to the duck?
-MATT-
You're about five feet from it.
-TALIESIN-
So I'm going to take my five feet up and I'm going to take two reckless attacks.
-MATT-
Okay, go for it.
[hooting]
-TRAVIS-
Get it.
-MATT-
You have this giant, green, veiny duck butt right in front of you.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
I don't have a pun for that.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Yeah, I thought you didn't.
-TALIESIN-
22.
-MATT-
22 hits.
[hooting]
-LIAM-
Right in the hooter.
-MATT-
This guy's starting to look hurt, by the way, you can see like, he's starting to bleed from different areas of the wounds, the slash marks starting to show across it.
It's looking hurt.
-TALIESIN-
27 points of damage.
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-MATT-
Nice! [cheering] [hooting] [laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Then I'm going to take another attack.
-MATT-
What have you done, Taliesin?
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-TALIESIN-
That definitely hits, so.
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Pow.
-TALIESIN-
14 points of damage.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
I can move 40. Actually, I can move 35.
-MATT-
35, that'll put you right there.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
All righty, that finishes your go.
At the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and use another legendary action to, we'll say, tentacle slam Buddy.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-SAM-
Must protect Buddy.
-MATT-
26.
-LIAM-
26.
-MATT-
To hit.
-LIAM-
To hit? Oh yeah, that hits.
-MATT-
And 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
-LIAM-
All right.
-MATT-
Make a strength saving throw for me, please.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
I'll use Indomitable.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
That's good.
26.
-MATT-
Sure.
[cheering]
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
All righty, now Buddy, what are you doing?
-LIAM-
So Buddy is still looking at the half-orc who keeps trying to wale him from behind and says: Don't hit me.
Turns away and starts to walk towards the duck and steps away from Lionel.
-MATT-
All right, Lionel cannot get a reaction because he's slowed.
-LIAM-
Thanks, Lionel.
[laughter] Then he will take two swipes with his giant Tary club.
The first is a 27 and the second is a 21.
-MATT-
Both hit.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
So that is (stammers) 11 and 11, so 22 bludgeoning damage total and then he starts going: (growling) and whatever he drank (vomiting) and he just starts puking fire out onto the duck from the potion of fire breathing that he ate.
-ASHLEY-
Yes! [cheering] Come on.
-LIAM-
That is a dex save, 13.
-MATT-
15, he succeeds.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
Nobody roots for me.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
Total of 18.
-MATT-
18.
-LIAM-
So nine points of fire damage.
-MATT-
So nine points of fire damage.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
And he is, Buddy's really wheezing, FYI.
-MATT-
Gotcha.
All righty, end of your turn.
-SAM-
If only any of us were able to move.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
That's the end, yeah, all done.
-MATT-
All right.
End of your turn, going to use its final legendary action to do tentacle slam against you again, Buddy.
[cheering]
There we go.
Thank you for the support.
-TALIESIN-
Not cool.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 19 to hit.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh! [smattering of cheering]
-MATT-
All righty.
-LAURA-
Buddy!
-MATT-
20 points of bludgeoning damage.
-LIAM-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
No.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-MATT-
All right, so.
-LIAM-
I'm up.
-MATT-
It is now Quackthulhu's turn.
-ASHLEY-
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I use my cloud rune to--
-SAM-
What's that?
-ASHLEY-
That's the thing I was trying to use earlier.
[laughter]
-SAM-
What's it do?
-ASHLEY-
It's-- so you-- "When a creature you can see within," well, is he within 30 feet?
-MATT-
Yeah, he's within 30 feet of you.
-ASHLEY-
"-- is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you," shit.
-MATT-
Oh, okay.
-ASHLEY-
Is Lionel within 30 feet of me?
-MATT-
Lionel is, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Savage.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
Let's do it.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Hey, man.
I'm all about loyalty in my family.
You switch sides, you die.
[laughter]
-MATT-
All right, so that's 20 damage that you did not take.
Buddy.
-LIAM-
Yeah?
-MATT-
20 damage you did not take because instead it went to Lionel Gayheart.
-LIAM-
All right.
-MATT-
Or Chod, as some recognize.
All righty, so on its turn, it's going to go ahead and that sentinel's messing it up, it's going to attack you again, Buddy.
Because he has sentinel, it can't go anywhere! [laughter] He chose that feat, he knew what he was getting himself into! [laughter] That's cocked.
[cheering] 27.
-LIAM-
27?
-MATT-
Yes.
-LIAM-
That just barely hits.
(laughter)
-MATT-
It never gets old.
-ASHLEY-
Roll low.
That is 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Damn it.
-LIAM-
All right.
Okay.
-AUDIENCE-
(chanting) Quack, quack, quack!
-MATT-
Second attack on you, Buddy.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
[chanting continues]
-MATT-
29.
-SAM-
Come on, Mighty Ducks, we can do this.
-MARISHA-
29? [laughter]
-LAURA-
Oh no!
-MATT-
That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.
-LIAM-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy.
-LAURA-
Are you still up, Buddy?
-LIAM-
(groaning) You're still pretty.
-LAURA-
Aw.
-ASHLEY-
Oh no, Buddy.
-SAM-
Remember, you can detect his thoughts.
[laughter]
-LIAM-
I wanted to do that 20 minutes ago, but it's a willing creature and I don't think that Duckthulhu is willing.
-MATT-
It's going to attempt to move out of your melee range.
Go ahead and make your sentinel attack.
-LIAM-
(growling)
-MATT-
Go for it.
-ASHLEY-
Do I have an attack of opportunity?
-MATT-
No, it's a thing with yours.
-LIAM-
Oh, no.
-MATT-
Perfect.
It's now going to make a tentacle attack against you, Taryon.
-LAURA-
Oh no, Taryon.
-MATT-
Because you are paralyzed and you're within five feet, it's an auto-crit if it hits.
So that's 24.
-SAM-
24 points of damage?
-MATT-
No, 24 to hit.
-SAM-
Yeah, sure.
-MATT-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Do I get an attack of opportunity since I was up against him?
-MATT-
No, it didn't move out of your melee range.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
-MATT-
That is going to be 30 points of bludgeoning damage.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh.
-MATT-
And make a strength saving throw for me.
-SAM-
I can't.
-MATT-
You're still grappled, yeah.
It's going to make one against you, Marriwen-- Farriwen.
-LAURA-
Why do you keep thinking my name has an M in it?
-MATT-
I don't know.
-ASHLEY-
Marriwen.
-MATT-
That's going to be--
-LAURA-
It's a good game, though.
-MATT-
-- with advantage, 19 to hit?
-LAURA-
Oh, no, it doesn't because I'm hasted.
That's a 20 is my AC now.
-SAM-
Does that still go even though I'm paralyzed?
-MATT-
Yeah, the spell is still going.
-LAURA-
I'm like (shaking).
-MATT-
In a weird way.
-SAM-
She's the fastest paralyzed person on Earth.
-MATT-
I feel like we've encountered this once before in our gaming where someone was unconscious and hasted.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Weird stuff man, weird stuff.
-MATT-
Sure.
[laughter]
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
As it goes to strike towards you, as you're paralyzed.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
[inaudible] goes.
-MATT-
I don't fucking know.
[laughter] Doesn't make any sense, but there you have it.
[cheering] What kind of genasi are you?
-LAURA-
Air genasi.
-MATT-
Air genasi, yeah.
You toot a little.
[laughter] And it's just enough of an air buffer.
(laughter) From all the muscle constraining of being in this paralyzed state, just deflects it out of the way.
[laughter] Cool.
-LAURA-
I feel much better, though.
I've been holding it in for a while.
-MATT-
Good, good.
-TRAVIS-
(farting sound)
-MATT-
Well, that's the end of its turn.
Hazel, you're up.
-MARISHA-
Am I not paralyzed anymore?
-MATT-
Paralyzation has faded.
-TRAVIS-
Oh, thank god, fuck.
-SAM-
Oh, thank god.
-MARISHA-
In the track that I was recording, there's going to be about six seconds of me going: And then sudden-- (stammers)
-MATT-
But I need you to make--
-MARISHA-
Then suddenly.
-MATT-
I need you to make a concentration check for me for that Haste.
-SAM-
Five.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what?
-SAM-
Oh, I'm a War Caster.
-MATT-
Yep.
-SAM-
16 plus six, 22.
-MATT-
You're fine.
[cheering] Because that would've removed the Haste.
-SAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
But Haste remains, the attack misses you, some fucking how.
[laughter] All right, Hazel, what you doing?
-SAM-
It's that Darrington luck.
-MATT-
Apparently.
-MARISHA-
(kazoo) The Darrington Brigrade-- Brigade demolished the duck or continues to demolish the duck and distracty-ions dominate.
Includion--- (laughter) The mating call of Quackthulhu's distant lover.
(tone block scraping) [laughter]
-TRAVIS-
That sounded like fucking nothing.
-ASHLEY-
Do it again.
-MARISHA-
Deep from a distant dimensy-ion, he can hear the calling of his cunnilingy-us.
(groaning) And I cast Dissonant Whispers.
-MATT-
All right, saving throw is?
-MARISHA-
Wisdom 17.
-LIAM-
And thus foley was invented.
-LAURA-
It's canon.
-MATT-
23.
-MARISHA-
Fuck! [laughter] Well, even though he succeeds, he still takes half of 3d6 psychic dam-iage.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
That's not too shabby.
13 halved.
-MATT-
13 halved, all right.
-MARISHA-
Six.
-MATT-
Six points of psychic damage.
Apparently, this duck: not as horny as you hoped.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I thought this duck fucked.
(laughter)
-MATT-
We've all made that mistake.
[laughter] Especially Daisy.
-LIAM-
Yeah, he's not DTD? [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
That's a good one.
-MATT-
All righty.
Hazel, do you want to move or stay put?
-MARISHA-
Nope, I'm great.
-MATT-
All righty.
Fucking sentinel.
-MARISHA-
Hang on, wait, who's looking rough? Which one of my teammates look like they are in need of assist-iance?
-ASHLEY-
Buddy.
-LIAM-
Hi.
-TALIESIN-
That one.
-ASHLEY-
Buddy.
-LAURA-
Buddy.
Buddy's real rough.
-MARISHA-
I hear you.
[laughter] And with great resolve, you see the great ogre, Buddy get his second wind as he takes a deep breath and lunges with incredible resolve and you get a Healing Word.
-MATT-
You can't cast two spells in a round.
-MARISHA-
Fucking fuck! And he gets a bardy-ic inspiraty-ion.
-MATT-
There we go.
-MARISHA-
Is what I meant to say.
-TALIESIN-
It's d10, right?
-MARISHA-
Yes, you get 1d10.
-MATT-
Perfect, does that end your turn, Hazel?
-MARISHA-
Yes.
-MATT-
All right. End of your turn, it's going to use a legendary action to attack Buddy.
-LAURA-
Oh, come on.
-MARISHA-
You have bardy-ic inspiraty-ion.
-MATT-
27 to hit?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
That is 17 points of bludgeoning damage.
-LIAM-
All right.
-ASHLEY-
Oh boy.
-SAM-
Oh, you're okay?
-LIAM-
(groaning)
-MATT-
How many hit points do you have?!
-ASHLEY-
Nine!
-AUDIENCE-
Nein!
-MATT-
Jesus Christ!
-LIAM-
Why, are you keeping track?
-MATT-
No, I just feel like it's been a lot.
-LIAM-
111.
-SAM-
Well, how many left?
-LIAM-
I'm the tank.
-MATT-
Yeah, it's working.
-LIAM-
First time ever! [cheering]
-MATT-
Farriwen, you're up.
-LIAM-
How many left? Nine.
-LAURA-
Nine!
-AUDIENCE-
Nein!
-LAURA-
Is it possible to get on the other side of Duckthulhu, where I'm flanking him?
-MATT-
You could move to this side.
-LAURA-
That's Damian.
-MATT-
Oh sorry, that's-- You would to-- unfortunately, no, there's not enough space.
-LAURA-
Can I hop up and over him? Can I try some monk shit?
-MATT-
Sure, make an acrobatics check, this is going to be a relatively high DC.
-TALIESIN-
Ooh!
-LAURA-
Is this acrobatics--
-MATT-
Yes.
-LAURA-
-- you said? That would be 28.
-SAM-
Whoa.
[cheering]
-MATT-
I'll allow it.
[laughter]
-LAURA-
Up and over.
-MATT-
On the opposite side.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
Still hasted.
-LAURA-
So I get advantage on my attacks?
-MATT-
You do.
-LAURA-
(chuckles)
-MATT-
Well, yes you do because you're flanking with--
-LAURA-
All right, cool.
I'm going to spin my fucking glaive.
-MATT-
Do it.
-LAURA-
Okay, 17 plus 10, I think that hits.
All right.
Four plus six, so that's 10 damage, but I'm going to use my ki points to turn that into-- oh wait, shit balls, I'm going to try to Stunning Strike him.
-MATT-
Stunning Strike.
That is a 25.
-LAURA-
(groaning)
-MATT-
High constitution, this duck.
-LAURA-
I know, I know, yeah.
All right, cool, then I'm going to unarmored attack him and I'm going to use my ki points to make it, to invoke my-- what are those things called-- my Fangs of the Fire Snake.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Okay, cool.
(manic laughter) Oh yeah, that's 18 plus eight, I think that hits.
-MATT-
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
-LAURA-
All right, cool.
-TALIESIN-
Oh!
-LAURA-
Whoa, that's good.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, hold on.
All right, so that's 10 points plus another eight points of fire damage there.
And I'm going to use another ki point.
I love these ki points.
I think this is wrong.
To Flurry of Blows.
-MATT-
All righty.
[cheering]
-LAURA-
Oh, that was almost a natural 20.
14 plus eight.
-MATT-
That hits.
-LAURA-
All right, and the second one is 11 plus eight, 19.
-MATT-
Both hit.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So damage for each of those.
-SAM-
Come on, monk.
-MATT-
Just bludgeoning the hell out of this mutant duck.
-LAURA-
Oh yeah.
That is 11 plus 11, 22, plus four is 26.
-MATT-
All right, and you have an additional attack.
-LAURA-
Yes, I do, so I'm going to pop, pop.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Both, and this is still flame strikes.
-MATT-
Well, it's one more attack.
-LAURA-
I can't do, I understand.
One more hit, then.
-MATT-
So it's more of a pop.
-LAURA-
It's a, wait, so for this I could make it a Fist of Unbroken Air? Since it's another attack.
-SAM-
Unbroken air.
-MATT-
It's an extra action which you can use for one weapon attack.
Let me double check here.
-SAM-
Unbroken air.
-TALIESIN-
I don't know what this is, but I'm very excited by it.
-LAURA-
I don't know how this works.
Apparently, I don't understand how it works.
-MATT-
The action can only be used to take the attack, one weapon attack only action, dash, disengage, hide, or use an object.
So it would not be able to be used in this.
-LAURA-
I'm going to hit him.
-MATT-
Pop, let's do it.
-SAM-
Pop.
-LAURA-
A single little pop.
Pop!
-MARISHA-
(groaning)
-LAURA-
It doesn't hit, I don't think.
-MATT-
What'd you get?
-LAURA-
12.
-MATT-
12 does not hit, unfortunately, but that was a good round of damage.
-ASHLEY-
Very good run.
[cheering]
-MATT-
Macaroni.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
Not paralyzed anymore, right?
-MATT-
Nope.
-TRAVIS-
I run up behind Buddy.
30 feet.
-MATT-
That's about as far as you can get there as you're wading in the water and you're floating.
-TRAVIS-
I will use my boots of teleportation to-- [cheering]
-MATT-
To the top of Buddy?
-TRAVIS-
15 feet behind Buddy.
-MATT-
Okay, so like over here?
-LAURA-
Like him between me and fuck a duck.
[laughter]
-MATT-
Okay, so putting Buddy between the two of you?
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah, you got it.
-TRAVIS-
And I will use Cure Wounds at 5th-level.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, Buddy.
-SAM-
Friendship is magic.
-TRAVIS-
Ooh! 24, 27 hit points!
-SAM-
Whoa.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah!
-LIAM-
Mac!
-SAM-
Mac and me.
-TRAVIS-
Destroy this fucking duck.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
That's my turn.
-MATT-
End of your turn, it's going to use another--
-TRAVIS-
Oh wait, I still have my Spiritual Weapon up, can I hit him with a bonus action?
-SAM-
You just used your bonus action to do a teleportation.
-MATT-
Oh that's right you did, so no, you cannot.
-TRAVIS-
Is it a bonus? It is.
-MATT-
It is.
-TRAVIS-
It was worth it.
-MATT-
All right, end of your turn, it's going to use another legendary action to attack you with a tentacle.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-MATT-
That's going to be a 29 to hit.
-TRAVIS-
It hits!
-MATT-
You suffer 20 points of bludgeoning damage and make a strength saving throw.
-TRAVIS-
You got it, buster.
22.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, buddy.
(laughter)
-MATT-
There's a whole set of abilities against a grappled creature, and all you motherfuckers keep rolling out of grapple.
[laughter] Except for you.
[laughter] It's your turn, Tary.
What are you doing?
-SAM-
I want to finish this.
-ASHLEY-
Come on, Tary.
-SAM-
Observe, pupils.
[laughter] How a man with fabulously expensive weapons fights.
I will bonus action cast Branding Smite at 4th-level on my own weapon and I will swing my Rod of Mercurial Form down and as it swings down it turns into a sword and I will hit it with the sword.
(laughter) Which causes, hold on, 23 to hit?
-MATT-
That hits.
[cheering]
-SAM-
Okay, so that is, okay, okay, seven points plus 4d6.
From the spell.
-ASHLEY-
Come on.
-SAM-
That makes it 29 points, plus I will use Arcane Jolt to put in another 4d6.
[cheering]
-LAURA-
Oh, that was good, that's really good.
-SAM-
It's another 18 on top of that.
[cheering] And for my second attack.
[laughter] 22 to hit.
-MATT-
Yeah.
[cheering]
-SAM-
I don't think I can use the spell twice, right? That doesn't work.
-MATT-
No.
-SAM-
So I'll just roll a d8, that is another six points of damage.
Plus, I'll pump in my last Arcane Jolt.
[cheering] For another 18 points of damage.
-MATT-
(sighs) How do you want to do this? (cheering) [cheering] (cheering) [cheering]
-ALL-
(chanting) Tary, Tary, Tary!
(chanting) Tary, Tary, Tary!
(chanting) Tary, Tary, Tary!
-LAURA-
Woo! [cheering]
-SAM-
I slash through it once with my sword, but then I pause for the second strike until Doty comes closer and I say: Doty, draw this.
[laughter] And Hazel, record it.
[laughter] And I call out: I am Taryon! [cheering] And I jam my sword into it.
[cheering]
-MATT-
As your blade pierces the outside of Quackthulhu a second time, the blade itself sinks in deep. You can feel the radiating heat from the strange rock that has embedded itself and mutated it and as the arcane force bursts within like a dull thud, like a depth charge.
(explosion) You watch the duck's eyes go wide like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man at the moment they cross the streams and (explosion).
Completely explodes into a spray of green sludge that coats the entirety of the inside of this cavern.
All of you, head to toe, are now dripping with a similar like dull green ooze. This is like, we're talking early 90s Nickelodeon.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Yes.
-TRAVIS-
I wonder what the secret of the ooze is? [laughter]
-SAM-
Lionel, Lionel! Can you hear me, Lionel, is it you?
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-AUDIENCE-
Aw!
-MATT-
"I'm real sorry, man.
I don't even know what happened there, I couldn't even do anything and my duck left me."
-AUDIENCE-
Aw!
-MATT-
"Can I get you breakfast?"
-AUDIENCE-
Aw!
-LIAM-
Yeah.
You're pretty.
[cheering]
-ASHLEY-
What do you suppose we ought to do now? You think we ought to get that? It had a weird stone in its ass, so.
[laughter]
-SAM-
I guess we should reclaim that for the strange woman who hired us for this task.
-MATT-
"Whatever it is."
-TALIESIN-
The danger, like the stone has passed.
[laughter] Sorry, sorry, carry on.
[hooting]
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-SAM-
I must say, I've fought with literally the greatest adventurers of our lifetime.
-MARISHA-
This direction, please.
-SAM-
Sorry.
Of our lifetime.
-MARISHA-
Thank you.
-SAM-
And yet today I feel a special kinship with you people.
-LIAM-
Waiting on sound.
-SAM-
I don't know if it's within my rights to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway.
Today, you are full members of the Darrington Brigade and also honorary members of Vox Machina.
[cheering] If you, if you ever meet any of the actual members, though, just maybe don't mention that part to them.
I don't know if I have that right.
I do have the right to have sex with anyone in that group, though, that has been established.
But let's just keep that between us.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
Do you still want this all on the record?
-SAM-
Oh please, delete that.
(laughter) I grab the wax cylinder, I throw it in the water.
-MARISHA-
No! (laughter) I hadn't backed up that audio yet! [laughter]
-SAM-
I'm proud to have fought alongside of all of you.
Owlbear, Farriwen, Hazel, Damian, Buddy, Macaroni Samsonite.
[laughter] You've taught me what honor is and I feel like I've taught you something as well.
Let us return with our spoils, find the lady, get our 10,000 gold, and give it away.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
You just threw away the entire battle.
New cylinder.
(gasping)
-SAM-
Let's go.
[laughter]
-MATT-
As you all manage to harness up the stone, the fallen meteor, you begin to hand the leather reins to Buddy to carry it out and Lionel goes, "No, no, no, let me take it.
This thing killed a lot of my brethren today.
I'm going to honor all those tiny souls." [laughter] "With my walk of remembrance." [laughter]
-LAURA-
Aw!
-SAM-
I imagine he's walking feet out.
-MATT-
Yeah.
[laughter] Like he does.
-TALIESIN-
That's the waddle of a hero.
[laughter]
-ASHLEY-
Hey, Lionel.
-MATT-
"Yeah, what's up?"
-ASHLEY-
How do you say, "I'm sorry" in Duck?
-MATT-
"(quacking)" [laughter]
-ASHLEY-
(quacking) [laughter]
-MATT-
As the crew solemnly makes their-- [laughter] Their march back to Deastok, they deliver the awkward payload to Doolan, retrieve the money they were owed, and returned victorious to the Darrington Estate.
-SAM-
Doty, I'll need you to write out everything that happened so that I can record it on a wax cylinder for my first ever audio book.
[cheering]
-MARISHA-
Tary, we're going to be rich.
-SAM-
Well, we'll give away all the money, but yes.
[laughter]
-MARISHA-
And that concludes the thrilling adventures of Taryon Darrington and the Taryon Darrington Adventure Brigade.
(plays glockenspiel)
-MATT-
No.
That concludes but one adventure.
[oohing] But that's a tale for another time.
[cheering] [cheering] Thank you all so much for coming to this insanity.
[cheering] [cheering] [cheering] Yep.
[applause] [cheering] Thank you all so much for being incredible hosts here in Austin.
Thank you all so much for coming out and joining us for this crazy adventure.
Don't forget we love you very much and is it Thursday yet? [cheering] Night, guys.
[cheering] (laughter) [applause] [cheering]

Critical Role Campaign 3 Episode 92 "Broken Roads"
-MATT-
Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
-ALL-
(gibberish)
-TRAVIS-
We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
-MATT-
Yeah.
Missing our Sam boy.
But we are starting tonight with a word from our sponsor for the evening, Thorum.
Marisha, wherever-- (laughs) (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
What? Oh no.
-LAURA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
Oh boy.
-TALIESIN-
Oh yeah.
-LAURA-
Thank you, Sam.
-TRAVIS-
Do you need help?
-MARISHA-
Yes, please.
-LAURA-
Thank you. Sam.
-TRAVIS-
I so want to chair pull you in that.
-ASHLEY-
Get your drink.
-TRAVIS-
I just want you to eat shit in this fucking bun.
-MATT-
(laughs) Oh my god.
-MARISHA-
Mobility is real low.
-LIAM-
Eat something.
-TRAVIS-
There's definitely a chair behind you.
-LAURA-
Has that hot dog costume ever been washed?
-TRAVIS-
There's definitely a chair behind you.
-MARISHA-
It smells weird.
-MATT-
Of all hot dog costumes, it's a pretty high quality one.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
It is.
-LIAM-
Definitely looks like a hot dog.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking it looks like.
-MARISHA-
This is a hot dog.
Hi.
(laughter)
Hi. So, Sam's not here.
-TRAVIS-
You got to pull the folds back.
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's generally how it works, Travis.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Hot dog.
-ASHLEY-
There's so many things I want to do this right now.
-LAURA-
I know!
-ASHLEY-
I'm not going to do it.
-MARISHA-
I just want to say it looked different on the website, so.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
This ad is never going to start or finish.
-MARISHA-
Nope! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh no.
-MATT-
I like how it's winning.
-TRAVIS-
You can do it.
(laughter)
You can do it.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Somebody rub her forehead, please.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Now, that's getting a little weird.
-MARISHA-
So Sam's-- (growls) (laughter)
This hot dog bites back.
So Sam's not here.
So he's making me do the ad read, which I found out about about five minutes ago.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
Stop.
She's struggling.
-MARISHA-
I haven't read the script, but, okay, here we go.
(fortifying sigh)
-TRAVIS-
(mouth fart)
-LAURA-
Just pull the hot dog apart.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Oh, does this help, Laura? Does this help? (laughter)
Is this making a difference? My head is stuck.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
Are you cold? You're shivering.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
(laughing) Oh my god!
-MARISHA-
Little shiver and quiff.
So, for over a decade, Thorum has been handcrafting unique wedding bands out of everything from meteorite-- (uncontrolled snickering)
-- whiskey barrels.
They ship every ring within one business day.
[text chime and vibration] (giggling)
Sorry, it's--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I'm in your way,
-MARISHA-
It's Sam.
-LAURA-
Oh, what is it?
-MARISHA-
"Sit up straight.
You look like you're going to a Kentucky Junior Prom." Thank you, Sam.
Thank you for the critique.
(sighs) I knew we shouldn't have let him watch the live feed.
Thorum is also making minimalist watches out of meteorite, Hawaiian koa-- (laughter)
-- and California redwood, plus their line of chic minimalist pendants.
They're new, that's what these are.
And-- (snickering)
Since we know a thing or two about minimalism here at Critical Role--
-TALIESIN-
Do we? Really?
-MARISHA-
We do.
I'm going to list off some of the cool materials--
-LAURA-
Those are necklaces?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Those are really pretty!
-MARISHA-
-- Thorum uses in their rings, while-- You're interrupting my serious ad read.
-LAURA-
I'm sorry.
-MARISHA-
Cool materials that Thorum uses in their rings, while eating an entire dump cake without my hands.
-LAURA-
No!
-MATT-
Oh, no, no, no.
-TRAVIS-
Oh! Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Oh!
-LAURA-
No!
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-TALIESIN-
No!
-KYLE-
I'm sorry.
-MARISHA-
I have to eat all that?
-KYLE-
It's Sam's artistic vision.
-LAURA-
(gasps) No.
-KYLE-
I'm sorry.
-MARISHA-
I'm not-- Okay.
I'm not-- You know what, I'll just sing a jaunty little tune, okay?
-LAURA-
Is it good?
-MARISHA-
That'll be good.
-TRAVIS-
That's Play-Doh.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-

-TRAVIS-
Oh.
-MARISHA-
It's Sam, hang on.
Yeah, Sam.
[high-pitched gibberish]
No, (laughs weakly) I know I'm not a singer.
-LAURA-
Are we allowed to keep these? [high-pitched gibberish]
-MARISHA-
No, no, no, I'm not doing that.
It's incredibly gross.
(laughter) [high-pitched gibberish]
What does Thorum have to do with eating dump cakes anyway? [high-pitched gibberish]
Uh-huh.
[high-pitched gibberish] Oh, it's called caterpilling.
[high-pitched gibberish]
-LAURA-
What?
-MARISHA-
It's popular on TikTok.
-ASHLEY-
What?
-TRAVIS-
Caterpilling.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-LAURA-
What is that?
-MARISHA-
Why am I dressed like a hot dog then? It just makes no sense.
[high-pitched gibberish]
-ASHLEY-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
(offended huff) Excuse me? [high-pitched gibberish] I don't understand comedy? Okay, you know what? You know what? I can do this by myself.
All right? I went to improv school too. Okay? Yeah.
It might have been LA Connection.
Don't look it up, but you know what? (laughter)
I didn't have fucking money for your fancy UCB bullshit.
(laughter)
Okay?
-TALIESIN-
Look that up.
-MARISHA-
So. Yeah, and you know what? I may not have won two Emmys--
-TRAVIS-
Oh boy.
-MARISHA-
-- but I won the technology award in the eighth grade--
-ASHLEY-
Let's go!
-MARISHA-
-- because my fucking HTML skills were lit.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
Good job!
-MARISHA-
My MySpace page was the shit. Take that, Sam!
-TRAVIS-
MySpace page.
-MARISHA-
That's a true story.
I won the technology award!
-TRAVIS-
In eighth grade.
-TALIESIN-
She's told me.
-MARISHA-
(composed) So whether you need a wedding ring, anniversary ring, or you just want a ring that looks awesome, head over to-- It smells bad.
-LIAM-
I thought it was just me.
-MARISHA-
Head over to Thorum-- This is a hot dog.
To Horum-- To Thorum.
-MARISHA-
Head over to thorum.com--
-LIAM-
I like the smell.
-ASHLEY-
That's a different--
-MARISHA-
-- and use code CRITICALROLE.
Matt, zip zap zop back to you.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Oh no!
-MATT-
Thank you, Marisha.
-LIAM-
This is Orym's Form of Dread.
-MATT-
Yeah.
(laughter)
I hate everything about this.
-TRAVIS-
We grieve with laughter.
-TALIESIN-
That's so awful.
-ASHLEY-
Oh my god.
-TRAVIS-
That looks so good!
-LAURA-
Make it stop.
But can we eat that cake?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, you got to eat that.
-MATT-
I do not recommend that.
-TALIESIN-
I don't want to touch that cake.
-TRAVIS-
Ugh.
-TALIESIN-
Oh god.
-LAURA-
I kind of want to eat the cake.
-MATT-
You want this cake?
-TALIESIN-
No!
-MARISHA-
I want it.
-MATT-
You want this cake?
-TRAVIS-
It's like dried out avocado.
-MATT-
All right.
Thank you so much, Marisha.
How dare you, Sam.
Laura, you have some announcements.
-LAURA-
I do!
-TALIESIN-
Do you have a costume? Like a baked good?
-LAURA-
I don't.
I just have normal clothes, you guys.
We have-- Hey! We have a Mighty Nein hoodie.
(cheering)
-MATT-
Oh, that's rad!
-TALIESIN-
Ooh.
-LAURA-
You might know our Bells Hells hoodie.
-TRAVIS-
Beautiful!
-LAURA-
This is a Mighty Nein hoodie in the same style.
We got two versions.
-LIAM-
Sick!
-LAURA-
So we got this, ooh, fabulous, dark navy.
Get ready for a big change, because-- This is US and Canada.
In the UK and EU, you get a light navy version.
-TRAVIS-
Oh! (laughs) (exclaiming)
-LAURA-
Can you see how different it is? It's a little bit thicker, too.
-TRAVIS-
Zippers are different, too.
-LAURA-
Yes, yes.
So yes, this is fabulous art by Nina Matsumoto, and the Mighty Nein crest is by Crystal Sharp.
-TRAVIS-
Beautiful.
-LAURA-
Thank you to our fabulous artists.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-LAURA-
Also, you guys, I have something else to talk about that's not just merch.
We are doing, next Thursday, we're participating in Creators in Fashion.
-TRAVIS-
Hey! (cheering)
-LAURA-
It's a livestream fashion show featuring content creators and their merch lines, which is pretty awesome, and I'm excited about it.
-MATT-
Marisha will be showing off the same outfit, I think?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we're going to have Marisha walk in the hotdog.
-TRAVIS-
Louis Hot Dog.
-ASHLEY-
Tight.
-TALIESIN-
Adding some sauerkraut, some relish.
-LAURA-
We did not design this hot dog.
We will not be showing this hot dog.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
You can tune in starting at 3:00pm Pacific on the Style Theory YouTube channel and bring your questions to be answered live in chat, because we're going to do that! I know that.
(laughter)
Anyway, I'm done talking.
I'm very excited about it.
You should tune in.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
Thank you, Laura.
(applause)
-TRAVIS-
Well done.
-ASHLEY-
Woo-hoo! (laughter)
-MATT-
Marisha, go ahead.
(laughter)
-LIAM-
That hot dog costume is the exact opposite of a hot dog.
-LAURA-
Yeah, no, seriously.
-MARISHA-
I know. I know.
-LAURA-
If you stand, does it look more like a hot dog?
-MARISHA-
Not really.
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
It's like a Central Park hot dog.
-LAURA-
No.
-TALIESIN-
No, it's worse.
Somehow it's worse.
-ASHLEY-
They forgot--
-MATT-
It looks--
-ASHLEY-
The dog.
-LAURA-
You're the dog.
She's the dog.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, but--
-TRAVIS-
Oh! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
She's just a little pearl up at the top.
-MATT-
It's more like lazy falafel.
-TRAVIS-
You got it, you got it. Go.
-LAURA-
Keep going.
-MARISHA-
The finale of Candela Obscura--
-TALIESIN-
Speaking of cosmic horror.
-MATT-
Yep.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
-- Circle of the Crimson Mirror is coming next Thursday.
-TRAVIS-
Next Thursday!
-ASHLEY-
Woo hoo!
-MARISHA-
We love what this cast has brought to Newfaire, and you will not want to miss what their final investigations bring to Oldfaire.
-TRAVIS-
Oldfaire.
-MARISHA-
(mystical burbles) Remember that you can tune in any time, as each episode is standalone, but if you want to catch up, you got plenty of time.
You can do something like YouTube or podcasts or Twitch or whatever.
Liam O'Brien is killing it!
-MATT-
Yeah!
-TRAVIS-
Yay!
-MARISHA-
You're doing great!
-LIAM-
Yeah, anyway, thanks for spoiling the ending.
(laughter)
-MATT-
She is the crimson mirror.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
Are we not delving-- Well.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-MATT-
We've released a brand new update to the Daggerheart playtest material.
-TRAVIS-
Daggerheart! (cheering)

You can try it virtually with Daggerheart Nexus on Demiplane.
-TRAVIS-
Demiplane.
-MATT-
So thank you for all of your continued feedback on the game.
Such an important part of the game development process.
You've already helped us tremendously in making it even better than it was when we started, and that will continue forward as we're eager to see what you think about the latest changes.
So thank you so much.
-TALIESIN-
Open beta.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-

-MATT-
And welcome back.
So, last we left off, Bells Hells, after making contact with the Volition, agree to aid them in a number of their current simultaneous goals against the dark leaders of Kreviris in hopes of gaining information and aiding the revolution against the Ruidian tyrants.
Upon these missions, much information was gained, some dangerous circumstances occurred, and yet you survived and endured and began to flee the city as chaos began to erupt from within.
During this time, after calling towards your mother and sending her into a personal crisis about what's right and who to align with, she scattered off into the dark shadows of the caverns.
As you fled towards the surface through some of these winding rock tunnels, you were hunted by Otohan Thull, the Legend of the Peaks.
During this fight in which your terrifying foe unleashed her true capabilities, many of you fell and barely scraped back from the edge, but one of you did not.
Fresh Cut Grass, the friend and ally who had recently come to truly realize his worth sacrificed himself to save the rest of you and to fell for good the foe that had long hunted you.
In that fugue numbness of realization, you grabbed what you could, what remained of him, and what you could from what remained of Otohan Thull, continued to flee to the surface where you emerged.
There amongst the red Ruidian landscape, the distant storms roiling, Liliana descended from above, and seeing the hurt in your face and all of your faces, realized what had likely transpired.
It was here, still not truly grasping or processing what has happened and what is next, you stare upon the alien landscape and partially obscured horizon.
-LIAM-
Exhausted, but immediately trying to figure out where we are, if I recognize it, if anyone besides her mother is present, coming, are we in danger? Lay of the land.
-MATT-
Make a perception check.
-LIAM-
Rerolling the one.
That's 28.
-MATT-
28.
Glancing around best you can, and it's fairly clear in the area you are now, the dust storms currently sit at least a number of miles off, though you're uncertain how fast they're moving at a quick glance, you do not see any other figures immediately present.
-LIAM-
Are we amongst the towers that were used for lookouts--
-LAURA-
Yeah, the guard houses.
-LIAM-
-- and security, is that where we are, where we've resurfaced or are we in a place that we don't, that Orym doesn't recognize?
-MATT-
So where you've pushed out from here, one of these side caverns, you took a look behind you and you can see the base of the mountain range that encircles Kreviris and continues past it.
So you are just outside the city itself.
You do not see any immediate outposts, but you figure if you were to leave a little further out, you would be essentially out in the open, visible from many of the outposts that encircle the crown-like mountainscape that surrounds the valley at the top of the city.
-LIAM-
Directly-- Last clarification question.
Is it obvious yet the direction from where we came from to get here, to get to the city?
-MATT-
You can very easily see the Bloody Bridge, the single beam of red energy that sits in a direction which helps you orient yourself and your location right now from where you came.
-LAURA-
How do we stay out of their sight? Are there any crevices in the ground? I know there had been cracks and whatnot on the way here.
Anything to hide in?
-MATT-
I mean, if you get really close to the base of the mountain, there's probably some little alcoves you can pull in to stay out of any immediate sight.
Any larger dips or cracks in the ground where you could hide from sight are a good 500 or more feet out and would probably put you out in the open before you reach them.
-LIAM-
Where are you at? Are you able to take us underneath?
-TALIESIN-
If there's something to get down there.
I don't know what's down there.
I'm going to see what's below us.
Take a deep breath, and I'm going to--
-MATT-
(burrowing) You grind through the ground and vanish below.
While you're currently looking, Liliana is still gliding about a foot off the ground, her hair drifting.
You can feel, almost taste the energy that sparks in the air around her.
She's still just locked in on you, her face still sad.
You can see the streaks of, not sure if they're tears of sadness or anger that have since dried and smeared what dirt was along her face as she looks towards you for guidance before she looks away.
"I don't know what's going on, Imogen.
I don't know what to do."
-LAURA-
I take her hand.
I don't either.
-MATT-
"Well, y'all can't stay here.
Going to have to-- We can't stay here."
-LAURA-
Are you staying?
-MATT-
"If I go, they'll know.
What's more useful? If I leave, they'll-- I mean, the rest of them already have been tough enough to get them to trust me.
Am I more useful here to what you're doing, or am I more useful leaving it behind? I don't--"
-LIAM-
I mean, we'd sure love to know what's in your head.
-LAURA-
We don't know enough.
You said-- You said you're the vessel?
-MATT-
"As far as I understand, in order to reawaken and get to this god eater, and get to this god eater, this Predathos, there are boundaries, shells, things that imprison it within itself, set up by the gods.
I don't know the specifics.
Maybe you know better," as she gestures over to Evoroa, who is still processing and clutching with all four of her arms towards her chest right now, taking in in shock all that's transpired.
(Liliana) "What I do know is that the Ruidusborn We're part of pushing through that.
We're supposed to be what can break the final boundary.
We have something within us, something that the gods can't stop, and only we can truly reach him.
From what he said, in order to get it beyond and back into our realm, it needs a vessel, something to carry it past that threshold."
-LAURA-
Then you can't stay.
-MATT-
"I'm not the only possible vessel here.
I'm afraid of what'll happen if I'm not here to try and do what I've been doing."
-LAURA-
Which is what? Control it? Try to control Ludinus?
-MATT-
"At least-- At least slow and focus what's happening."
-LIAM-
If you're used as a vessel, no guarantee you'll be in control of yourself.
If you're not the vessel, what are you going to do against a god eater? With us, we're armed with information.
-MATT-
"I ask you this in earnest.
What is it you fear about this god eater? Let's remove Ludinus from the equation.
Let's absolve ourselves of that.
What-- What are you afraid of?"
-LIAM-
Unknown consequences.
You cannot guarantee me or anyone.
You do not know what will happen if that thing is unleashed.
-MATT-
"I have had quite a few communions with him."
-ASHLEY-
Huh?
-TRAVIS-
You've had quite a few?
-MATT-
"I know.
I know you've been resistant, and rightly so.
I've told you to, but I have, and many of us, especially since coming here, we've-- We can feel and we can-- I don't think it wants us.
I don't think it cares."
-LIAM-
Ma'am, Ms. Temult, I cannot take your word for it.
-MATT-
"I understand."
-ASHLEY-
What do you think it wants?
-MATT-
"It wants to be awake, free of its endless dream.
It wants to be free."
-MARISHA-
You say it doesn't care about us.
What makes you think apathy is any better than disdain to a god eater?
-MATT-
"It's hard to explain, but there's something.
Something just feels right about the path of what it wants.
I'd say I could show you, but I think things are a little intense right now and--"
-TRAVIS-
We don't have the time.
We might've been getting one side of the story.
You saying it wants something besides god eating?
-MATT-
"It's real tired of being here and it's real angry at those who put it there and it's real hungry."
-ASHLEY-
For what?
-MATT-
"For what it naturally hunts."
-TRAVIS-
Gods.
G-O-D... S.
-ASHLEY-
(sighs)
-TRAVIS-
We got to get out of here.
We got to get away from the cities.
I know there's so much to say, but--
-MATT-
Make a perception or survival check for me.
-TALIESIN-
Pfft. Nine.
-MATT-
You cruise around for a bit and you're starting to get a little close to not being certain how long you have left on this, but I'd say after a good chunk of time, you don't sense any other helpful caverns or such.
-TALIESIN-
I would've rolled up and been listening.
Just shoulder up and--
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
The ridge line then, the base of the mountain.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's the best call.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go.
-MARISHA-
The secret.
Secret one? Yeah.
We certainly can't go to the Bloody Bridge, unless you can guarantee us safe passage.
-MATT-
"How else would you get out of here?"
-LAURA-
We'll go to the Bloody Bridge.
It's the only way out. We have to.
-ASHLEY-
Well. We could also...
-LAURA-
Go to the Bloody Bridge.
-TALIESIN-
Go to the Bloody--
-ASHLEY-
Go to the Bloody Bridge because--
-LIAM-
Are you coming with or are you staying?
-ASHLEY-
-- that's the only way to get home.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"How am I more useful to you, Imogen? If I come with you, I can't continue to tell you what's happening here.
You won't know what change has happened should you come back, how they're changing things or preparing for if not you, whoever else is behind you.
I assume a lot of Exandria is ready to come up here to unload a hellish payload of the gods' smite.
I cannot even begin to imagine."
-LAURA-
I hug her.
What if they pull you away again, though?
-MATT-
"Then you know what to do."
-LAURA-
How will we talk to you? I feel like if I try to talk to you in a dream, then they'll hear everything.
-MATT-
"I think if you're not here, we can find each other safely.
I think we can do that safely."
-LAURA-
Then stay.
You stay.
-MATT-
It's odd.
You see a combination of heartbreak and relief wash over her.
There's that glimmer in her face where you see part of her, part of her really did want to go with you.
-TRAVIS-
I don't mean to interject, just a question.
I would love to, like Orym said, believe everything that you're saying, but if you've really been trying to slow this down and we seem to know your heart of things, this whole mind stuff, they just jump in and out of people's domes.
Are they going to be able to tell your true colors now?
-MATT-
"They haven't fully trusted me because I don't think they can.
In fact, I think the Weave Mind, the Weave Mind and Ludinus have a unique dynamic the Weave Mind and Ludinus have a unique dynamic and Ludinus was the first Exandrian to make contact with the Weave Mind, about three centuries ago, from what they told me.
It was through them he was able to talk, too, about The One Who Sleeps.
But they both use each other for their own ends.
I think they do so knowingly, thinking that they'll be able to pull the final piece.
I think it's that dynamic that's helped me play the mother hen to a certain degree.
But the Weave Minds don't trust us Exalts."
-TRAVIS-
We saw them.
They saw us.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Briefly.
-LAURA-
Right before you showed up.
-MARISHA-
And what of Otohan? Was she just a rabid dog?
-LAURA-
Right after you showed up.
Sorry.
-MATT-
"Otohan was one of the possible vessels, one that I don't think we have to worry about anymore."
-LAURA-
How many more possibilities are there?
-MARISHA-
You certainly had no control over her.
-TALIESIN-
Gosh, I hope that's true.
-MATT-
"Awakened...
maybe four.
But I know they're trying to instill some of the other dormant powers to reach their true potential."
-LAURA-
How do they do that?
-MATT-
"Through turmoil.
Through training.
Ludinus often needs those, but he's not even here right now."
-LAURA-
Where's Ludinus now?
-MATT-
"I know he's on Exandria."
-LAURA-
Insight check.
-MATT-
Make an insight check.
-TRAVIS-
I'll aid you while staring at you while you stare at her.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
23.
-MATT-
23.
She's being pretty straightforward.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
Evoroa peeks up, breaks from her shaken staring and, "I think I, I think I know where he is."
-LAURA-
Great.
-ASHLEY-
How?
-MATT-
"I think I know.
Part of what I was working on with him was put on hold because-- I've been tangential to his work.
Me and a small other team, we've been assembling this, these devices he'd been bringing from Exandria, a Vanguard and other-- What's he called them? The Assembly defectors.
Gathering this tech from underneath some of the nearby factions back home for you folk and...
There'd been some problem.
Something had been taking up home in the source of these pieces, and I know he mentioned something about having to deal with this, this thing."
-LIAM-
Ms. Temult, it sounds like you know that Ludinus is a son of a bitch, and you know that Otohan has murdered many.
-LAURA-
Yeah, we got to go.
-LIAM-
You know they're not altruists, so it's hard for me to fathom why you think that whatever comes next is not bad.
Ludinus isn't doing anything if it doesn't <i>bring him power.</i>
-MATT-
"Ludinus is following a plan that was set out for him by The One Who Sleeps and The One Who Sleeps just sees him as a part of its plan.
and The One Who Sleeps just sees him as a part of its plan.
It's so hard to convey if you haven't seen or felt what I have, but--"
-TALIESIN-
It's not hard to understand at all.
I know self-delusion when I see it.
I know it myself.
You're in.
Clearly, you're in, and you're going to think you're going to be careful, but I think your worst fear is probably my worst fear.
And we've just got a fucking sample of it.
I want you to think about that and think very carefully when things start to go wrong, and they will for you.
Will you hear the mental cries of your daughter when Ludinus finally decides it's time to murder her on Exandria? Do you think that'll break through, or do you think you're going to be surprised?
-MATT-
"Do you think, should we stop all this from happening and re-seal or maintain Predathos' endless slumber, that those of us who know this, those of us who are designed to be part of its freedom are just going to be allowed to walk free? What, do you think the great temples of your world aren't going to hunt us down one-by-one 'til there's no possibility of this plan ever coming to fruition? You don't think every great politician of our world that isn't tied into this truth isn't going to try and bury each and every one of us for what we're part of?"
-LIAM-
Cold comfort for my family in the ground.
-MATT-
"I'm sorry."
-LIAM-
Are you?
-MATT-
"I am."
-LAURA-
Can I say in Orym's head: I don't trust her either, but we keep her on our side so we learn the truth.
Don't push her away.
-MATT-
"I don't fully know the depths of what the Vanguard has done of what the Vanguard has done to get where we are.
I've only come to realize the barbarism that has been explained as necessity and I'm well aware of the horrors that they are and I wrestle with that guilt in any part that I have aided unaware."
-LIAM-
Keep wrestling.
-MATT-
"I'm too deep in this to just walk away."
-ASHLEY-
I have a question.
When did you become a follower of all this? What happened enough to where you decided to leave your daughter?
-MATT-
"I went to the-- Went to the Conservatory in Jrusar when I was having these dreams, these visions.
I was afraid that it meant I was just going to bring something awful upon my family.
So I asked for some sort of guidance.
Through these studies and this research, eventually I was visited by Ludinus, who had a personal interest."
-ASHLEY-
Sure.
That makes sense.
-MATT-
"Then, if I'm going to be honest, he was a teacher.
He was a guide.
I was scared, I didn't know what was happening.
For a number of years, he helped me learn to control, to ground myself, to feel like maybe there was something, something important, something I was meant to do that could free myself of this burden and free you of it, too.
I just didn't realize what, what was being done until I was already unknowingly complicit.
Now, I'm just trying to figure out what's right and what, what can be done."
-ASHLEY-
It's never too late to leave, if you're uncomfortable.
Just putting that out there.
-MARISHA-
With all due respect, Miss Temult, we've all been through quite a lot.
Forgive any of our rash comments.
But I do fear every moment that we are here diminishes the chances of us getting out of here.
-LAURA-
We should go.
-MARISHA-
Do we have your word that you will lead us on this side?
-MATT-
"There's nothing in this world more important to me than you.
You're the reason I chose to even go on this path.
Not of your fault, but my own."
-LAURA-
Is that the truth? Because obviously, there's something more important to you.
You say you want to go home, you say you miss it.
I see you.
I see you. This is home.
-MATT-
"You spend enough time in a dark place, you forget what home looks like, and that doesn't mean the yearning is gone.
Especially when it finds you again.
-LAURA-
Don't put that choice on me, then.
You want to find your place, you come back.
If you've found it, then you can stay.
But please, help us, wherever you are.
-MATT-
"I will."
-MARISHA-
This is your chance to prove it, then.
Looks like we all have a lot to prove, make good on.
-LAURA-
How can we get away from the city safely?
-MATT-
"Give me your hands."
-TRAVIS-
(clutches) I'm in.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Evoroa reaches out and grabs in.
(forceful whoosh) There's this immediate rushing of air and sound.
(forceful whoosh) You feel this immediate impact, like someone had punched your gut, but without pain, just the air forcefully leaves your chest for a second.
Your lungs-- (gasps for breath) As you inhale, you feel the red landscape bend inward and then, (forceful expansion) as it reflexes back out, you're standing at the base of the Bloody Bridge--
-LAURA-
(gasps)
-MATT-
-- carving upward, up towards Exandria above.
You are still in the middle.
-LAURA-
Oh no.
-MATT-
You can see yourself standing there in the moment.
There are other soldiers.
There's quite a large military presence surrounding you, but none of them seem to be reacting to your presence.
-LIAM-
But at the center, within stone's throw?
-MATT-
Within a 10-foot walk--
-TALIESIN-
What?
-MATT-
-- from the Bloody Bridge.
You are right in the middle of the military encampment you landed at when you arrived at Ruidus.
-LAURA-
Oh shit.
-TALIESIN-
What the actual fuck did you do?
-ASHLEY-
What are we going to do when we get to the other side?
-TRAVIS-
Act as if-- Act as if, act as if.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
What do we do when we get to the other side?
-MATT-
"Find those who you can trust, and find me when you need my guidance.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Now go, quickly.
I can't hold this long."
-LAURA-
Oh, shit.
I got one health point.
-TRAVIS-
Let's go.
-MARISHA-
Let's go.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
-LIAM-
There's no choice.
We've got an army around us, so when we go--
-LAURA-
All right.
-TALIESIN-
I hate this.
-MARISHA-
This is not what we were-- (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
I hate this.
-MATT-
You see this faint trickle of blood curling down her nose as she's concentrating.
-MARISHA-
Does it look like she's time stopped or something? Are people--
-MATT-
It looks like their surrounding space is-- You can see guards there, but as they shift, it's super slow.
-TRAVIS-
Whoa!
-LAURA-
Oh fuck!
-TRAVIS-
Oh, her flex on them!
-LAURA-
Amazing.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, fuck her.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-LAURA-
She's so cool.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Can you learn that?
-LAURA-
I want all of her power! (laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Maybe we just harness--
-TRAVIS-
(questioning potion gulp)
-MATT-
You have a harness for that.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I think that's how you get it, right?
-ASHLEY-
Just suck up her powers.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
Just grab her by the back of the neck.
-TRAVIS-
Okay, let's go.
-LAURA-
All right. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,
-TRAVIS-
(running start and leap)
-MATT-
(rapid suction) You're all leaping, one after another, into the Bloody Bridge.
As you're stepping through, you hear in your head--
-TRAVIS-
That was clutch.
-MATT-
-- "I'm sorry." (launches) Take off into the sky.
The rushing of the energy pulling you up through the scattering sense of power itself.
You see other things going (rapid travel) coasting by from the opposite direction, as from the outskirts of the rushing red energy, like the push of a massive fire hose of magical power pushing you back towards your home world of Exandria.
It emerges and all of you (whooshes) end up now standing at the base of the Malleus Key's top
-LIAM-
At the top, the little stairs?
-MATT-
The little stairs.
You all emerge here.
As you glance around, it is evening, you're not sure where.
With some clouds in the sky.
-LAURA-
What's going on around us?
-LIAM-
Yeah, look around.
-LAURA-
I'm going to take a health potion.
-ASHLEY-
Pass Without a Trace.
-MARISHA-
Wait, what do you mean we're not sure where? We're not back at the Malleus Key?
-TRAVIS-
No, no, no.
-MATT-
No no, you--
-TRAVIS-
He was asking.
-LAURA-
Unless you have a healing spell.
-TRAVIS-
Because when we left it was all fucking--
-LAURA-
Do you have any healing spells?
-MARISHA-
Fucking crazy.
-TRAVIS-
-- getting shot at.
-ASHLEY-
Yes, I do.
-MATT-
Correct.
-LAURA-
Okay, then I'm going to--
-LIAM-
28 perception for people that could kill us.
-ASHLEY-
Let me see, let me see.
-MATT-
Yes.
Immediately, you see--
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, save that.
-MATT-
The entirety of the interior of this place is the same encampment that you saw, but there are regiments of Ruidian soldiers at the ready.
You can see there are weapons set up on the sides of this space.
This is, essentially, an evening military encampment at rest, not dislike where you left, it's just in a less chaotic space.
Nobody's looking up, nobody's noticing you at the moment.
You're not sure how long you have.
-MARISHA-
But they are patrols?
-MATT-
There are patrols.
There are probably, even at first glance for you Orym and even those around, you can see somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 to 100 different individuals that are scattered throughout.
Only a handful are walking while others are sitting and resting, and others are preparing weapons, others are just settling.
-TRAVIS-
We could try and ask to be taken to Otohan's quarters to drop off her stuff, if they haven't realized that she's dead yet.
Or we could try and walk out of here.
-LIAM-
We could also just behave like drones and walk out of here.
-TALIESIN-
Let's just drone and walk.
-LAURA-
We are still in the red gear, right?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS-
We are.
We got stopped plenty on the way down.
-MARISHA-
Does anyone have any Pass Without a Trace situation?
-ASHLEY-
I do, I do.
-MARISHA-
You do?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Let's do that.
-LAURA-
All right, so we'll try to act like we belong here and head on up and--
-LIAM-
But I can't remember, does Pass Without A Trace help us with the act casual?
-TRAVIS-
No.
-LIAM-
No, right?
-LAURA-
Yes, it does.
-LIAM-
Does it?
-MATT-
It helps with the stealthiness of it, of physically stealthing around.
As far as passing yourselves off--
-TRAVIS-
Just blending in in plain view.
-MATT-
Yeah. Into crowds, I would say that is more of, in this instance, which you're moving through here--
-TRAVIS-
Deception checks?
-LIAM-
I mean, it's helpful and you can do it when no one's looking, but the first 200 feet, it's just us passing--
-MATT-
Yeah, Pass Without a Trace is to not be seen.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
If you are noticed, then that's where more deception would come into play.
-MARISHA-
I mean, we could try and stack it, I guess.
-LAURA-
Yeah, try to be--
-MARISHA-
Might as well.
Unseen, but in a--
-LAURA-
Nonchalantly until we are noticed.
-MARISHA-
We're supposed to be here.
-MATT-
A group deception check would mean you could pass your way through here without issue.
If you do a stealth check and it fails, then you've caught attention and then the DC for deception gets higher--
-LAURA-
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-MATT-
-- because now you've drawn attention.
-ASHLEY-
So we just try to be nonchalant.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So it's up to your call.
-TRAVIS-
I think that's a--
-MATT-
Pass Without a Trace--
-LAURA-
There's too many people.
-MATT-
-- does give you a plus 10 to stealth.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
What do you want to do?
-LAURA-
There's too many people.
-ASHLEY-
I think we just--
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Pass Without a Trace?
-ASHLEY-
We just go?
-MARISHA-
Just deception?
-LAURA-
No, I think we just deception to see if we can--
-ASHLEY-
Use deception?
-LAURA-
-- try to be nonchalant.
-LIAM-
Yeah, deception, deception.
-ASHLEY-
I could try to disguise myself as a--
-TRAVIS-
I think, just to say it, I think, statistically, we have more of a chance of failing a deception check without any buffs as a group than with Pass Without a Trace plus 10.
-TALIESIN-
That's true, because I'm a negative two deception.
I'm also a giant fucking monster.
-TRAVIS-
Just to be that fucking goober.
-ASHLEY-
You're not wrong.
-MARISHA-
We can always try it and then go to plan B, which is deception.
-TALIESIN-
All right.
-TRAVIS-
Energy wise, I feel like we would try and blend in, but the mechanics are different.
-MATT-
It's up to you all.
-ASHLEY-
Yup.
Pass Without a Trace?
-LAURA-
Sure.
-MATT-
You are also descending from the top of the Malleus Key first.
-LAURA-
Which is really in the middle of everything.
-MARISHA-
Does it do a-- (spectacular entrance)
-LAURA-
Super visible.
-MARISHA-
-- when we bamf people in?
-MATT-
Yeah, there's a flash.
-LAURA-
Yeah, I don't think we can just stealth.
-TRAVIS-
You want to go for it?
-LAURA-
Yeah, we have to look--
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
-- like we belong here.
-LIAM-
It makes the most sense if we walk.
-MARISHA-
Then let's all do the thing where we surround Imogen like she could be Liliana.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Sure.
-MARISHA-
Bodyguards.
-ASHLEY-
Should I Disguise Self as a Reiloran?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
All right.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Disguise Self as a magnificent Reiloran.
-LAURA-
I'm going to tie my hair over to the side so it looks like a braid.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
Like her.
-MATT-
All righty.
So as you all, the few of you prepare yourselves visually and now as a group, begin to descend, I'd like a group deception check.
-TRAVIS-
(anticipatory laugh)
-LIAM-
Deception.
-TALIESIN-
This is where I really hope you all roll well--
-TRAVIS-
Why can't it be better?
-TALIESIN-
-- because it ain't going to be me.
-MARISHA-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
Not bad.
-MARISHA-
Okay, okay, okay.
-TRAVIS-
23.
-MATT-
23.
-TRAVIS-
Natural 18.
-MARISHA-
22, natural 17.
-LAURA-
Do we have advantage at all on this?
-MATT-
No, the DC's adjusted based on the fact that you are wearing--
-TRAVIS-
Remember that statistical thing I was talking about?
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
But advantage, like you could roll again? Is there anything like that?
-MATT-
What you got?
-ASHLEY-
11.
-MATT-
11. Okay.
-MARISHA-
Oh, boy.
No!
-ASHLEY-
No, no, no.
-TRAVIS-
Who? Who?
-ASHLEY-
No.
-LAURA-
Me.
-MARISHA-
No!
-ASHLEY-
No, no.
-LAURA-
I rolled a one.
-TRAVIS-
That's so fitting.
-MARISHA-
No!
-TRAVIS-
That's so fitting.
-ASHLEY-
We fucking just--
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) I just said it.
-MARISHA-
Somehow Chetney and I--
-LAURA-
I rolled a one!
-MARISHA-
-- are the most convincing?
-LAURA-
I rolled a one on my Imogen dice.
-MARISHA-
How?
-LAURA-
I should not have rolled my Imogen dice because I'm not Imogen right now.
-MARISHA-
Oy vey.
-MATT-
(laughs)
All right, So, as you all emerge and begin to descend the staircase that leads down from the top of the Malleus Key.
-LAURA-
I'm sorry.
-MATT-
You coasted down amongst the various ruins and the large military tents and gathered bits of materials.
You can also see other war beasts from Ruidus have begun to make the transition to Exandria.
The military defense of the Malleus Key is growing larger.
You can see the edges of the actual Tishtan site.
There are signs of massive battle.
While you were gone, it looks like either a major scuffle happened and a section of one of the inner walls of it is blown open and there's a massive cave-in landslide that happened there.
So it looks like the escalation of might and assaults on this space, or at least defense as well, shows violence is increasing.
But as you're taking these in and you begin to maneuver, you, Orym, notice that two Reilorans are gliding by.
Not walking, gliding.
What you see are two Mystics that--
-LAURA-
God, of course they recognize us.
-MATT-
-- take attention as you come down--
-MARISHA-
Mystics.
-MATT-
-- the steps and begin to pursue.
-LAURA-
Just two.
-ASHLEY-
Just two.
-LIAM-
We got a tail, I think to Imogen.
-LAURA-
Great.
-MATT-
As they begin to get closer, you also watch as they pass through groups of people.
-LIAM-
Are we all brain linked?
-LAURA-
We're not brain linked anymore because FCG is dead.
-TRAVIS-
(stress laugh)
-LIAM-
Yeah, that's true.
-LAURA-
In your head, I can say: I can fly two of us.
-MARISHA-
How close are they?
-MATT-
Right now? Maybe about 120 or so feet away.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
But they're starting to gain speed a bit, and you watch as they pass through or nearby other soldiers and Vanguard members.
They all--
-ASHLEY-
Oh fuck.
-MATT-
They're all being--
-MARISHA-
Alerted in their heads?
-MATT-
-- alerted that something's off.
-LIAM-
This is going bad.
-TRAVIS-
Going to have to give them a story.
-LAURA-
What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?
-TRAVIS-
Are we repairing Otohan's equipment?
-MARISHA-
Let's keep going until they get within 60 feet.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Just keep walking.
-LIAM-
Plan was to flip to--
-ASHLEY-
Just keep walking.
-LIAM-
-- deception. Oh.
-LAURA-
I don't have--
-ASHLEY-
To stealth? But yeah, that doesn't--
-LAURA-
There's no way to flip to stealth.
-ASHLEY-
I know. I should've done that first.
I know, I was with you.
-LAURA-
I get it, Travis!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LAURA-
We fucked up! I rolled a one!
-ASHLEY-
I know.
-MARISHA-
We got this!
-MATT-
That's how it works.
-LAURA-
I could've rolled a 20! But I rolled a one.
-MATT-
It's all good.
That's how it works.
-MARISHA-
Guys, luck is on our side.
-TALIESIN-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Let's just keep walking.
Let's just keep walking.
-MARISHA-
Keep walking.
-ASHLEY-
Keep it going.
We're good, we're going to get out.
-LIAM-
This is what's known as a lucky streak.
-MARISHA-
I feel like I still smell like that hot dog costume.
Goddamn it, just keep going.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-TRAVIS-
"Still."
-TALIESIN-
My head can't--
-ASHLEY-
Actually, you smell pretty good.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
(grossed out noise) Keep going.
-MATT-
You watch as Vanguard members begin to-- After they're essentially pinged in proximity to these Mystics, begin to reach for their weapons and begin to stand up and all begin to follow behind them.
There is a slow, growing makeshift battalion that is beginning to close in behind these two Mystics as they begin to gain on your somewhat quickened pace.
But still walking.
-MARISHA-
I tell Imogen-- When it's time, turn around and tell them they're dismissed.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
We have no need--
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
Of their support.
-LAURA-
When they're closer?
-MARISHA-
Yep.
-LAURA-
All right.
-MATT-
80 feet.
70 feet.
60 feet.
-LAURA-
I stop walking.
-MARISHA-
I cast-- I Twinned Spell.
Oh my god, I hope this works.
Twinned Spell, Phantasmal Force.
-MATT-
Okay.
-MARISHA-
It's my last 2nd-level spell.
And what they see is Liliana Temult.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ASHLEY-
Nice!
-MATT-
All right.
Spell DC on this? This is intelligence saving throw?
-MARISHA-
18.
-LAURA-
Oof.
Intelligence.
-MATT-
18.
Ah, natural six.
-LAURA-
Ah!
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
What's the second one?
-MARISHA-
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just want this spell to work once this campaign!
-LIAM-
Smart idea.
-MATT-
So you turn around, mutter a bit beneath your breath and release the invisible bonds of the spell against their minds to ensnare their perception.
What do you do, Imogen?
-LAURA-
I turn around and I look at them.
No need for an escort.
You're dismissed.
-MATT-
Both of them stop.
And drift around the opposite direction.
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-MATT-
You watch as the--
-TRAVIS-
Body shot, body shot, body shot!
-MATT-
The rest of the gathering crew slowly--
-TRAVIS-
(laughs)
-MATT-
-- dissipate, shake their heads a bit, shake free of the brief influence calling their attention.
-LIAM-
That was super smart.
-MATT-
They all begin to scatter back to whatever they were doing.
-MARISHA-
I'm out of sorcery points.
-LAURA-
And we--
-MATT-
You out of sorcery points now?
-ASHLEY-
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
-MARISHA-
That's it, that's it.
-LAURA-
♪ And get up and out of ♪
-MARISHA-
Still got some spells, but--
-LAURA-
♪ Here please ♪
-MATT-
All right, you begin to trek up--
-ASHLEY-
Keep walking, keep walking.
Keep walking.
-MATT-
-- the nearest incline that guides up the side of the tall Tishtan Excavation walls.
Heading up that way, you see one of the large warders, like (stomping sound).
Heading down, you have to move to the side as it gets near.
-LIAM-
That's a tall drink of warder.
-MATT-
(stomping)
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-MATT-
It walks by and takes in your troop.
He continues walking.
(stomping)
-LAURA-
If we look around, do we see Planerider Ryn? (laughter)
Do we see a statue? Do we see an armless statue anywhere?
-TRAVIS-
Moved to a place of convenience on the way out.
-MARISHA-
Yeah, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Just as a hat rack.
-LIAM-
A potted plant.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-LIAM-
Just decor outside a tent.
-LAURA-
Anywhere? Just anywhere.
-MATT-
Roll a perception check.
-LIAM-
My eyes are so good.
My eyes are so good!
-MATT-
Yeah, both of you roll perception.
-LIAM-
I'm always looking.
-LAURA-
We're just rolling.
-TRAVIS-
Just don't roll a one.
-LIAM-
30.
-MATT-
30?
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Pretty good.
-LAURA-
Oh, that's better than my 15, but I still rolled 15.
-MATT-
Still pretty decent, yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I ain't looking.
-MATT-
You actually feel pretty confident that she's nowhere--
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
-- around the Malleus Key.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
You also are pretty confident you don't see any pieces of her, you don't see any signs of a shattered statue.
-TRAVIS-
(laughs) What about a toe?
-LAURA-
Okay.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
A stony toe?
-MATT-
But, while this is where she was turned to stone, you get the immediate sense that she's been relocated.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
Why is that woman dressed like a hotdog? LAURA, MARISHA,
-MATT-
(laugh)
-TALIESIN-
Who knows why mad people--
-TRAVIS-
It's so uncomfortable.
-TALIESIN-
-- do what they do.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Orym rolls high enough to see into the real dimension.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs) "Why do they have dice? What does that mean?" (laughter) (lingering laughter)
-LAURA-
Atreyu, call my name! (laughter) (laughter)
-TALIESIN-
(sighs pleasantly)
-MARISHA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
What an existential crisis everyone would have.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-LAURA-
Oh, it's Bastian.
My bad.
-MATT-
Yep, Bastian.
-LIAM-
(sighs pleasantly)
-LAURA-
Okay.
-LIAM-
How dare you?
-LAURA-
How dare!
-MATT-
"Moonchild!" Which you can't even hear in the movie.
-LAURA-
I know, yeah.
-MATT-
Anyway.
Eventually you push past and get up to the edge.
-TRAVIS-
♪ Moonchild ♪
-MATT-
Looking up, you can still see the beam of the bridge coasting up to the red Ruidus moon.
You can see some of the heavy clouds that looks like a storm just passed over maybe a few hours before, and is now moving away.
The open night sky, the welcome sense of familiar air, and being outside of the immediate space of tension is very, very welcome.
You, looking around the perimeter, can see multitudes of defensive weapons that have been set up.
Some look like there of a Ruidian make, some of them have been moved from other parts of Exandria.
There are multitudes of designs, different cultures pulled together, as well as some unique cobbled weaponry that you're not entirely familiar of how they would function defensively or aggressively, offensively even.
But you recall the basic direction of where you were brought here from the west-side encampment where you were carried via Keyleth.
Looking at the vicinity of where things are set, Orym, especially with that 30 perception, you'd know which direction is west from here and what would get you probably closest to that encampment.
-LIAM-
Okay. All right, so I'll point that out.
Are there still skyship wrecks all around as we move through that? I remember that.
-MATT-
Oh yeah.
There's a unique graveyard around the exterior of the excavation site that includes numerous destroyed skyships, numerous destroyed military siege weapons and wagons.
As you continue to walk through, not being bothered by any of the exterior watchers who don't immediately take any sort of interest in the robed figures, slowly doing a perimeter around the southern edge.
The only time that they would probably draw any attention is when you just start walking out into darkness as a troop.
But as you pass through here, you can see all matter of large craters that have slammed into the surrounding ground.
Signs of mass detonations, the land itself scarred by recent battles.
You see bits of armor.
You recall before seeing this.
You can see along the outside there are pikes that are adorned with trophies.
You see different temple-themed armor sets, You see different temple-themed armor sets, pauldrons and chestplates that are adorned with the symbol of the Moonweaver.
You can see holy symbols that are hung on the edge of iron spikes that are jammed into the ground that hang and dangle, where at the end of the chain, you see swinging a medallion of the Duskmaven.
You can see all manner of captured holy imagery You can see all manner of captured holy imagery that now is set upon the outskirts of this site as a warning and as a sign of pride that any who steps beyond--
-MARISHA-
Do see--
-LIAM-
Changebringer?
-MATT-
-- stops here.
-MARISHA-
Do we see any symbols of the Changebringer?
-MATT-
With your perception, it takes a little bit of a walk and you have to get a little close to the edge to really pick it up with as little light as there is.
But you see along one of the torches that matches the perimeter there, one of these ever-burning magical torches flickers, you see the familiar sight of what looks to be a cloak that, as it hangs tattered and torn as it flows with the occasional breeze, you can see the familiar symbol of the Changebringer, her face still standing there from the side, looking off to some unknown horizon.
-LIAM-
I'll grab it.
Can we find a place to lay low for a little bit?
-TALIESIN-
We're not there yet.
-LAURA-
Yeah. I am going to-- I still have 3rd-level left and I don't know if it'll work here, but I'm going to try Sending.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LAURA-
See if I can send a message to Keyleth.
We're back.
We're at the surface of the Malleus Key.
Just trying to find a way to get back to you.
-MATT-
Doesn't take too long for her to respond.
"(sigh of relief) That is wonderful news.
I'll be at the encampment as soon as I can.
Can you get there safe? Oh, that's not how this works.
(stammers) I'll--" (laughter)
-LAURA-
I love it!
-MARISHA-
40 years using this spell and still don't fucking got it.
-ASHLEY-
Shit, yeah.
-MARISHA-
"Aw, fuck.
That's right.
Ah, fuck." (laughs)
-TALIESIN-
Wait, does that count--
-LAURA-
The encampment, the encampment, the encampment, the one we were at before?
-TRAVIS-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Yeah, it was one of a number of encampments that had been built on the outer perimeter of the Hellcatch surrounding the space where a lot of the--
-TRAVIS-
Staging grounds?
-MATT-
Yeah.
Where what military might is being spared at the moment from different nations and city states and such are being sent in preparation to both keep an eye on the site and, previously, help give you the smokescreen to make your infiltration.
-LAURA-
Is it evening, did you say?
-MATT-
It's evening, it's dark.
-LAURA-
Okay, so it is getting dark.
So we can stealthily maybe make our way out.
-TALIESIN-
At some point, we're going to hit it.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
From where you're standing now, this would be a great time for--
-TRAVIS-
Are you sure you don't want to use a deception check to try and get around?
-LAURA-
Hey, fuck off.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
"Hey." (laughter)
-MARISHA-
I love that. "Hey."
-TRAVIS-
"Hey."
-TALIESIN-
"Hey."
-ASHLEY-
"Hey, fuck off."
-TRAVIS-
Yeah?
-LIAM-
They were such a cute couple.
-MARISHA-
Yeah. (laughs) (laughter)
#goals.
-LAURA-
Hey.
(laughter)
-TRAVIS-
(slow-mo knockout) K-O.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
But you still have a Pass Without a Trace.
-ASHLEY-
I do.
-LAURA-
So we could use that as we wander away.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, I do, I do.
-TRAVIS-
Just like you planned it. (laughs)
-LAURA-
Just like I planned it.
-ASHLEY-
Just like we had talked about, and we're going to do it now.
-LAURA-
It doesn't matter, Marisha saved the day, and it's fine.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
We could've done it before, we're going to do it now.
It's no big deal.
I'm going to do it right now, Pass Without a Trace.
-MATT-
Okay, so you cast Without a Trace, the shadows cling to your robes.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Can I get a group stealth check from you all, plus 10 to your final rolls.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Okay.
♪ (waggles tongue) ♪
-TRAVIS-
(laughing) That's what I get.
That's a one.
-LAURA-
Did you roll a one? Did you roll a fucking one?
-MATT-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
No way.
(laughter)
No way! (laughter)
-LAURA-
That is karma!
-TRAVIS-
That's so appropriate.
-LIAM-
(chanting) That's just right.
-ALL-
(chanting) That's just right.
-MATT-
All right, so we got a one over here.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-LAURA-
Wow.
-MATT-
Wonderful.
-TRAVIS-
Wow.
-MARISHA-
29.
-TRAVIS-
You dick!
-MATT-
29, okay.
-ASHLEY-
Damn!
16.
-MATT-
16, okay.
-LIAM-
You're a shadow.
-LAURA-
28.
-ASHLEY-
Okay, great.
-MATT-
Okay.
-LIAM-
22.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TALIESIN-
24.
-ASHLEY-
Great, great, great.
-MATT-
24, okay.
(laughter)
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to spend some time--
-ASHLEY-
Hey.
Fuck off.
-TALIESIN-
-- jumping in the pool.
(laughter)
-MATT-
Okay. I'd say about now it's starting to wear off, because you guys have taken the time both slowly coasting around the outside of this.
So you start diving in for a bit and you feel like the ground's getting more resistant and it makes you feel a little nervous to continue.
-TALIESIN-
I'm going to take what I've basically been using as some nice quiet scream therapy.
-TRAVIS-
Aw.
-LAURA-
Aw.
-ASHLEY-
Aw.
-TALIESIN-
Jump back up and turn into crystal.
-MATT-
Okay.
-TRAVIS-
You forgot Vowels.
-MATT-
(sadly) Oh.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MARISHA-
No Letters.
-ASHLEY-
I probably have dropped mine as well, because I'm sure I wasn't walking around all like-- (aflame)
-MATT-
Correct, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's actually pretty valid.
Thank you for reminding me.
I assumed you might've wanted it.
So you both do take your two points of exhaustion.
-LAURA-
Woof.
-TALIESIN-
Yep.
-ASHLEY-
Okay.
-MATT-
Which it does wind you and your speed is reduced because of the exhaustion.
-ASHLEY-
I am so fucking tired.
-MATT-
So you're traveling-- The rest of the group is traveling at the speed of your slowest members.
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
Which would be Fearne at half speed right now.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah, that's right.
-ASHLEY-
Half speed.
-LAURA-
So we're limping away--
-TALIESIN-
15.
-LAURA-
-- from this horrific experience.
-MATT-
Correct.
-MARISHA-
I mean, that's about right.
-TALIESIN-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Except Chetney.
(galloping footsteps)
-ASHLEY-
35 feet. Yeah.
-LAURA-
Skipping.
-LIAM-
Oh, he's gone.
-TRAVIS-
(runs into distance)
-MATT-
As the shadows do enswirl your troop and you peel off from what was the feigned perimeter walk of your group from the site, you begin to make a western beeline in the direction where you hope you'll be able to see the encampment.
The tension begins to fade after about five or so minutes when you do not see any of the other perimeter guards following suit or taking note of your divergence from the site.
Now, as you all quietly walk under the stars of the Exandrian sky in silence, looking across the distant rocky barren horizons of the Hellcatch, really the first moment hits in where you get to begin to process what you've lost.
-LAURA-
I'm going to turn around and look up at the moon.
(sighs) That was awful.
-LIAM-
We're still just wandering the desert en route to this encampment? That's where we're at?
-MARISHA-
He didn't have to do that. Letters.
-TALIESIN-
He had been itching to do that since the day I met him.
-MARISHA-
It's funny, it's the first thing I thought about, Ashton.
-TALIESIN-
I knew he was just going to pull that shit.
God fucking damn it.
-MARISHA-
I remember your warnings to him.
-LIAM-
I've seen enough fights go south.
If Letters hadn't done that, we'd all be dead.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I know.
-MARISHA-
I just felt like we were so close, we could've had her.
We don't know that, you don't know that.
-LAURA-
She was too strong.
He saved us.
-TRAVIS-
He made it count.
We've got to do the same.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
I can be angry at the same time.
Those are really easy to hold together.
(sighs) That little fucking...
(angry grunt)
-ASHLEY-
Where are we going?
-LAURA-
Back to Keyleth.
We have to tell them everything we learned.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
We need more help.
-LAURA-
I hope we made the right call with Liliana.
I hope we made the right call with Liliana.
-TALIESIN-
You were never going to get her to--
-LAURA-
She would've come, I think she would've come, but I didn't trust her.
-MARISHA-
I think it's smart to give her this opportunity to prove herself.
You've been without your mother for so long, what's a few more months if it gives us the advantage?
-TALIESIN-
It wouldn't have worked.
-LAURA-
I know.
-TALIESIN-
She would've come because you said so, that just is a fucking disaster.
-LAURA-
I feel like--
-TALIESIN-
Fuck.
-LAURA-
I feel like that shit with Ludinus, I think she-- I think she doesn't support him, I do believe that now.
-LIAM-
Mostly.
-LAURA-
I felt that hold, though, that Predathos has, I felt that welcoming warmth that she spoke of.
And she's been there so long.
-LIAM-
Yeah, she clearly has her criticisms of Ludinus, although that sounded pretty tangled, too, her history with him.
But she definitely seems like a believer in Predathos.
-LAURA-
I think it's more than that, I think-- I think he's part of us.
We're his children, right?
-MARISHA-
Yeah, that bit she said at the very end, that this is what you were designed for.
-TALIESIN-
That hit you, too, didn't it?
-MARISHA-
Yes.
It made me think of FCG, and it also, I feel like I owe you an apology.
I feel like I understood your mom on a deeper level in that moment.
I think it's just reminiscent of something that sounds like we all struggle with, not being able to supersede that feeling of being designed, controlled, manipulated.
(sighs) But it also just made my heart break for her.
Feels like we've been very privileged to go on a journey guided by FCG to learn more, that we're more than just what our creators intended for us.
that we're more than just what our creators intended for us.
And I don't think she's had that.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
Made me sad and grateful at the same time.
-ASHLEY-
Mm.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
It made me angry.
I don't like being angry.
You're too fucking good for her.
She doesn't deserve this fucking world.
I hope she's right.
Really do.
I hope her ends are fucking great because these means are just not forgivable.
-LIAM-
Chetney.
Where's Otohan's shit?
-TRAVIS-
Here.
-LIAM-
Lay it out.
-TRAVIS-
(bangs)
-LIAM-
Lay it out.
I walk over and I pick up the sword, one of them, I jam it in the soil.
That is the blade that killed my father and my husband.
She is not right.
I'm going to walk away from this group for a little bit.
-TRAVIS-
(sighs)
-MARISHA-
Imogen?
-LAURA-
Yeah?
-MARISHA-
I love you.
-LAURA-
I love you, too.
-MARISHA-
I love all of you.
Just perhaps we should say it more.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
FCG was so unique.
I mean, every time someone saw him, they reacted like they'd never seen such a thing before.
But your mom left us with such an interesting tidbit of info, that Ludinus was on Exandria overseeing the pieces of machinery that were being brought up.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
Yeah, I turn to-- Aw, fuck, what's her name?
-MATT-
Evoroa.
-LAURA-
Evoroa, sorry.
-ASHLEY-
Oh shit, I forgot she was here.
-LAURA-
(laughs) Yeah, Evoroa just like, "Eee."
-ASHLEY-
Welcome.
-MATT-
(laughs) She's like, "It happens a lot, actually." (laughs)
-ASHLEY-
Sorry.
-MATT-
"It's fine."
-LAURA-
Chetney's going to fuck you, I have a feeling later.
I don't really say that out loud.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-LIAM-
Is this the first-- Above table, I know that there are the floaty beings, but one of the Bormodos?
-LAURA-
Yeah, the first--
-LIAM-
We've never seen a Bormodo on Exandria?
-LAURA-
Uh-uh.
-MATT-
No.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, this would be a big deal.
-MATT-
You can see her, while you guys have been having this conversation, she's a little bit behind you and is just taking it all in.
-TRAVIS-
Oh shit, right, fuck.
-LAURA-
Aw, shit.
-ASHLEY-
Welcome to Exandria.
-LAURA-
Sorry.
-TRAVIS-
Welcome to the Blue Dream.
-MARISHA-
Promise.
-LAURA-
The Blue Promise.
-TRAVIS-
Promise?
-LAURA-
Yeah.
It's not blue right now.
-MATT-
"No, it's not at all."
-LAURA-
But there is some, I swear.
-TRAVIS-
What do you think of the sky?
-MARISHA-
It's not normally like that.
-ASHLEY-
That's where you lived.
-MATT-
"It's so much smaller from here."
-LAURA-
(laughs) Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
It's had some work done.
Things are weird out here right now.
-ASHLEY-
There's some prettier, better spots here.
-TRAVIS-
We're going to find friends, people that you can trust.
But until then, just keep a low profile.
-MATT-
"Of course, no--"
-TRAVIS-
Take your time.
-MATT-
"I will.
Thank you all so much for helping get me out of there."
-LAURA-
Of course.
Thank you.
-MATT-
"I haven't done anything yet."
-LAURA-
I have a feeling you will.
-MARISHA-
I'm assuming those machines that Ludinus was dragging up to the moon have something to do with what we found in that crate.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-MARISHA-
With the Cerberus Assembly marking.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, that's right.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, I want to get all this stuff to Imahara Joe and--
-LAURA-
Mm.
-TRAVIS-
I feel like there's more there.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's-- This feels like morning problems.
-LAURA-
He said you knew where Ludinus was.
Do you have a city name? A location?
-MATT-
"Yeah.
I don't know where it is, but he's referred to it a few times."
-LAURA-
What did he say?
-MATT-
"It's called Aeor.
It's where he's getting all these things and where we--"
-ASHLEY-
(exhales)
-MARISHA-
Is that where he is now?
-MATT-
"I don't know where else he'd be."
-MARISHA-
You mentioned he ran into problems?
-TRAVIS-
Motherfucking--
-LAURA-
Fucker!
-TRAVIS-
-- Matt Mercer.
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
"I'm sorry, what was your question?"
-MARISHA-
The Cerberus Assembly's been obsessed with that Aeor shit.
-TRAVIS-
MFMM!
-LAURA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
MFMM?
-LAURA-
That's a T-shirt.
-TALIESIN-
#NewTattoo.
(laughter)
-ASHLEY-
Wait, what? I don't get it.
MARISHA and LAURA: Motherfucking Matt Mercer.
Oh!
-TRAVIS-
(sighs)
-LAURA-
Okay.
-MATT-
You see her start-- Her awe shrinks in as she starts getting technical and you can see why she was chosen for this in the moment.
There is a curiosity and a passion for this element of her intellect, though as unfocused as she might be at the moment.
She goes, "Well, so a lot of this tech was being brought in there.
We were able to combine it with some of our initial designs of shifting and changing up our developments for various war implements here on Ruidus.
They had developed a lot of things based around this thing, this Malleus Key he was talking about, and it was-- So part of my thing was to help originally to design tools that were used to burrow through the outer layers of the glass pillar where Kreviris was."
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
"It's an impossibly thick layer of glass, but the Exaltants, when they came in here and began to consult with us alongside Ludinus, they began to speak as they communed with the being of the planet, moon, I guess, to you. (laughs) There are multiple layers to this glass.
The outer layers were simple enough to get through with some of this tech, if we designed it, but the secondary layer that we got through was like adamantine.
It seemed like it had some sort of a divine magical origin in its construction.
You know, our standard designs were too slow in trying to get through there, given the rapid timeline of what was going on and mounting opposition from Exandria.
As you said, across the bridge was starting to grow tension, so Ludinus was going to go back to seek out what tech was available.
It was supposed to be--"
-LAURA-
In Aeor?
-TRAVIS-
Metal.
-MATT-
"From Aeor.
There's supposed to be a continued source of it being excavated from his troop, his Vanguard, his allies, but there was a problem there.
Something called, he called it the Dominox.
It--"
-LAURA-
Dominox?
-MATT-
"It had begun to take up root there, was causing struggles with their excavation, and so he was going to take care of it himself."
-TRAVIS-
Whoa.
-MATT-
"That was just a few days ago."
-MARISHA-
The Dominox is what took up root--
-TRAVIS-
In Aeor.
-TRAVIS-
It's messing up the--
-LAURA-
So wait. So he went to go fight some big, powerful thing, right?
-TRAVIS-
Some bad bitch called the Dominox.
-MARISHA-
Who's--
-LAURA-
What if it weakens him enough that we pop in?
-MARISHA-
(hyperventilates excitedly)
-LAURA-
And then--
-MARISHA-
We're like, bam, bitch!
-ASHLEY-
(hyperventilates excitedly)
-MARISHA-
Oh god.
-TRAVIS-
Yes.
-MARISHA-
Wait.
-TALIESIN-
Slowly, you're going to hurt yourself and fall unconscious.
-MARISHA-
Did Ludinus mention if Dominox is a big beasty? Or is it like a group of things?
-TRAVIS-
Let them s--
-MATT-
"I barely caught just the tail end of that conversation."
-LAURA-
Maybe, maybe--
-TRAVIS-
Evoroa, keep going. Ignore us.
We're just, we're stopping--
-LAURA-
Maybe Keyleth knows something about Dominox.
-MARISHA-
(hyperventilates excitedly)
-LAURA-
Have we ever heard of Dominox?
-MATT-
You've never heard of Dominox.
-MARISHA-
Keep going!
-LAURA-
It's just icing now.
-MARISHA-
This is all gold!
-TRAVIS-
Story time.
-TALIESIN-
I cannot follow any of this.
-LAURA-
I know.
-MATT-
"Anyway, from what we were understanding, there were certain implementations of magical synergies and the technology that was being presented as part of our study group, that the tech had a unique understanding of the weave of godly magics, divine-type magics, and how to unravel them on a very base core point."
-MARISHA-
Oh. Okay.
-MATT-
"So this was the basis of our project, a means to penetrate the secondary glass shell that contains Predathos within.
So taking inspiration from the, what's it called? The Malleus Factorum--"
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-MATT-
"-- and the other trickles of nearby tech and essentially develop it in a smaller scale that we'd be able to go through these additional layers of the--"
-MARISHA-
The god adamantine stuff?
-MATT-
"Yeah."
-LAURA-
Oh.
-MATT-
"So, apparently the glass veins
"So, apparently the glass veins that run through the planet are the remnants of Predathos' last form when it was locked--"
-ASHLEY-
Oh.
-MATT-
"-- within its prison--"
-LAURA-
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.
Can I pull out the--
-TRAVIS-
(shouts) We need to stop interrupting the story!
-LAURA-
I'm sorry. I just wanted to-- Okay, cool. Go, go.
-TALIESIN-
They're never going to stop there.
-MATT-
"So, yeah.
That's the theory."
-TRAVIS-
Oh!
-LAURA-
I'm sorry!
-TRAVIS-
Jesus!
-LAURA-
Well, can I pull out the little globe-y thing that we got? The little globe-y. Oh, that's in the bag of holding.
-MATT-
It's in the bag of holding.
-LAURA-
Okay, never mind.
-MARISHA-
(grunts in suggestion)
-LAURA-
Look, oh, these look like-- Wait, how is this--
-MATT-
"No, right.
That right there.
So, we've been unable to map deeply without the help of the Exaltants, and when they are able to connect with the aid of the Weave Mind to deeply bind with the essence of Predathos, they were able to feel out the extent of the vein network.
We were uncertain of the source.
Just we knew they were resonant with The One Who Sleeps, but from what we're gathering, that was likely a reflection of its form when it was sealed away, so the glass is what its body once was then turned to be its own prison.
So whatever it is sleeping within is within its own glass prison and the layers between, and that's where the tech and the Exaltants, that's where all of this is supposed to come together is to break past these boundaries and then free it from its prison shell of what it once was.
Yeah!"
-MARISHA-
Would you know about this whole vessel business? Is it basically going to possess one of the Exaltants so that it could walk across?
-MATT-
"That I don't know."
-MARISHA-
Yeah, okay.
-MATT-
"They keep us all siloed.
I only know what I can because I was having to keep ears open for the Volition and getting back what I could when I could."
-TRAVIS-
Could also be more than one.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, that and maybe the vessel is not for Predathos.
It's for Ludinus?
-LAURA-
Hm, I don't know.
-TRAVIS-
I mean, it might not just be one person that's a vessel.
-LAURA-
It might be multiple vessels.
-MARISHA-
Multiple, yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Multiple vessels.
-LAURA-
His Horcrux or soul.
-TRAVIS-
Could be a sacrifice, could be a host, could be a, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Yeah.
-TRAVIS-
Could be a ton of stuff.
Dominox, the Malleus Factorum.
-LAURA-
Okay, okay.
-MARISHA-
Ludinus wanting to be like an Exaltant Ruidusborn.
That was interesting too.
-LAURA-
Ooh, look at your nails.
They're so cute.
-MARISHA-
Thanks!
-TRAVIS-
I mean, been playing so long, I can't remember which character knows what.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
I know!
-ASHLEY-
I know.
(laughter)
-MARISHA-
I know.
-LAURA-
We don't know about Aeor? We don't know about Aeor?
-LIAM-
I don't know what that means.
-MATT-
No. All you know is--
-MARISHA-
Yeah, what do we know about Aeor?
-MATT-
Aeormaton, you know that's--
-MARISHA-
Right, we've heard it.
-MATT-
Yeah, you've heard about it.
You know it was an ancient society where FCG and FRIDA were both constructed.
-ASHLEY-
I remember some of that vision.
-MATT-
This kind of--
-MARISHA-
Oh!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-ASHLEY-
Oh, fucking FRIDA.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah, yeah.
-LIAM-
Oh, you're just now thinking that?
-TRAVIS-
You're just thinking about it now?
-MARISHA-
I thought about it, but it's been a week and I forgot!
-ASHLEY-
Yeah, yeah.
-MARISHA-
And now I'm remembering again.
-TALIESIN-
It's been nonstop in my head.
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Yeah, we have to tell FRIDA.
-MARISHA-
Oh, he's going to freak!
-LAURA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's not going to-- One awful moment at a time.
-TRAVIS-
By the way, we haven't had a moment to stop since we've been running.
Are you hungry, thirsty? Are you okay?
-MATT-
"Oh."
-TRAVIS-
It's been a sprint since we got you out of that--
-MATT-
"Yeah, I'm-- I don't know how long its been since I've eaten or had a drink.
I'm feeling real rough."
-TRAVIS-
I got some basic rations.
-MATT-
"If you got something for me I'm--"
-TRAVIS-
Yeah.
-LAURA-
Or I can make blueberries.
-LIAM-
He's 40 feet over there.
-TALIESIN-
Orym is far away.
-LAURA-
I thought maybe you came back just a little bit to hear everything down there.
-LIAM-
I listen.
I have a passive perception of 33. I've heard it all.
-LAURA-
Okay. (laughs)
-TRAVIS-
He's clocking it.
-LAURA-
Okay, just making sure you knew what was going on.
-MATT-
She immediately begins to devour whatever you hand her.
-MARISHA-
Just tell them all of it again.
-MATT-
And scarfing in a messily way.
The large hands grabbing and handing them to the smaller hands which are pushing them up into the face, and it's a four-armed feeding frenzy.
-LAURA-
We still have your--
-MARISHA-
Cytaa.
-LAURA-
Your cytaa.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-LAURA-
Aw.
-TRAVIS-
I'm going to start putting everything back in the bag of holding.
Can I take, with reverence, can I take the sword out of the sand and just look at it?
-MATT-
Yeah. It is a sleek saber-like weapon.
It has a very faint curve, the thickened blade itself having nearly no hilt, and where the hand wraps are you can see a tight leather cross wrap across it.
Where it fits the bottom of the pommel, there is a long set of leather wraps that swing as it goes and it moves.
There's a bit of a hook towards the back of it, and the blade itself has a very-- You don't even notice it at a distance, and you now realize the pain that it has.
There is a faint serration along the edge of the blade about halfway down that goes to the base of where the base of the hilt would be.
It is extremely light, and even just holding it there's a faint vibration to it with each swing.
-ASHLEY-
Wow.
-MATT-
This is Ishta, the Summit Blade.
-LAURA-
Ishta.
-MARISHA-
The Summit--
-LAURA-
Well, maybe we can absorb that shit.
-MARISHA-
Yeah.
-TALIESIN-
That's going to be permission.
-TRAVIS-
That is going to be.
-TALIESIN-
That's not our sword.
I am lying down on my back because everything fucking hurts and waiting for everyone to decide what the fuck we're going to do.
-LAURA-
Well, we have to get to the encampment.
Keyleth is waiting for us there.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-TRAVIS-
Do we want a short rest where we are? Should we push on?
-LAURA-
Let's push on.
-TALIESIN-
Short rest ain't going to fix anything.
-LAURA-
Yeah, let's push on to the encampment and then we'll be safe in Keyleth's bubble.
-MARISHA-
Mm.
-TALIESIN-
Mm.
-MATT-
Evoroa walks over to you as you're lying on the ground and extends an arm to help you up.
-TALIESIN-
(grunts painfully) Thanks.
-MARISHA-
Ashton, you all right?
-TALIESIN-
Say that again?
-MARISHA-
I know you're not all right.
-TALIESIN-
No. Are any of us?
-MARISHA-
Will you be?
-TALIESIN-
Will any of us? I think the answer to that is, yes and no.
There are particular moments, I have discovered, in a person's life where they have to decide what they're going to do next.
They often start this way, although at a smaller scale.
I think I need to sleep.
I think I need this headache to go away.
I think I need to break something, and then, you know, I think in the morning start having some thoughts about who we're going to be next.
(groans) You seem very lovely. I hope that you do great work.
You were very expensive.
I start slogging very slowly towards the direction we're going.
-LAURA-
I'm going to head towards Orym. Oh, sorry.
-MATT-
I was saying, yeah, as you walk away, she brightens up at the first thing you said and then darkens with a sad expression, taking in the connotation of it and "(sighs)" and continues to follow in pace with the rest of you.
-LAURA-
I'm going to heard toward Orym who's at a distance and approach slowly.
-LIAM-
Hey.
-LAURA-
Hi.
I'm going to put my hand on your shoulder.
-LIAM-
Sorry, I know how hard all that is for you.
-LAURA-
Don't apologize.
I can't begin to understand how hard it is for you.
-LIAM-
You know, every one of us makes our decisions with the lenses or prisms we see life through.
-LAURA-
Mm-hmm.
-LIAM-
I can't take mine down.
(sobs softly) It's not even about revenge for me.
(sniffles) I just try and honor what they sign up to do.
(sniffles) I just try and honor what they sign up to do.
-LAURA-
I didn't know them, but I can't imagine they wouldn't look at you and not be proud.
-LIAM-
(sighs sadly)
-LAURA-
I think you've gone farther than anyone could ever expect you to, and you're still going.
-LIAM-
(sighs softly) (sniffles) So far.
I'm going to miss him.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
Yeah.
-LIAM-
I'm going to miss Letters.
(sniffles)
-LAURA-
They were-- They were alive.
-LIAM-
Out of any of us, he just wanted to help.
-LAURA-
I want you to know that that for a while it may have felt that you and I were not seeing eye to eye or maybe you felt that I, I didn't have the same goal in mind that you did.
But don't worry about that anymore, all right? But don't worry about that anymore, all right?
-LIAM-
I understand family.
-LAURA-
Yeah.
Yeah.
-LIAM-
I want for all the world for you to have your family.
-LAURA-
I wanted that, too, and (chuckles) god, that back and forth is a pretty funny thing, but choices were made.
If nothing else, then at least we've got a little bit of knowledge on the inside now.
-LIAM-
Yeah.
As much we'd like to, you can't turn back the clock.
-LAURA-
That's right.
But you've got us.
-LIAM-
Going to squeeze your hand a little.
You mind if I take a minute?
-LAURA-
Take all the time you need.
We're heading to the encampment.
-LIAM-
I'll catch up.
-LAURA-
All right.
-LIAM-
Just stare out into the dark for a half a minute or so and I pull out the stone and I pull out the stone and reach out to Dorian.
We're home.
Can you hear me? I'm northeast of Bassuras.
I'm northeast of Bassuras.
Can you get there? I'm (voice cracking) struggling.
Sorry.
Can you get here? Fuck, I miss you.
-MATT-
As the words leave your lips and the spell sends them aloft, I'm going to ask you all to leave the table, please.
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-ASHLEY-
(exhales softly) (sniffles)
-MATT-
If you don't mind.
-TRAVIS-
To leave?
-MATT-
Yeah. To leave leave.
-TALIESIN-
Oh.
-MATT-
Leave.
Get out of the table.
-TRAVIS-
Okay.
-LAURA-
(gasps) Okay, fine!
-MARISHA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
If you don't mind.
-MARISHA-
Oh, whiplash!
-ASHLEY-
Fuck.
-LIAM-
Let's go find that hot dog costume.
(laughter)
-LAURA-
I want a hot dog real bad.
-MARISHA-
Real bad.
Oh shit!
-LIAM-
Fucking Aeor.
-ASHLEY-
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
-MATT-
(chuckles) (rubs hands) (inhales and exhales portentously)
-AABRIA-
You know what? I think I'll take it from here.
I think it's time to see the other half of the story, and we'll do that after the break.
See you soon.

Lark's arm reaches out of the dark doorway behind it and pulls Phineas through.

-ANNOUNCER-
We now go live to a special address from the President.
-GALE-
Hey, dweebs.
Now as your president, I've been kind of killing it lately.
I gave global warming an atomic wedgie.
I balanced the budget by selling my Pog collection, and I saved the Queen of England from that octopus! But my kick-assery is far from done.
According to this chart that I made, an estimated 35% of you are still a bunch of nasty goobers, but don't worry, I have a plan.
Operation: Gag Me With A Spoon.
It's easy sleazy.
According to this study that I wrote, if every citizen subscribed to Critical Role on Twitch, we could reduce maximum goobage by a metric buttload.
Twitch is the only place where you'll get a live and moderated chat.
And! If you subscribe to Critical Role, you instantly get access to all their shows as soon as the live broadcast ends.
So while you're oogling those Critical Role dorks with their sick goof-'em-ups and their nutty voices, think of me, Gale, the current president of (blows raspberry) whatever.
Now, I got to go make a fresh batch of spitballs, but I guess I have some time for your boring questions.
You.
REPORTER 1: Gale, is it true that if you subscribe to Critical Role through Prime Gaming, you have to resubscribe every month?
Uh, yeah.
I do it right after my monthly prank call to Pee-on O'Brien.
Next question.
REPORTER 2: Does Critical Role have exclusive emotes for their subscribers?
-ASHLEY-
Uh, doy.
Of course they do.
I like the "Hello, bees!" one because bees are cool.
I replaced my whole security detail with a bunch of bees that think I'm their queen.
Last question! REPORTER 3: Yeah, with all due respect, is Operation: Gag Me With a Spoon a real policy, or are you mad goofin'? (record scratch)
(scoffs) Am I mad goofin'? What, do you see me scarfing Milk Duds while doodling ding-dongs in the SkyMall catalog? Listen, I know I'm new to this.
And I admit that when I made the wish to be the boss of everything, I did not know the witch that works at Woolworth's was listening.
Well, Faustian bargain or not, I am the president now, and I have an obligation to lead this country.
So to answer your question: No, I am not mad goofin'.
Security, take him out! (bees buzzing) REPORTER 3: (panicked yells)
-GALE-
(cackles) (blows raspberry) Later, chudruckers! (large explosion) (fireworks exploding)
-AABRIA-
Vibes.
We're here, we're back in a different time slot.
This is nice.
So, my lovely Crown Keepers. Kymal.
After the events of our interlude those long, long weeks ago, you all moved north past the Silvercut Crossroads to lay low in the Wildwood Valley.
The settlements you dared stay at for more than a few days are more village than town, but the narrow edge of your escape from Poska and the Nameless Ones has you cagey.
What's the true distance of her reach? How far would your sister go to find you? And what do you think, Fy'ra Rai, she would do if she found you again? It's been almost a month of low living.
The six of you, Cyrus included, have a small cache of brumestone that you all harvested from your slow moving getaway platform.
(laughter)
Yeah, honestly, the first three weeks was you just slowly drifting.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
Can I use my staff to move this thing faster? Can I row? Can I row?
-ERICA-
Paddle with our hands.
-AABRIA-
Cyrus has been doggy paddling for weeks.
-MATT-
Yeah, we've both been back there.
-MATT-
That checks out.
-AIMEE-
Two little bimbos (blows air).
-AABRIA-
Two little bimbos just blowing in the breeze.
Yeah, you guys were able to harvest the brumestone from your platform.
You have it secreted across the six of you, so in the event that you have to scatter, you all have access to an incredible amount of money.
Were you able to find a place to fence it? You are not too far from Kraghammer, Westruun is a little farther away, but those are big hubs.
Poska's reach might get there.
The Myriad, the Clasp, the people that were pushed out in Kymal.
You are some of the few survivors of whatever went down there, and a big city isn't safe.
But two weeks ago, something new began.
Whispers reached even your remote ears.
A solstice, the Moon of Ill Omen, the Blightstar lost from the skies of Tal'Dorei trapped over Marquet.
Disenchantment of old and powerful magics.
No sending, no teleportation, no resurrection.
Those of you with connections to the gods of this world, the Wildmother, the Spider Queen, the Matron of Ravens, and even the Observer.
You have felt a pressing on the threads of your connections with them, from the Prime and Betrayer Gods, your first inkling of fear, and even from the Observer a new bit of interest, curiosity about the goings on in this world.
And then, a message from Orym, desperate, so sad.
Halfway around the world, he bade you find the Tempest in a tone that pushed your group from hiding to haste.
in a tone that pushed your group from hiding to haste.
So you find yourselves on the road once more headed south, then east towards the Summit Peaks and Zephrah.
You walk.
This time has been dark and difficult for you all not just because you have had to settle for living and hiding no longer around the glitz and glamour of Kymal, the standard of living that you were all accompanied to.
Even Cyrus has been showing signs of getting a little antsy, a curiosity, a need to move in a new direction.
Then, again, Opal's been getting pretty dark lately.
As you travel, I want to know just from the group, what's on your mind? What are you doing? What is your plan? Is it just to find your way to the Tempest to assist Dorian once more in his quest, or are you looking for something different, something new, somewhere new to go, or a sign to maybe splinter off and head in your own direction for new adventures?
-MATT-
See, Dariax has no drive or goal outside of the people that he's attached himself to.
A sense of kinship with those that he's traveled with and have been kind in his ramblings and stumblings, but also a renewed sense of protectiveness over Opal in these recent weeks.
A concern means he's liable to stay at Dorian's side, to follow in his footsteps even further, but also not far from Opal to make sure he shows where to put her footsteps.
-AABRIA-
Protector.
-ERICA-
I think Morrighan could best be described as a dog, a dog on a leash or a horse chomping at the bit.
She has been given so much new purpose in giving herself to the Matron of Ravens as her champion.
She doesn't feel that she deserves it, but she loves this new sense of purpose that she has because that's all she ever wanted.
The second that she left Kymal with these new comrades, I think she thought that everything was going to align for her and then she found herself more lost than ever, and sometimes changing location doesn't solve all of your problems.
And she feels distant because the people that she's with have a bond that is different than what she has and she has a new allegiance to the Matron.
The second that she says bite, she'll bite; it doesn't matter who it is.
-AABRIA-
Lying in wait.
-ANJALI-
I think after the discovery of the situation and change of heart, or so Fy'ra thinks a change of heart from her sister, she too has been, not lost and not fully demoralized, but just confused as to where she is most needed now.
She does remember once telling Dorian that, "Not all family is blood, much family is chosen," and so she's doing her best to divert her protective nature even more to these people who she was sent, pulled by the Wildmother to protect.
She's still feeling that loss of that one person that she was so connected to who now apparently doesn't just hate her, but wants to kill her.
-AABRIA-
Conflicted.
-ROBBIE-
I think over the past few weeks, this should be the scenario for Dorian that he thought he wanted: freedom, adventure.
It's not so much the situation that's dragging his mood down these days because he's glad to be surrounded by his friends and he's glad to have friends truly for the first time ever.
But as he's had more time alone and as he feels the group start to drift, he's starting to come to a realization that's unsettling for him and that he's missing something in this equation that he thought would lead him to the right answer and its purpose; and I think it's something he ran from months ago, something he felt like he didn't have and wanted and wanted to just forget about.
As he looks around at these people that he's grown to love and growing to love and being with, he's starting to wonder why he's here for the first time ever.
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
From drifting to searching.
-DORIAN-
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-AIMEE-
I think Opal is in a strange, almost dreamlike existence where I think she's losing the thread a little bit.
I think there are moments of clarity, and when there are those moments, she works overtime to be more herself around her family because to be more herself around her family because she feels like if she can keep it together in that way then she has some sort of control over it.
But I think, much like when you're in that space, that space between falling asleep and being awake, it's all very confusing.
In the moments where it feels a little more dreamlike, I think you may catch her with a far away look on her face or maybe murmuring to herself.
It's very concerning to her, but she's not wanting to alarm anyone yet.
(laughter)
-DORIAN-
What was that? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Opal, I like that you said dreams because I think your dreams were the thing that went first.
It is not that you go to sleep and have nightmares, but I think in your youth you would go to sleep and dream or have a nightmare and have some memory of it upon waking, even if it slips away across the day.
But every night now, for two weeks, you go to sleep and you wake up exhausted as though your body has been tense, moving.
Recovery is difficult and whatever happens from when you close your eyes and give yourself over to sleep and waking is a void and lost.
Anytime you reach within yourself towards Ted, towards whatever that connection is for clarity or understanding, the first thing you notice is that every dawn, if you reach for Ted, she is exhausted.
If you ask her, if you press, she tells you little and less.
She doesn't want to worry you. It's not your fight.
And that's the important thing.
You know there is a fight happening and you have no recollection of it.
Two weeks, and now you're on the road again, traveling long days down the road, exhausted.
It is at some point, just a few days into your journey towards Zephrah, towards purpose or adventure or whatever comes next after your last big quest, you feel it.
Something inside you breaks.
Too tired. Too much holding it together.
Your mind is yours and Ted's and hers, and she has been whispering to you.
You feel that fear, that concern oppressing, a hastening, and it all becomes too much.
You all walk down the road, and Opal stops.
Frozen, she's looking a thousand yards away in a direction as if she's listening, trying to hear, trying to understand, but she is stock still.
What do you all do?
-MATT-
Hey, Opal, you feeling all right there?
-AIMEE-
Can I hear him?
-AABRIA-
Give me a wisdom save.
-AIMEE-
Save?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm, like the difficulty 16.
-AIMEE-
Oh! 16.
-AABRIA-
It is like someone is shouting at you while running backwards.
You hear him closely at first, but it seems to be drifting off and away.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You can respond.
-AIMEE-
Did you say something?
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah, you're just, you know, look how you're getting one of those distant moments again.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-MATT-
Last time.
Just want to make sure you're all right.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I think I'm-- yeah.
Did you guys hear anything?
-ERICA-
Huh? I grab my rapier and I look around and see what I can possibly perceive.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Make a perception check.
That was the strongest ask for a perception check I've ever had.
Please take inspiration because that was incredible.
-ERICA-
Perhaps what I perceive--
-AIMEE-
The plosives!
-AABRIA-
Make an investigation check!
-ERICA-
Thank you. Oh, I wish it was perception--
-AABRIA-
No, it's perception.
It's 100% perception.
-ERICA-
Ah, bless you. Thank you.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, oh, 15, oh.
20. Unnatural 20.
-AIMEE-
A very strange 20.
-ERICA-
A strange.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh!
-ANJALI-
Bizarre 20!
-ERICA-
Weird 20!
-AABRIA-
The spookiest 20!
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
We got to get these chuckles out now.
I'm so excited.
-ROBBIE-
What?
-ANJALI-
(concerned noise)
-AABRIA-
What do you think, what's the first thing that Morrighan would look for?
-ERICA-
Well, I'm still keeping Poska and the Nameless Ones in the back of my head, so I'm trying to figure out if maybe someone's around or afoot, like a person in the trees.
Where are we? Are we on just a dirt country road?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you guys are actually a little bit off of the main road.
You're walking through the wooded area just off to the side--
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- just in case, being extra cautious, extra safe.
-ERICA-
Yeah, I'm afraid for many reasons, and also because the balance of magic is so thrown off that I'm like anything could happen at any time.
I really-- Poska.
I don't know, a goblin.
I don't know.
Name your names.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
Joe.
-AABRIA-
That felt mean to me, specifically.
-ERICA-
Maybe your name isn't real.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
I will not give you my true name!
-ROBBIE-
Your choices are Poska and Goblin.
-AABRIA-
Poska, Goblin, end of list.
-ANJALI-
Could be it.
-AABRIA-
You do not hear the steps of people anywhere around you, but the second half of my question is what is the thing you are most afraid of hearing or noticing?
-ERICA-
I feel like I should know the answer to this.
-AABRIA-
That's okay.
If it's a vague dread.
-AIMEE-
An ennui, if you will.
-ERICA-
I don't know, something coming towards me that's too big for me to take on.
-AABRIA-
That's just enough wiggle room that I'm going to get right in there.
-ERICA-
Oh, sick.
-AABRIA-
Thanks so much.
-ERICA-
No problem, girlie.
(laughter)
No problem, bestie.
-AABRIA-
It would be so easy if the thing that you felt on the wind and around you was a monster.
A very big goblin.
A bunch of guys.
-ERCIA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
But what you feel is the pressure of-- I want to ask you: What did it feel like to Morrighan What did it feel like to Morrighan when she made her deal with the Matron of Ravens, when she committed herself to becoming a paladin?
-ERICA-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Of her cause.
-ERICA-
I mean, it's ineffable.
I mean, finally, for once, I have a direction.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
I have a home, and I've never really had one, a purpose.
It felt like pure light, even though the Matron of Ravens is most associated with death.
I don't even think the idea of something that-- Like, something coming at her that's too big for her to take on.
She wants to prove herself so badly, especially because she has all of this new kit, so to speak, whatever in gamespeak like.
She has so much to do and she spends all of her days training, trying to figure out how to get a grasp of what she's got.
There's an excitement and a fear there for her.
I think that's probably the combination of things that she felt when she made her pact.
-AABRIA-
Excitement and fear and a desire to prove yourself.
-ERICA-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Against something.
-ERICA-
That--
-AABRIA-
Against a world, against whatever the spiritual presence you feel and you felt when the Matron of Ravens you feel and you felt when the Matron of Ravens went from a being of crow and corvid omens went from a being of crow and corvid omens to something overwhelming, massive in front of you to something overwhelming, massive in front of you that chose you, that gave you direction and purpose.
You feel that overwhelming feeling again, but it is tinged with something deep in the pit of your stomach.
Something that you know that your mistress, it curdles her stomach, so it curdles yours.
-ERICA-
And whatever curdles the stomach of death incarnate, that's pretty scary.
-AABRIA-
You turn towards that feeling of gravity
You turn towards that feeling of gravity and you look at Opal, trying so hard to shake off whatever this is.
You see it in a flash, in a caw, a bird song before it hits, and Opal, it's not that she raises or levitates off the ground, but she seems to grow massive and then she explodes out in every direction.
I'm going to need my map now.
We're going to get started.
-ROBBIE-
What? (exclamations)
-AABRIA-
Bring my map!
Oh my god!
-ROBBIE-
Okay, sure!
-AABRIA-
Yeah! I'm sorry.
-AIMEE-
Am I dead?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you can go home now.
-AIMEE-
Okay, bye.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Actually, that's pretty funny.
I think what I want to happen now-- Hey, Matt?
-MATT-
Oh. Yeah?
-AABRIA-
Can you do me a favor?
-MATT-
Sure.
-AABRIA-
I think I'm going to need you to slide on over there for me.

You know what I mean?
-MATT-
Can I send you my reel?
-ERICA-
Yeah, you can, actually.
-MATT-
Thank you, yeah.
-ERICA-
Yeah, absolutely.
-AABRIA-
Immersion.
-ERICA-
I can already tell it's going to be--
-AABRIA-
It's time to change the energy in the club.
-ROBBIE-
Oh. Okay.
-ERICA-
Oh, no!
-AIMEE-
Oh, no. Oh, no.
-ROBBIE-
♪ (beatboxing) ♪
-AIMEE-
It's so cold over here.
-AABRIA-
We need a little ambiance.
-MATT-
This seems fine. This seems like it's going to work out.
-ANJALI-
Ooh, no! What's happening?
-ROBBIE-
Trying to get a view.
-AIMEE-
This is comedic lighting, right?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
Absolutely.
I can take this out of your way.
-MATT-
Oh, it's all good.
-ERICA-
It's going to be great.
-ROBBIE-
Oh boy.
-AABRIA-
There we go.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
(nervous vocalizing)
-AABRIA-
Oh, Opal.
-AIMEE-
Oh, no.
Yes?
-AABRIA-
You feel yourself splinter out and the parts of you, inside of you, shoot forth webs, tendrils, held together with points of iridescent, opalescent gemstones.
with points of iridescent, opalescent gemstones.
You've been getting pretty dark for a while now, and you hear her voice in your ear, "(laughs) So sorry.
I think I wanted us to have a little more time to do this organically, but your sister keeps getting in my way."
-AIMEE-
This isn't going to be good for your image.
We've been working so hard to rehabilitate.
-AABRIA-
"I don't care about my image.
I care about my life.
What I need more than a rehabilitation in public perception is a champion, a true champion."
-AIMEE-
What does that mean?
-AABRIA-
"It means, I need you to come with me and I need to sever the ties that keep you with them."
-AIMEE-
Why? What did they do?
-AABRIA-
"They tie you to this place.
They hold you back.
What I need is someone who works for me, who serves me.
You accepted my crown, and now the bill is due.
Opal, twice crowned, You will become my champion."
-AIMEE-
Wait, where's Ted?
-AABRIA-
"She's here, too."
-AIMEE-
Is she hurt?
-AABRIA-
"No.
I wouldn't hurt you." Opal, you feel inside yourself this conversation happening.
But on the outside, all of you see her raise into the air.
She lands on a platform, a set of ruins in a bit of forest that, suddenly in that burst of energy, all of the leaves are burned away and scattered.
You see bits of webbing, opalescent gemstones embedded across the ground.
Opal turns to you all.
Aimee, I need you, before anything else happens, to tell me, who's the biggest threat in the Crown Keepers?
-AIMEE-
Oh shit.
Probably-- What do you mean, threat? What do you mean? Like who can do the most damage?
-AABRIA-
What do <i>you</i> think I mean?
-AIMEE-
Aimee thinks this is not a question I want to answer.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Opal is probably the most scared of Fy'ra Rai.
-AABRIA-
I need you to make a series of attacks against Fy'ra Rai.
-AIMEE-
No. No! (laughter)
Oh no! (laughter)
Wait, before I do that, can I cast a ritual? Can I Telepathic Bond?
-AABRIA-
I will say, for the sake of your guys' walking through the woods, you would have ritually cast Rary's Telepathic Bond at the beginning of the day.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
So you are all connected in a telepathic group chat.
-ROBBIE-
Oh!
-MATT-
Gotcha.
-ANJALI-
Oh, cool. Dope.
-AABRIA-
But Opal isn't picking up.
True Opal isn't picking up just yet.
So what comes now simply comes.
-AIMEE-
Okay, so not of my own volition?
-AABRIA-
Nope!
-AIMEE-
Okay.
(sighs) Okay, I'm going to have to Hexblade's Curse her first.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
I'm sorry.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
I love you, baby.
I love you, baby.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
I know it ain't you.
-ROBBIE-
Pull no punches!
-AABRIA-
None.
-ANJALI-
I know it ain't you.
It's okay.
-AIMEE-
I'm so sorry.
-AABRIA-
Let me be so clear.
-ANJALI-
It's okay.
-AABRIA-
Aimee Carrero, love of my life.
If you pull a punch--
-AIMEE-
I'm not.
-AABRIA-
-- I will know.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
And I'll make it worse.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
(laughing) Oh!
-AIMEE-
So you don't want me to Charm her?
-ANJALI-
Woo! (laughter)
Okay!
-AABRIA-
So I need you to swing.
-MATT-
I love it.
-AIMEE-
Okay. All right, cool.
I'm going to be a big girl about this, and I'm going to--
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-AIMEE-
-- throw three beams of Eldritch Blast.
-AABRIA-
So first off, before you attack--
-ANJALI-
Wait, wait.
-AABRIA-
What does it feel like when you Hexblade Curse Fy'ra Rai? What does she feel? What does she see? What is the group suddenly made aware of?
-AIMEE-
Well, I think to Opal, it feels like when you need to throw up, but you really don't want to, in this case.
-ANJALI-
Aw!
-AIMEE-
It's that feeling of--
-MATT-
Relatable.
-AABRIA-
-- dread, like: Oh no! That: Please help me, someone hold my hair back!
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
It doesn't usually feel that way to her, but in this case, because she's a friend, it does.
But I think what she sees is whatever Mask of Many Faces, pretty Opal is dropped.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
It's a very quick look, dart of the eye, and her eyes are just black.
-ANJALI-
(exhales)
-AIMEE-
It probably feels like a hand around the throat, but it's pink.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
Pink hands feel so different.
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra Rai--
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You feel that grab around your throat, and you look to your friend, and you see Opal, a crown, and then a pink crown below it, eyes dripping black, a set of arms reaching out, a second set of arms reaching down.
Make your attacks.
-ANJALI-
Real quick, what does Hexblade's Curse do?
-AIMEE-
"Once per short rest, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet.
Curse for one minute, plus five to damage rolls.
Critical hit on 19 or 20 and I regain 18 hit points if you die." Which you won't.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Which you won't."
-ANJALI-
The night is young.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Okay.
♪ (thinking tune) ♪ I add a 10 to each.
So, does 21 hit?
-ANJALI-
It does.
-AIMEE-
Does 22 hit?
-ANJALI-
It does.
-AIMEE-
Does 13 hit?
-ANJALI-
It does not.
-AIMEE-
Okay, thank god.
(laughter)
Okay.
All right, so now I roll--
-AABRIA-
This is already the most fun I've ever had.
-ROBBIE-
Reluctant PvP.
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
She'll get into it.
Don't you worry.
-AIMEE-
All right, this isn't so bad.
Oh, sorry.
1d4. I rolled d10s.
My bad.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, two d10s.
What are you doing?
-AIMEE-
I don't know.
d4.
I got them.
This is my bad ones, too.
So this is my bad d4s.
-AABRIA-
Why are you rolling d4s?
-AIMEE-
Because it's d4! 1d10.
You're right.
-MATT-
Yeah.
It's all good. You got this.
-AIMEE-
I'm looking at the wrong thing!
-AABRIA-
Hey, Aimee, look at me.
-AIMEE-
I'm looking at my vicious whip!
-AABRIA-
Here's what's going to happen. You're going to roll 2d10s.
-AIMEE-
I got it.
-AABRIA-
For the two that hit, and you're going to add plus 10 to both of them.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
So, 20-- No, 11, and 20.
-AIMEE-
31.
-MATT-
Oof.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
31 damage.
-ANJALI-
Fantastic.
-AABRIA-
31 damage.
-ANJALI-
It's all right.
-AIMEE-
(nervous moan)
-AABRIA-
With that, you see your friend, you feel a hand around your throat, holding you in place.
You are a monk.
You move through the world, you bend around nature and keep yourself lithe and agile.
You are held in place by your friend, as two dark bolts of energy land center mass in your stomach and there is nothing but to take it.
You feel that sense of nausea get chased quickly by two gut punches.
Force damage, yes, but betrayal.
And I need all of you to roll initiative.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
Quick question.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, of course!
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
This was a surprise, so I wouldn't have a reaction.
-AABRIA-
No. No.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
This was my mean little--
-AIMEE-
I think once you feel it, you hear the telepathic, "No, I'm so sorry!"
-ERICA-
That means it doesn't count, right?
-AIMEE-
It doesn't count.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, that's what that is.
-AIMEE-
God, I'm sweating.
-ERICA-
I rolled a natural 20, but I don't think that helps.
-AIMEE-
My ass is sweating.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it does.
-ERICA-
Oh, it does?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, add your dex.
-ANJALI-
So 27.
Fuck yeah.
-ERICA-
27, baby.
Natty 20.
-MATT-
Nice.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
Anyone above 25?
-ERICA-
I went 27, yeah.
-AABRIA-
27 for Morrighan.
-MATT-
Woo-hoo.
-AABRIA-
All right. 25 to 20?
-ANJALI-
23.
-ROBBIE-
24.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ERICA-
Wow.
Okay, gamers.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) And Fy'ra Rai, 23.
19 to 15?
-ROBBIE-
Oh no!
-AIMEE-
Oh!
-ANJALI-
Buddy.
-ROBBIE-
That's right.
-AABRIA-
We're back, baby.
-AIMEE-
The Dariax curse of battle roll.
-AABRIA-
14 to 10?
-AIMEE-
No!
-AABRIA-
No! Hey, I'm just going to ask--
-MATT-
It's nine, baby.
-AABRIA-
Nine!
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Dariax with a nine.
Opal, how'd you do?
-MATT-
Boys are back in town, y'all.
-AIMEE-
What do you mean, how'd I do?
-AABRIA-
You have to roll an initiative, too.
-AIMEE-
Oh, I have to roll, too.
Okay.
-MATT-
You're in the fight.
-AABRIA-
Oh, you're--
-MATT-
You are the fight.
-AABRIA-
You're the fight.
-AIMEE-
Can I? I think she wants to just walk away at this point.
Two! Wait, no. Plus two is four.
-MATT-
Okay.
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Roll for Ted.
-AIMEE-
Oh, Teddy.
-MATT-
Oh.
-AIMEE-
Sweet love.
10.
-AABRIA-
10. Good to know.
Is your familiar out?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, that little bitch.
Hey, little spider.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me initiative for your spider.
-AIMEE-
Nine. No, sorry, seven. Seven.
-AABRIA-
Copy that.
All right, go off, Cyrus.
Sweet.
Morrighan?
-ERICA-
Yeah?
-AABRIA-
You are up first.
-ERICA-
Sick.
-AABRIA-
What you see around you is Opal.
You hear in your head after she attacks Fy'ra Rai, "No, I'm sorry." You see this strange battlefield, spiderwebs, glowing.
The ground seems to churn and you can hear with your big lagomore ears, skittering, far off and away in the woods.
What do you want to do?
-ERICA-
I'd like to attack, move and attack.
-AABRIA-
Attack what?
-ERICA-
Oh my god, I don't know. Do I recognize anything as a-- Is it all one big thing, or is it all these different things? Can I point out one thing that I could actually (pop)?
-AABRIA-
Right now--
-AIMEE-
Off the body?
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Right now, the only combatant you see is Opal.
-AIMEE-
(nervous laugh)
-ERICA-
All right.
-AABRIA-
Why don't you give me-- Just looking at the lay of the land, the strange new thing that has happened is this webbing and these weird gemstones on the field.
Why don't you give me perception or investigation, your call.
-ERICA-
Okay.
Damn, I rolled a 19.
24 for perception.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-ANJALI-
Mm-hmm.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Perception.
You see those shining bits, they are deeply magical.
They don't seem-- You're looking for something to hit, and these are not necessarily that.
They are something of Opal--
-ERICA-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
-- thrown everywhere around you.
-ERICA-
So, they're something of her.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ERICA-
So it's all one thing.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ERICA-
Great.
I am going to-- Is she 30 feet away from me, or do I need to move closer?
-AABRIA-
You are--
-ERICA-
I love that I'm all the way in the back.
-AABRIA-
Yeah. Would you have wanted to be closer?
-ERICA-
I would like to be within 30 feet of her, if that's cool and chill.
-AABRIA-
Sweet. We can say that you started over here.
-ERICA-
Okay, cool.
-AABRIA-
That's fine.
You guys are going to be clustered up.
That's not bad for me.
-ERICA-
Amazing.
-ANJALI-
(nervous noise)
-ERICA-
I would like to cast Haste on Opal.
-AABRIA-
On Opal?
-ROBBIE-
On Opal?
-ERICA-
Wait, what? Oh, a willing creature.
On myself.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I was like--
-ROBBIE-
What are you doing?
-ERICA-
I don't know why I said that.
-AABRIA-
Let me be so clear--
-ANJALI-
Don't give her Haste!
-ERICA-
I'm newly a paladin
-AABRIA-
Hey, look me in the eye.
-ANJALI-
Do you want her to kill me immediately?
-ERICA-
I am a child.
I am a child.
-AABRIA-
Erica, I will Venmo you $20 if you Haste Opal.
-ERICA-
I will not--
-ANJALI-
It's going to have to be more than that.
-AABRIA-
Right now, I will do it.
-MATT-
Respect.
-AABRIA-
$30.
-ERICA-
I made a little bit--
-AIMEE-
Give her a Celsius.
-ERICA-
-- of a mistake, run it back.
-MATT-
That's okay.
-AABRIA-
Boo! Yeah, of course.
-ERICA-
I actually don't to be within 30 feet of Opal.
-AABRIA-
You don't.
-ERICA-
I need to be within 30 feet of myself.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Which, one could say you always are.
-ERICA-
So I'm going to cast Haste on myself.
-MATT-
Awesome.
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
I'm really good at the mechanics of all of this.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Hey, sweetie, you're doing great.
-ERICA-
Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste on myself.
That's what I'm going to use my action for.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ERICA-
Then, as far as movement, oh wait, actually, one second.
I had a whole plan here, but--
-AABRIA-
No, it's okay.
-ERICA-
You know?
-AABRIA-
You went before stuff happened. (laughs)
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
Mm-hmm.
-ERICA-
Is there--
-AABRIA-
That's what you get for rolling, honestly, far too high.
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-ERICA-
Far too high.
-ANJALI-
I need to fix something.
-ERICA-
Oh, actually-- Ooh, okay, actually, this is what I would love to do.
Could I actually move within 10 feet of her? Is that an option?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you get in close and you can--
-ERICA-
Or is that my move action?
-AABRIA-
I'll have you make an acrobatics or athletics check, your call, to come up on to, to scramble up the platform to get within 10 feet.
-ERICA-
Great.
-AABRIA-
Totally good and easy to do.
-ERICA-
Okay, cool.
So I'll make an athletics check.
Oh my god, my acrobatics is ass now.
It was so good.
-ANJALI-
Aw.
-AABRIA-
It's okay, it could be athletics.
-AIMEE-
But she's a bunny.
-ERICA-
Oh my god, I rolled another 19.
What the heck?
-ANJALI-
Yeah, baby--
-AABRIA-
Let's go!
-ANJALI-
Let's go!
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Honestly, this is vindication--
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ERICA-
-- for last time.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god!
-ERICA-
I feel vindicated.
-ANJALI-
Fair.
-AABRIA-
Also, don't forget, you do have Bunny Hop, so--
-ERICA-
Oh yeah, wait.
-AABRIA-
In instances where you are--
-AIMEE-
Is that a special feat?
-ANJALI-
Bunny Hop?
-ERICA-
Rabbit Hop, yeah, I have Rabbit Hop.
-AIMEE-
Stop.
-ERICA-
A number of--
-AABRIA-
Sorry, it's Rabbit Hop.
I could've said it the cool way.
-ERICA-
I mean, I don't really need it right now, right? I got a 28.
-AABRIA-
No, just if you're like: Oh, I don't want to roll like ass.
-ERICA-
25.
-AABRIA-
You could also just big, big bounce.
-ERICA-
Sick.
-MATT-
That's the cool thing about being a bunny.
-ERICA-
26.
-AABRIA-
26.
-ERICA-
Yeah, to get up there.
Then I would like, for my bonus action, to--
-AABRIA-
I've missed minis.
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
They are actually so cute.
-AABRIA-
This is nice--
-ANJALI-
Ah, shit.
-AABRIA-
Put that here.
-ERICA-
Oh wait, I--
-AABRIA-
Look at these ladies.
-ERICA-
I lost what I was going to do, okay.
-AABRIA-
You stand by a weird dick of gemstones.
-ERICA-
I'm going to use my Vow of Enmity.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, whoa.
-ERICA-
I'm going to utter a vow of enmity against this creature that I can see, using my--
-AABRIA-
What creature, Opal?
-ERICA-
Opal, yeah.
Using my Channel Divinity.
It's all the same.
-MATT-
Why not?
-ERICA-
I mean, I could just yell at a jewel, but this is cooler, right? Right? Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Okay, this feels really aggressive, and I like it.
-AIMEE-
Yeah! (laughs)
-AABRIA-
I'm learning new and magical things about myself.
-AIMEE-
I'm going to Google it.
Vow of what?
-ERICA-
A Vow of Enmity, so I gain, I just gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for one minute, or until it drops to zero hit points, or falls unconscious.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
Someone--
-MATT-
Hexblade's Curse retorted with a Vow of Enmity.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
I love it.
-AIMEE-
Wait, can you repeat that one more time.
What do I do?
-ERICA-
All I do is gain advantage on attack rolls--
-AIMEE-
Okay, okay. Got it.
-ERICA-
-- against you for one minute.
-AIMEE-
Got it.
-ERICA-
But I whisper to you, I say: Listen, we're going to get you out of this, okay? I don't know if you can hear me, but we're going to get you out of this.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I can hear you.
Just try not to kill me in the process.
-ERICA-
No, no, no, I'm just going to knock you out a little.
-AIMEE-
Okay, great.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
I want to be so clear that that is a telepathic bond.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah.
-ERICA-
Sick.
-AABRIA-
What you are looking at is a stone cold Opal with no visible sclera--
-ERICA-
Mm-hmm, yeah.
-AABRIA-
-- iris, pupil.
Just turns to you--
-AIMEE-
None.
-AABRIA-
-- the moment that vow hits.
"(joyless smirk)"
-AIMEE-
Eek!
-AABRIA-
That's all you get.
-ROBBIE-
(buzzes lips)
-AABRIA-
All right.
Anything else?
-ERICA-
I don't think I can--
-AABRIA-
You're hasted, so you have 47 things you can do, I think.
-ERICA-
Oh my god, okay.
-AABRIA-
It's the scariest spell ever.
-MATT-
You have one more action right?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Do I get to do it on--
-AABRIA-
You have 37 actions.
-ERICA-
-- when I cast Haste?
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
That's cool.
-AABRIA-
96 bonus actions, and 400 feet of movement, delightful.
-ERICA-
Oh my god, wait, where does it explain what my hasted action is? I don't think I ever actually saw--
-MATT-
A hasted action is generally an attack--
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
-- or anything else that's an action. You can't cast another spell, necessarily, but you can be a dodge, or it can be--
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
-MATT-
-- other standard actions.
-AIMEE-
Warlocks need that.
-ERICA-
Oh my gosh, okay.
-AIMEE-
Why don't I have Haste?
-AABRIA-
She almost cast it on you.
I tried to give her money about it.
(laughter)
-ERICA-
That was a massive mistake on my part, honestly.
-AABRIA-
Look--
-ROBBIE-
No take-back-sies!
-AABRIA-
You throw in 30, that's $60.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Yeah! (laughs)
-AABRIA-
If you cast Haste on her.
-ERICA-
Listen, fully a skill issue on my part.
I don't admit that lightly.
-AABRIA-
No, no, no, no, you're good.
-MATT-
No, it's all good, it's all good.
-AABRIA-
No, no, no.
You're perfect.
-ERICA-
But I guess for my hasted action, which again, I don't know where that is here, but thank you for letting me know, I tried to find it.
-MATT-
It's all good.
-AABRIA-
It's all good.
-ERICA-
I'm going to take my crystal rapier, and I'm going to go for an attack.
-MATT-
Yeah!
-AABRIA-
Great.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
I'm going to roll to hit.
Oh, and I have advantage, huh?
-MATT-
Yeah, you do.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ANJALI-
You sure do.
-AABRIA-
(whimpers)
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
I'm squishy.
-ERICA-
That's a 17.
(laughs) Okay.
-ANJALI-
Plus your stuff.
-ERICA-
18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
-MATT-
Roll again to see if it's a crit.
-ERICA-
24.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
No.
-MATT-
Okay.
-ERICA-
So, 24 to hit.
-AIMEE-
(sighs) Matthew Mercer.
-MATT-
I'm just saying.
You have advantage! (laughter)
-ANJALI-
We need you on this.
Thank you. (laughs)
-ERICA-
Does that hit?
-AABRIA-
It hits.
-ERICA-
Okay, sweet.
-MATT-
I'm on everyone's side.
-ERICA-
All right.
-ANJALI-
Fair.
-AABRIA-
You're good.
-MATT-
I'm Dariax, I don't know what's going on.
-ANJALI-
You are Dariax, you're like like, eh--
-ERICA-
What a nice guy, what a nice guy.
1d8 plus two, that's a three.
Then I get Improved Divine Smite, so I'm going to roll another d8.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ERICA-
Passively, I get another, and so, it's a four.
Then I am going to--
-ANJALI-
Four's enough?
-ERICA-
I'm going to use Divine Smite at 4th-level.
Is she a fiend?
-MATT-
Going out big.
-AABRIA-
She is not.
-ERICA-
No? Whoa.
-AABRIA-
That's your friend, Opal.
-ERICA-
Well--
-AABRIA-
She's just a little guy.
-ERICA-
She's just a little-- Oh, she's just a little guy? Okay, all right.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
Whatever you say--
-AABRIA-
All she did was go, "I'm going to choke my friend a little bit and make jewels on the ground," and then you decided to murder her.
-MATT-
I've been at that party.
-ERICA-
I don't know, I'm just feeling bad feelings about all this, so I would--
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
-- much prefer to have her unconscious so we could deal with this in a more--
-AABRIA-
For sure.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Civilized manner.
-AABRIA-
You can certainly try.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
In a more civilized manner.
So I'm casting it at 4th, so I think that gives me 5d8.
-AIMEE-
(shudders)
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ERICA-
So, I'm going to do 5d8 more damage.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
What are we at?
-ERICA-
That's a one.
-ANJALI-
That was nine originally.
-AABRIA-
We'll find out at the end.
-ERICA-
That's an eight.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ERICA-
That's a one.
-ANJALI-
10.
-ERICA-
That's a three.
-ANJALI-
Three, 13, and nine--
-ERICA-
Wait.
Five, right? One more?
-AABRIA-
Five, eight, yeah.
-ERICA-
Yeah, one more.
-AABRIA-
One more.
-AIMEE-
Eh, one more.
-ERICA-
That's a five.
-AABRIA-
Total of--
-ANJALI-
18 plus the nine from before.
-AABRIA-
Yep, so we're at 27.
-ROBBIE-
(exhales)
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
27 points of damage--
-ROBBIE-
(taken aback)
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
-- that you put into your friend.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
(whimpers)
-AABRIA-
What does it look like as you attack her with your crystal rapier?
-AIMEE-
Murder, it's murder, that's what it is.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
I don't think that I do it with pleasure.
I think it's a very, I walk up to her, and I sink that rapier into, I can't even do her stomach, I have to do her thigh.
I just rip it down her thigh.
-AIMEE-
Ouchies.
-ANJALI-
(sharp inhale)
-ERICA-
I'm going: I'm sorry, I think this is what I need to do. I'm sorry.
-AABRIA-
Opal.
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
You take none of that damage.
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You feel the dagger sink into her thigh, and that second set of arms grabs the blade at the bottom and pushes forward, and pushes out.
What walks in front of Opal-- Where are my little minis? Where's my little guy? I don't think you've had the pleasure of meeting Ted.
-AIMEE-
(gasps)
-ALL-
Oh!
-AABRIA-
Your blade is sunk into the dark shadow of something that looks like Opal, but where Opal is all thin, smooth lines, and litheness, this is like if Opal did CrossFit for three years--
-ERICA-
Oh my god, no!
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
-- and was pure raw red meat diet.
-AIMEE-
Oh my gosh!
-AABRIA-
This is meat beast Bandersnatch Opal that is holding the blade--
-AABRIA-
-- in her thigh, and walks forward.
-ERICA-
Ted took no damage?
-AABRIA-
Ted is going to take all of that damage.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Opal takes none.
-AIMEE-
I mean, she--
-AABRIA-
But you have effectively separated Opal and the other half of her soul.
-ANJALI-
(sighs)
-ERICA-
(shocked)
-AABRIA-
She looks at you, eyes as blank as Opal's are now, and pushes your sword back and out of her thigh, and reaches behind her, and pulls out a massive sword of her own.
-MATT-
Oh!
-ERICA-
I get another attack, right? Or do I not?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you have two.
Did you do both of your attacks in your--
-ERICA-
No, I did just did one.
-MATT-
No, just one.
-AABRIA-
Okay, yeah, attack again.
-ERICA-
All right.
In this moment, Morrighan's almost a little bit relieved, because there's something else to fight other than Opal, and I'm like: Okay, maybe she's got this proxy.
Do I have any blood on my hand, or was there no Opal blood on my hands? When I sunk that dagger in.
-AABRIA-
When you sunk that dagger in, Opal began to bleed, and then this shadow walked forward, and the shadow does not bleed.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
So what you have on you is a little bit of Opal's blood.
-ERICA-
Okay, got you.
-ANJALI-
Hmm.
-ERICA-
Okay, cool. Well, I'm going to go at Ted again, now I know it's Ted.
Fuck you, Ted.
I'm going to go at Ted with my crystal rapier again.
I have advantage, right?
-AABRIA-
You have advantage on Opal.
-ERICA-
Oh my-- Oh, just on-- Wait, I thought it was all-- Oh, that's so-- Oh.
-ROBBIE-
Dirty.
-AABRIA-
Hey, bud.
-ERICA-
Dirty.
Dirty, dirty.
That's a 15.
-AIMEE-
She's not even a real person.
-AABRIA-
As you go--
-ERICA-
22.
-ANJALI-
It's okay, baby.
-AABRIA-
Ted is going to scream across the bond.
"No, no, no! Stop!" That's going to be her verbal component for casting Shield, which is going to turn Ted's AC to 23.
-ROBBIE-
Whoa.
-ANJALI-
Oof.
-ERICA-
All right.
-AABRIA-
You hesitate for just long enough that her blade goes and deflects.
She stands, interposing in between the two of you.
Her mouth doesn't move, but you can hear Ted in your head across the bond.
"What are you doing? Why are you attacking her? (panting)"
-ERICA-
Do you think I'm an idiot? I know something bad is about to happen here.
-AABRIA-
"What? You could-- You could help the-- Why is the first thing you do drawing blood?"
-ERICA-
I don't know.
-AABRIA-
"I will protect her at any cost.
And if that means--" At this point, you all hear Ted's voice getting quiet.
Not you, as she stays in your head.
"If that means I have to slaughter you, you can be the first body to drop."
-AIMEE-
(gasps)
-AABRIA-
You hear the skittering of spiders.
-AIMEE-
Whoa!
-AABRIA-
Anything else you want to do? You still have 400 feet of movement.
-ERICA-
Oh. I'd like to--
-AIMEE-
For real?
-ERICA-
-- move away, please.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
You can go do anything else in the world.
You could go to a different campaign with the rest of your movement.
-ERICA-
I'd like to go to a Denny's.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
An Arby's, maybe.
-ANJALI-
Get a Grand Slam!
-AABRIA-
You find an Arby's.
You get a giant hot dog that looks like a pussy.
-ERICA-
Yeah. Yeah.
-AABRIA-
We haven't forgotten that.
We haven't forgotten.
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
I get a giant hot dog, I look at it, it's actually Marisha.
-AIMEE-
"Hot dog."
-AABRIA-
It's Marisha.
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-ERICA-
I get in my car.
-AABRIA-
"Hot dog."
-ERICA-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-MATT-
I'll never forget it.
-ANJALI-
No, no.
-AABRIA-
I'm so sorry.
(laughter)
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Scarred for life.
-ERICA-
I'd like to move away, please.
-AABRIA-
Sure.
-ERICA-
Where do I find this information about my hasted movement, or hasted action?
-MATT-
So, Haste---
-AABRIA-
You go.
-MATT-
It's just double movement.
So whatever your movement speed is--
-ERICA-
Oh, okay. Got you, got you.
-MATT-
-- you take double that.
-ERICA-
Okay, got you.
-AABRIA-
Don't forget, you've got a plus two to your AC while Haste is up.
-ERICA-
Oh, sick. Okay, cool.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
You're incredibly hard to hit.
Oh, and when you use, don't forget, when you use your hasted attack, you only get one attack, even if your paladin abilities would give you a second attack.
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
So.
-ERICA-
Wait. Okay, okay.
-MATT-
You can attack twice, and then you can use your hasted attack to do a third.
-AABRIA-
There you go.
So, you're good.
-ERICA-
Okay, cool.
-AABRIA-
You did it right.
-ERICA-
Cool. That's great.
-AABRIA-
You're perfect and above reproach.
-ERICA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Just so you know, you're at the edge of this platform.
If you move away more than five feet, Ted will get an attack of opportunity on you.
But you can just skirt around both of these problems.
-ERICA-
(trilling) Skirt!
-AABRIA-
Where do you want to be? Do you want to try to get behind? What are you trying to do?
-ERICA-
Probably back there maybe, back near that rock.
-AABRIA-
Back here?
-ERICA-
Or back there, no, farther back, please.
-AABRIA-
Right here? If you leave that threatened range, she's going to get an attack on you if you go.
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
Let me just, as far back as I can get without doing that thing you said.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You move over here--
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- to turn around.
It also gives your friends a clear view on what's going on.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You realize you are standing-- (laughs) Under your feet, you see an arrangement of those opalescent gems.
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
It's a little pattern of four.
No perception check, it just sort of kind of looks like a dick--
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
Cool, Cool, cool, cool.
-AABRIA-
-- under your feet.
-ERICA-
Wow, it's so big.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Stop it! (laughter)
-ANJALI-
There it is!
-ROBBIE-
I knew it.
-ANJALI-
There it is.
-ROBBIE-
I knew it.
-AABRIA-
Inspiration!
-ANJALI-
Everybody drink!
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-ERICA-
I'm so distracted.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
There's an ash hole right next to it.
-AABRIA-
No!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah!
-AABRIA-
No!
-ANJALI-
Yes!
-ROBBIE-
Full circle.
-MATT-
Bring it back.
-AABRIA-
As it gives under your foot, your feet are cracking across this, and you're, "Oh, there's something to it," you feel, you feel something magical as your feet skirt across it, like if you put more pressure on it, you can break them.
But they are something to be interacted with, and are magical.
You're just a pure paladin, you just get that for free.
-ERICA-
Yeah, I'm pretty cool, I guess.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Hey, welcome back.
You rolling well is terrifying.
-ROBBIE-
Well.
-AABRIA-
I love that.
-ERICA-
(clicking)
-AABRIA-
I love that for me, I love that for all of us.
Next up is Dorian, Fy'ra Rai, you're on deck.
-ROBBIE-
Oh snap.
-ANJALI-
You're on deck.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I got, so, I got to take this back in time a second, right?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-ROBBIE-
24 seconds ago, we were strolling through the forest, right?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, cool, and so--
-AABRIA-
It was so gooshy.
-ROBBIE-
Dorian was up front, tooting a little tune on his flute, okay in his own zone.
Then, in that amount of time, Opal levitated, burst forth spiderwebs and gems, shot a bolt, and nearly killed one of our friends.
-AABRIA-
Several.
-ROBBIE-
But Morrighan immediately stabbed her in the leg, a demon person burst forth in the last half a minute or so.
-AABRIA-
Not even half a minute.
-ROBBIE-
Not even.
-AABRIA-
Not even.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, so--
-AABRIA-
It really popped off.
-ROBBIE-
So-- (laughs) (laughter)
-ANJALI-
Ah!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah,
-ROBBIE-
Processing, Dorian just is ♪ (flute note) ♪ this last little toot, and all of a sudden--
-AABRIA-
No!
-ANJALI-
Double toot?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
You were tooting the toot?
-ROBBIE-
You see his winged boots engage.
-AABRIA-
Yeah?
-ROBBIE-
He starts to look up at everything that just transpired.
As he flutters past Fy'ra Rai, and still got his flute, then he goes: Better get your head in the game, Bossy Genasi.
Tootley-toot! And gives a bardic inspiration.
-ALL-
Oh!
-ROBBIE-
He's been working--
-ANJALI-
Is that a d10? Fuck yeah.
-ROBBIE-
He's been working on his nicknames.
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
He's going to use his movement to fly underneath that ridge, trying to stay out of sight a little bit.
-AABRIA-
Okay. This way?
-ROBBIE-
Doo-doo-doo-doo.
Yeah, sneak past the ooey gooey.
-AABRIA-
Ooey gooey, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
He has thoughts of, for a moment, of trying to engage, and goes: Eh.
-AABRIA-
Eh.
-ROBBIE-
I would like to try to get up to Opal, and grapple her.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
I think you got some movement for that.
-ROBBIE-
Just strength, I got 40 feet now.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're good.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
All right.
Grapple check.
-ROBBIE-
(sighs)
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me an athletics check.
Strength save.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
Oof.
-ROBBIE-
Okay, athletics.
-AIMEE-
Oh, that's a natural 20.
(gasping)
However, I have a minus one in strength.
That is a 19.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
This is a--! Uh-oh.
That is a four.
(laughter)
Plus 13, so, it's--
-AABRIA-
Is it really plus 13?
-ROBBIE-
My athletics is plus 13.
-ERICA-
Whoa.
-AABRIA-
Scary.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
That almost did it, and that's hilarious.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
But it didn't.
-ROBBIE-
So I'm going to fly up to her, and he's like: Are you okay? And--
-AIMEE-
No!
-ROBBIE-
-- try to give her a big hug.
-AABRIA-
What do you do?
-AIMEE-
What can I do?
-AABRIA-
Well, you rolled higher, so you can tell me how you avoid being grappled.
-AIMEE-
I, okay, so in the telepathic, what?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Telepathic bond, I say: Oh, that's a nice hug, you've never hugged me before, But in person--
-AABRIA-
Pff! (laughter)
-AIMEE-
In person--
-AABRIA-
Ah!
-AIMEE-
You literally, I guess one of my arms goes--
-ROBBIE-
(gasps)
-ANJALI-
Oof.
-AABRIA-
Ooh!
-AIMEE-
Just dead face, just picks him up.
I'm assuming that arm is strong, I don't fucking know, and it goes like that.
-AABRIA-
I like it.
-AIMEE-
If it's not strong enough--
-AABRIA-
The fact that you're levitating means you're very light, you're just, mm, okay.
-AIMEE-
(laughs) Okay, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Doink, okay.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
I'm going to lose a nail.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Ah!
(groans)
-ROBBIE-
Dorian has completely (laughs) disappointed himself that that didn't work.
He's just in that bush behind where I got dropped off, and just goes: Oh.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
That's it, that's all I can do.
-AABRIA-
That's it?
-ROBBIE-
That's bonus action, action, movement, so--
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
-ROBBIE-
-- that completes my turn.
-AABRIA-
While you're here, give me, I love the idea of failing forward, so you don't manage to grapple her, but you get in close and you're like incredibly tight with whatever magic fuckery is happening with Opal right now.
You can hear in your mind the difference between what she is thinking and saying to you versus her actions.
So I want you to tell me a roll you think Dorian would make to try to figure out what's going on.
-ROBBIE-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Give you a little intel.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, not his top tier.
-AABRIA-
Are you not curious? If you're not fundamentally curious, we can move on. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I am very curious about what's happening right now--
-AABRIA-
Yeah?
-ROBBIE-
-- but (sighs) I got nothing good.
-AABRIA-
Arcana, investigation, perception, insight.
-AIMEE-
It's for you.
-ROBBIE-
All doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.
-AIMEE-
It's for you.
-ROBBIE-
I mean, what I would do is try to convince her to tell me something, persuasion, maybe.
But is that too active?
-AABRIA-
Go ahead, no, no, I like that.
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Make a persuasion check to try to keep Opal, not the thing acting, but the person inside, talking.
-ROBBIE-
We can talk mentally?
-AABRIA-
Yes, you can.
-ROBBIE-
Hey, buddy.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
You want to tell me what's going on? Oh my fucking god.
Nat one, plus 13, 14.
(groaning)
You want to tell me what's--
-AIMEE-
It's not nothing.
-ROBBIE-
It's still 14, it's high.
-MATT-
It's still a nat one. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
You want to tell me what's going on?
-AABRIA-
Here's the thing, that's still a nat one.
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
So Aimee--
-AIMEE-
Yeah?
-AABRIA-
-- love of my life--
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm?
-AABRIA-
I would love if you would respond less as Opal who is confused--
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AABRIA-
-- and more as the Opal that is acting right now, as that part of you leans in a little bit and addresses Dorian.
-AIMEE-
I think she says, "She doesn't know."
-ROBBIE-
Who's she? You're she.
-AIMEE-
Am I?
-ROBBIE-
Are you? (laughs)
-AIMEE-
Are <i>you</i>? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
(claps)
-ERICA-
I love it.
-MATT-
Dariax's nose bleeds just a little bit.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (laughter)
So does the Spider Queen, who's like, "What is happening?" (laughter)
-ERICA-
His one brain cell is working so hard.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Incredible. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Ah, boy.
-AABRIA-
Fy'ra Rai, you are up.
-ROBBIE-
That's rough.
-ANJALI-
Okay, question, this choking business, am I grappled, or that was just damage?
-AABRIA-
No, no, no.
It's just the feeling of whatever Opal's magic is feels like a hand around your throat.
It's for vibes.
-ANJALI-
Word.
Okay, cool.
-AABRIA-
It does not mechanically affect you.
-ANJALI-
(sighs) Lots of stuff going through my brain.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, how you doing? (buzzes)
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Okay, so I just had one sister---
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Aw!
-AABRIA-
(claps)
-ANJALI-
-- who decided that she wanted to try to kill me, somewhere between the time when I thought she was dead and discovered she was alive.
But I've seen this happening with Opal over time, and I think I can shake off the-- So much of me is feeling, again, double betrayed, but I know it's not her, I just know.
Over the last few weeks, I think I've been asking the Wildmother, I've been asking for the sight to give me some kind of insight as to what is going on and what is going on specifically with Opal.
So before I do anything, can I go back to those two weeks and do a little check in?
-AIMEE-
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
Absolutely.
-AIMEE-
Cool.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and give me, what do I want to call that? Let's make it either religion or insight.
-ANJALI-
(laughs) Yeah, we'll do insight.
-AABRIA-
Okay, no one wants a religion check.
-ANJALI-
That was cocked.
-AABRIA-
Well, you're going to go talk to the gods, but you don't want to use int?
-ANJALI-
25.
-AABRIA-
Well, shit.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
It's always been insight for the Wildmother.
-AABRIA-
Of course.
-ANJALI-
I'll take it.
-AABRIA-
Insight is a slightly different understanding of this.
You are looking at the heart of your friend and not necessarily the interaction between the god whose purview she has committed to.
-ANJALI-
Mm, okay.
[phone notification ding]
-AABRIA-
Shush.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
Apparently, that was the Wildmother telling you to give me a message.
What did she say? (laughter)
-AIMEE-
What did she say?
-AABRIA-
She said, "Google password required." (laughter)
-ANJALI-
Aw.
It's 1234.
-AIMEE-
Fy'ra Rai would have "1234."
-AABRIA-
We'll do this as a series of questions.
I can either offer you generic knowledge, that's a very high roll.
You can be specific and I'll give you specific answers.
Oh, it's so fun talking GM to GM now.
-ANJALI-
Is there--
-MATT-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
Hey-oh!
-ANJALI-
Oh, no, oh. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
I thought you were talking to him.
-MATT-
No, you.
-ANJALI-
It's me!
-AABRIA-
It's you!
-AIMEE-
Hey!
-AABRIA-
It's you, girl.
-ANJALI-
I did a thing.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-AIMEE-
(claps)
-ANJALI-
Is there anything that I can do to peel her away from whatever is happening? Is there anything you can help me do to peel her away from what is happening? You, Wildmother?
-AABRIA-
Those are two very specific questions.
The Wildmother, who strangely enough, at first, you got signs from her, and then in your time traveling with the Crown Keepers, you had full verbal communication.
But it seems as though she has stepped back again, and speaks in sign and feeling.
Your first question, what can you do to peel away? You feel a little bit of hesitation.
Remove the crown.
You have a sense of stinging and burning briars or nettles in your scalp at your hairline ripped away.
The second question, what could she, the Wildmother, do, is met like a sudden gust of wind blocking your path.
is met like a sudden gust of wind blocking your path.
Why would she? Why would she stop what's happening?
-ANJALI-
Well, that's unexpected.
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
I'll give you one more question, if you want to follow either of those leads.
You can find out more about the Wildmother's resistance or you can find out more about the nature of Opal's interaction with the Spider Queen.
-ANJALI-
I know this isn't Opal.
What do you need from me to help her?
-AABRIA-
"What do you need from me to help her?" A specific set of questions, you feel the nature of the Wildmother's answer, like if you stood in a field of kudzu as it rapidly grows around your ankles, binding you.
A twist of words, "What could I do to help you help her?" Again, you get that sense of briars and prickling stinging things across those vines.
"Why would I stop this from happening?" Not out of fury, but again out of fear.
Then, once more, you feel at your temple the crown, Then, once more, you feel at your temple the crown, and a flash of blinding pain, to let you know the cost of separating Opal from the crown she donned willingly.
You flash back to here and now.
Fy'ra Rai, what do you do?
-ANJALI-
All right.
-AIMEE-
(nervous noise)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
I look at Opal, and I say with a telepathic bond, "I'm sorry." I say out loud, "You can't have her." I use my ki points to pull my hand back, and in my hand, you see appear a whip, but it's made of thick lava.
I swing it around to her actual body I swing it around to her actual body and not to Ted.
So around her.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
I attempt to lava whip her back to me.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Go ahead and make an attack roll, knowing that Ted is providing partial cover, so her--
-ANJALI-
Right, but it's a whip.
-AIMEE-
It's a whip.
-AABRIA-
It can go around, right?
-MATT-
It's a dex save on her part.
-ANJALI-
It's a dex save on her part.
Actually, you know what? I can move so that I have a straight line of sight of her.
-AABRIA-
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Do I come this way?
-ANJALI-
Maybe not that far.
Can I get closer to?
-AABRIA-
Where you trying be?
-ANJALI-
Halfway through, halfway between the two.
-AABRIA-
Here?
-ANJALI-
Yeah, but back closer to the, yeah, let me get there.
-MATT-
Ah.
-AIMEE-
Do I roll a dex save?
-ANJALI-
Dex save.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, there you go.
-AIMEE-
That is a 16.
-ANJALI-
Meets it, beats it.
Yeah, okay, so you take--
-AIMEE-
As a reaction--
-AABRIA-
There it is.
-AIMEE-
I'm going to use Armor of Hexes--
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
-- which is if a target of your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, this reaction--
-AABRIA-
She didn't hit.
-AIMEE-
Huh?
-AABRIA-
She didn't hit you.
-AIMEE-
She did hit me.
You said it hits me.
-ANJALI-
You made the save.
So it just says half damage.
-AIMEE-
But I made the save.
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Oh, is it going to be half damage?
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Oh, then yes, this all goes through, continue.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I can use my reaction to roll a d6.
On a four or higher, the attack misses.
It's a two.
-MATT-
Mm.
-ANJALI-
Okay, so it's 3d10 bludgeoning, but halved.
-AIMEE-
Oh, whew.
-ANJALI-
I have 94 dice and I can't think straight right now.
I can't think about which one is which.
Which one is which?
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) That's a lot of dice.
-ANJALI-
Seven.
Eight.
Eight and six, 14, so seven.
-MATT-
You have a stadium of dice that get to watch--
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
It's crazy.
-MATT-
-- and shame the other dice.
-ANJALI-
No, but I'm so confused.
-ROBBIE-
"I would've done it better."
-ANJALI-
They would.
-MATT-
It's a full jury.
-ANJALI-
You didn't do very well, so you're going in the penalty box.
-AIMEE-
That one's going.
The hefty ones do--
-AIMEE-
They cannot go in.
-ANJALI-
Penalty box.
-AIMEE-
Yes. Heavy ones go into the penalty box.
-ANJALI-
Okay, so it's seven damage, that's it.
-AIMEE-
Yep.
-ANJALI-
But.
So that is my action.
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ANJALI-
I am going to use my--
-AIMEE-
Heh. Oop.
-ROBBIE-
Sorry. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I've been dying to do it for an hour.
-AABRIA-
He's not even sorry.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
I'm going to use my movement, the rest of my movement.
Fuck, you guys, everything I thought I knew about the world is untrue.
I don't want to be grouped up like that.
-AABRIA-
No, it's probably fine.
-AIMEE-
(laughs) It's probably fine.
-AABRIA-
It's probably fine.
I'm so sorry, I rolled a little low.
-ANJALI-
Hang on.
-AABRIA-
We're about to beat their ass in a second, don't you worry. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
No.
-AIMEE-
No, no, no.
-AABRIA-
We're coming.
How you doing? How you holding up?
-AIMEE-
I'm cold.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
Cool, I--
-AABRIA-
You seem a little cold and lonely.
I'm going to get you a friend.
Continue.
-ANJALI-
I'm-- Aw.
I am going to use the--
-MATT-
What does that mean?
-ANJALI-
Sorry?
-MATT-
I said, "What does that mean?" Continue.
-ANJALI-
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.
I'm going to spend-- I'm going to move even further that way.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
How far you want to go? You move across another dick of gems.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
Does any information?
-AABRIA-
You feel dick under your feet?
-ANJALI-
Yes. (laughs)
-MATT-
If I had a nickel.
-AABRIA-
But do I have any sensation of what those things are or any--?
As you move across, you feel, you give it a little test, like, "What the shit is under my foot?" It feels crushable.
As you lean into it, it feels like-- You know what? Go ahead and give me, what do I want this to be? Give me an insight check.
27.
-AIMEE-
(laughs) Oh, oh shit.
-AABRIA-
The moment your heel brushes across the back of it, it feels like it brings a memory to mind.
-AIMEE-
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
All of a sudden, your mind snaps to a conversation you had with her forever ago.
to a conversation you had with her forever ago.
But you don't press and you're keeping your eye on her and trying to figure out what's going on.
So it's the beginning of your mind beginning to wander, and you snap and call it to attention as you cross over.
-ANJALI-
Then for my final thing, as a bonus action, I'm going to spend one ki point to take the dodge action, just in case some shit goes down, because some shit's gone down--
-AIMEE-
Preventative dodge?
-ANJALI-
-- and I was not prepared.
-AABRIA-
A preventative dodge.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, so I believe that's all I got.
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
Now I get to go.
-AIMEE-
Oh no. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Mm-hmm, but why?
-AIMEE-
But why?
-AABRIA-
The skittering gets much louder. (skitters)
-AIMEE-
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
-ERICA-
Ugh, ah.
-AIMEE-
It's like the Jumanji spiders.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
They are like those real fat-body Jumanji spiders.
-ROBBIE-
Don't get Jumanji-ed.
-AIMEE-
Thick! Thick.
-AABRIA-
One here.
-AIMEE-
Oh, you put the little gems on there.
That's cute!
-ROBBIE-
Is that the one redeeming quality, as long as they're cute, you're fine with it?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I knew it, I knew it.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, they're real cute, guys.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AIMEE-
Opal is me, I am her.
(laughter)
I am she.
(strains) Ooh, I don't even have a spider thing and those are gross.
-AABRIA-
And put one more back here.
-MATT-
Oh, just a bunch of them.
-AABRIA-
Just like a couple.
-ROBBIE-
There's a couple.
-AABRIA-
There's so many of you and just a couple of me.
-MATT-
No.
-ROBBIE-
They're fine.
-AABRIA-
They enter onto the field, as all of you hear inside the bond and inside the world around you, the laughter.
Those of you that have had time and interactions with the Spider Queen know her voice.
"(laughs) You won't stop me from making her mine without killing her.
So what are you all prepared to do? Because I will not die to that." And with that, "That," you all feel a flash of red behind your eyes.
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
-AABRIA-
The spider way back over here is going to move to a little stack of dicks.
-AIMEE-
Oh boy.
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Those gems.
And reaches down and scoops them up.
You all see they flash in the midday sun and crush them.
-AIMEE-
(gasps)
-AABRIA-
And Opal.
-AIMEE-
Aw.
-AABRIA-
-- you feel something go away forever.
You know it in the moment as you lose it.
-AIMEE-
Aw.
-AABRIA-
There's a part of your past, (sighs) you never really understood what your deal was with Ted.
Who she was to you was your sister, but why did she disappear? Why was she inside you? Why did all of the events that brought you to these people, how did they all come to pass? There's a story you remember now, but how could you remember a thing that your mother told you and Ted when you were three years old as she tucked you in, shortly before she disappeared from your home and from your life in Byroden? There's a word, Aevilux, a splinter group.
She tells a story, looking at you kindly with shining eyes, mismatched color.
A long time ago, a group of people found something called a beacon.
They learned from it some great entity or god, a concept that sought to know itself, to understand via experience in the world of Exandria, it split itself apart.
This one found far away.
These people that worshiped Luxon, that's the word, the Luxon, found, created magics within themselves to split their own souls apart so that they could learn who they were via observation.
-AIMEE-
Hmm, mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
As a child torn in two, you observe yourself, you learn who you are, what you like, what you want, what you need, your purpose, and then rejoin, find unity once more.
Your mother was one of these people.
-AIMEE-
Oh shit.
-AABRIA-
So, Ted, Opal, Georgina, are you.
So, Ted, Opal, Georgina, are you.
You and Ted found each other again, reunited to something stronger than your wholes.
You understand yourself because you understand Ted.
Ted wants to protect you because she is protecting herself.
-AIMEE-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
She's not lost to you, she is you.
-AIMEE-
Mm, mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
You are something rare and magical in the world of Exandria, and the memory of that is gone forever, in the moment of knowing it.
The other spiders skitter in, getting closer.
Let's see.
The rest of them are here.
They're going to close a little bit.
This one can get just a little closer.
The one beside Dariax is not going to be able to get in and fight yet.
They just appear on the field.
You see, all of you, as they arrive on the field, they look between you as combatants, and those gems on the ground and in the trees and in the webs, unsure of their targets, but deciding between both.
-ANJALI-
Do we see anything visibly happen to Opal as that is crushed or is that all internal?
-AABRIA-
I will allow for Opal to respond in the telepathic bond, if you want to.
-AIMEE-
Am I aware of having lost it?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
But I can't recall the memory?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-AIMEE-
So it's like--
-AABRIA-
It's like when you know you had a nightmare--
-AIMEE-
But you can't--
-AABRIA-
-- and then the moment you wake up, you're like, "That sucked, what was it?"
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I think you hear: Ouch.
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AIMEE-
That's it.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Next up is Ted, and then Dariax.
-MATT-
Oh, that's right, I'm in this.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Buddy, you rolled very low.
-AIMEE-
Dariax just wandered off.
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
(laughs) He didn't see what was happening.
-MATT-
I'm finishing half a sandwich in the corner.
What's up? (laughter)
-AIMEE-
One of those old meat pies we had from the-- Oh.
-MATT-
Yeah. (laughs)
-ANJALI-
Some stuff.
-AIMEE-
Thank you.
-ANJALI-
Yep.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, Ted knows a good target when she sees it.
-AIMEE-
Just a fucking mess.
-AABRIA-
She's going to round on you and make a pair of attacks.
-AIMEE-
Ted, be nice.
-AABRIA-
Does a 23 hit?
-ERICA-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Does 18?
-ERICA-
If it's the same, does it hit?
-AABRIA-
Meets it beats it, yeah.
-ERICA-
Okay, gotcha, then yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
♪ Let's get those two in ♪ Oh wait, is that including your Hasted?
-ERICA-
Yes, I've took my AC's 20, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Okay, so the 18 wouldn't hit then?
-ANJALI-
The 18 doesn't hit.
-ERICA-
Oh! Yes!
-AABRIA-
Yeah, okay.
-ERICA-
I was just looking at what I was looking at.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good, you're good, you're good! Cool, cool, cool.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
We love it.
-ERICA-
I don't think there is, is there? Yeah.
-MATT-
It doesn't augment it.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, it doesn't.
-MATT-
It just tells you the spell, what it does.
-ERICA-
I only know how to read things that are there, you know what I mean?
-MATT-
It's okay.
-ROBBIE-
That's how reading works.
-ANJALI-
I'm pretty sure that that's what reading--
-AABRIA-
Cool.
You're going to take 14 points of piercing damage from this dark blade.
-ROBBIE-
Whew.
(sighs)
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Now I need you to make a concentration check to see if your Haste stays up.
-ERICA-
Oh god.
-AABRIA-
So it is half damage, I think I said earlier it was the full damage.
So you just have to beat a 10 with a constitution save.
-ERICA-
All right, well.
Yeah, 19.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're great.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
So wait, okay, this is so small.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ERICA-
Okay, so I take 14 damage?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
She's going to do her best to try to get in and re-interpose herself between you and Opal.
Her primary goal is to keep your attention on her and keep you away from Opal.
-ERICA-
Okay, and you said, sorry, to clarify, the spiders looked at the dick gems, and then also at us? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Wondering what they should?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ERICA-
But I looked at the dick gem and said, "Oh, that looks crushable"?
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You did get a sense of submissive and crushable from these.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
But I think you see in the moment that you hear Opal say, "Ow," you have a vantage point on that spider in the back that lifted up and broke some of the gems that perhaps breaking the gems is bad for Opal.
-ERICA-
Okay, gotcha, no matter who does it.
Great, gotcha.
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ERICA-
Cool, cool, cool, sick.
-AABRIA-
Cool, cool, cool.
That's Ted's turn.
Dariax, you're up.
Opal, you're on deck.
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
-MATT-
All right, seeing all this go down at the get-go, and then everyone rush in, there's a moment of (laughs) Dariax like: What's happening? Then looks over and sees this change in Opal that he still hasn't even processed since all this went down.
There's this pang of worry and sadness that hits him, There's this pang of worry and sadness that hits him, and he's like: Oh, Opal.
He's saying this out loud, he doesn't understand how telepathy works.
He's just--
-AABRIA-
Baby.
My son.
-ANJALI-
Baby.
-MATT-
We're going to get you.
Don't worry, we're going to get you.
Right, everybody, right? He's going to cast Bless at 2nd-level.
-AABRIA-
Goddamn it!
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-MATT-
It's what I do.
-AABRIA-
I hate it here.
(laughs)
-MATT-
So it's three, four, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, pick your four.
-MATT-
No, it's us four here, we all have Bless on us.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
Not Cyrus, who said, "Yeah," from behind the tree?
-ANJALI-
He's here, he's here.
-MATT-
Is Cyrus on the board?
-AABRIA-
There's no Cyrus, he's not on, don't worry.
-ANJALI-
Where is he? Okay.
-AIMEE-
After all the handies, Cyrus? (laughter)
-AABRIA-
You know what? That's right.
Can I get anyone that exists back there bring me anything for Cyrus? We got to--
-MATT-
There might be some minis to your left over there.
-ANJALI-
Would you like 900-- Would you like a die?
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
You can grab one of those.
-AABRIA-
Okay. He's going to be one of these guys.
He got a handjob, he's going to be a part of this.
-AIMEE-
Did it mean nothing to you? (laughter)
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Give me a performance check.
-AIMEE-
Oh boy.
(laughter)
I don't know: Me or him? Oh fuck.
-AABRIA-
I just want to know how good a job you did.
-AIMEE-
Babe.
-AABRIA-
He only rolled a three as initiative so I don't think it's great.
-AIMEE-
Girl, like only a virgin knows how, that is a seven.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
OTBHJ.
-ANJALI-
Woohoo.
-ROBBIE-
Dry, chafing.
-AABRIA-
He's going to stay back here and be like--
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, bad.
-AABRIA-
A three is about as far an initiative, he's like, "Mm, mm." (laughter)
-MATT-
It's a 3rd-level Bless, I'm going to give it to him anyway.
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-ROBBIE-
Oh man.
-ERICA-
Wait, what does that mean for us?
-AIMEE-
1d4, I think.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, it's d4, right or no?
-MATT-
You add a d4 to any attack rolls--
-ERICA-
Oh!
-MATT-
-- ability checks, or saving throws.
-ERICA-
Oh my gosh.
-ANJALI-
Ability checks, too, we like that.
-ERICA-
Plus four attack.
-MATT-
All right, I'm going to be like: We're going to get you, girl, we're going to get you.
(sighs) How do we get her? What are we doing? (laughter)
He's going to start panicking, and he's going to start rushing up to try and join the rest of them in the front.
So he's going to start climbing up the side.
Ha-- Woo-- I don't know what we're doing.
What are we doing?
-ANJALI-
Baby--
-AABRIA-
Where you going? Are you trying to get up here?
-MATT-
Yeah, get up on the edge there.
-AABRIA-
All right, give me athletics or acrobatics.
You're going to pass a little thing of dick gems on the way.
-MATT-
I have a 11 passive perception.
Just goes: Ooh, pretty! And then keeps going.
-AABRIA-
Baby.
-MATT-
Oh. (laughs)
-ANJALI-
Oh no.
-MATT-
That's a seven.
-ROBBIE-
Uh-oh.
-AIMEE-
Ay-yi-yi.
-AABRIA-
What's more important to Dariax in this moment, making it up or preserving himself?
-MATT-
Oh, making it up, he has no sense of self-preservation in this moment.
-AABRIA-
Cool.
Roll a d4 for me.
-MATT-
Okay.
Two.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah, you take two points of scrape-y damage.
-MATT-
Ah, ow, ow, ow.
-AABRIA-
A little bit on your palm.
-ROBBIE-
Ooh, it's the worst.
-AABRIA-
That kind where you're just like, "Ah, it's fresh." Yeah, yeah.
-MATT-
Aw, I hate it.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Then, let's see, as a bonus action, he's going to look over at Dorian across the way after he's been plucked and held in the air, be like: Don't worry, we all believe in you.
You're our fearless leader and you can do this.
-AIMEE-
Oh, what? (laughs)
-MATT-
He's going to give him a d6 bardic inspiration die.
-ANJALI-
Yeah! (cheering)
-MATT-
Taken a few levels of training up under his buddy here.
-ANJALI-
Aw, baby boy.
Baby boy.
-AABRIA-
Little baby boy.
-ROBBIE-
I told you, pursuing a life in the arts isn't worth it! (laughter)
-MATT-
I've done nothing worth anything, so I'm not changing anything in my trajectory.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
You hear a guitar string go (warbles)
-MATT-
Yeah.
(laughter)
-ROBBIE-
Okay, thank you.
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
-MATT-
That's going to be my turn.
-AIMEE-
Aw, shit.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
(sighs) Opal.
-AIMEE-
Now, does Ted, do we have the same abilities?
-AABRIA-
No, Ted has a different skillset than you.
-AIMEE-
I think it's still worth it.
I'm standing close enough to her, right? I'm standing pretty close?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-AIMEE-
Within five feet?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you're within melee.
She keeps interposing herself between you and very specifically Morrighan.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I'm going to say: Ted, first of all, you look great.
Second of all, I know you're just trying to help.
But I'm going to cast Darkness on both of us.
-AABRIA-
So Darkness is an AoE.
-AIMEE-
What does that mean?
-AABRIA-
So you pick a point in the world to cast it on.
-AIMEE-
Right where I am and she is.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ERICA-
How big is the AoE?
-AABRIA-
How big is your Darkness? (gasps) I get to use. (gasps)
-AIMEE-
I'll tell you.
-AABRIA-
Thank you.
(sniffs) I'm so happy.
-ANJALI-
Oh. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
This is so good, I never get to play with these.
-AIMEE-
Okay, so (laughs) 15-foot radius.
-ROBBIE-
15 radius.
-ANJALI-
Mm, no.
-AABRIA-
Centered entirely on you.
That's going to catch everyone.
-ANJALI-
Oh no.
-ROBBIE-
Oh no.
Do any of you have the ability to see through magical darkness?
Magical darkness?
-MATT-
No. (laughs)
-AABRIA-
Not darkvision.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
No, I don't.
-AIMEE-
I do.
-MATT-
(laughs) Oh no.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you do.
-ROBBIE-
Aw, you creep.
-MATT-
That's awesome!
-ROBBIE-
How long have you been planning this?
-ERICA-
My god.
-ANJALI-
Fuck me!
-MATT-
I love it.
-AIMEE-
I get the Paul Hollywood handshake, my sweaty fucking hand.
-MATT-
Yeah!
-AIMEE-
Just like-- (strains)
-MATT-
That's legit.
-AABRIA-
With all the love in my heart: Fuck 'em up.
-AIMEE-
Aw.
Well, I was just trying to get Ted not to fuck 'em up.
-AABRIA-
No no.
-AIMEE-
But I think that's the only thing I can do, and I burned a spell slot, one of my three.
-ERICA-
Does that mean we can't see?
-AIMEE-
You can't see shit.
-AABRIA-
You can't see anything.
-MATT-
We're essentially blind.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, I think that's all I can do except for move.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-AIMEE-
I don't want to move, because if I move--
-AABRIA-
Why not?
-AIMEE-
Well, let me ask you this, so it's 15-foot radius, if I move--
-AABRIA-
So it's technically a static-- Look, I understand I've tried to cheese this a lot where you're like, "I put it on my body so I'm always the center of it." Technically, it's a fixed point in the world.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
So then I'm definitely not going to move, right, because--
-AABRIA-
So you can move around and stay in--
-AIMEE-
Within--
-AABRIA-
Where you dropped it is where this is, it's not going to move with you.
So you can move, you will not provoke opportunity attacks.
-AIMEE-
Well, then I would say that, (sighs) I mean, I don't want to, but for the purposes of this, I would probably move us there so we could get a good shot of everyone.
-AABRIA-
Perfect.
-AIMEE-
Oh yeah.
-AABRIA-
You're there.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, okay, gotcha.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, Ted's going to stay and keep doing the damn thing.
-ANJALI-
So is that still in darkness?
-AIMEE-
Can she?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
And am I in darkness?
-AABRIA-
You are not in darkness.
-ANJALI-
But everybody else is gone.
-AABRIA-
But what you do see is a big old dome of dark.
-ANJALI-
A void.
-AABRIA-
You cannot see inside it.
-AIMEE-
They can't see me, but I can see them?
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-MATT-
Correct.
-AABRIA-
You have perfect vision on everyone.
-MATT-
Shit.
-AABRIA-
But do you know what you do have?
-AIMEE-
What?
-AABRIA-
You got a little buddy.
-AIMEE-
(gasps)
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Your familiar can act on this turn.
-AIMEE-
I don't want to.
-AABRIA-
I need you to kill them.
-AIMEE-
Okay, well.
I don't know what my familiar can do, actually.
Can my familiar do anything, or what can it do? It's a spider.
-ANJALI-
I need to pee so bad already.
-AABRIA-
Just go pee.
-AIMEE-
Go pee.
-ANJALI-
No, I don't want to miss anything!
-AABRIA-
Go pee, you're good.
-ANJALI-
No, we're going to watch.
-MATT-
♪ Don't wanna miss a thing ♪
-AABRIA-
What? If you pee now, you won't miss anything because we're just looking up how Find Familiar works.
-ANJALI-
Look really slow, okay?
-AIMEE-
Oh, here.
-ANJALI-
♪ I can't miss a thing ♪
-AIMEE-
Well, I got that.
-AABRIA-
Don't piss long.
-AIMEE-
♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah ♪
-ANJALI-
I don't even know where to go.
-AIMEE-
"Your familiar acts independently, but obeys your command."
-ROBBIE-
Oh my god, what's happening is so cool right now.
(laughter)
-ERICA-
Whoa!
-AABRIA-
Sweet.
-AIMEE-
"It can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal."
-AABRIA-
Correct.
-ERICA-
The dick gems are sentient!
-AABRIA-
I will say, an important thing for your familiar is it can deliver touch spells on your behalf.
-ERICA-
They're talking to us.
-AABRIA-
So you can set up future things if you want with it.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Also, you can use it to give yourself the help action--
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
-- so that when you attack something, you attack it with advantage, which you're already doing because nothing can see anything.
-AIMEE-
So then I guess I will go to, because she's not here, thankfully, she can't hear me do it.
Can I have my familiar make some movement towards Fy'ra Rai?
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
I don't know where it is.
-AABRIA-
Let's get you a little guy.
I ran out of normal tiny spiders because I used them all.
Where did I find the little one?
-ROBBIE-
Them all?
-AABRIA-
Huh?
-ROBBIE-
(laughs) You used them all?
-AABRIA-
I used them all; I could've used a different boy.
It's funny, I'm going to bring out a very big guy.
-ERICA-
Please don't do that.
-AABRIA-
Ooh, okay, I understand, we all understand emotionally that it's a spider, but I'm going to use this really cute little squirrel.
-AIMEE-
Cute, oh my gosh.
-ROBBIE-
Oh yeah!
-AIMEE-
Squirrel?
-AABRIA-
He's a little guy.
-AIMEE-
Squirrel!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Squirrel's going to get, oop, right up next to Fy'ra Rai.
-ROBBIE-
Spider squirrel, uh-oh.
-AABRIA-
♪ Spider squirrel ♪
-ANJALI-
Spider squirrel?
-AABRIA-
Uh-huh.
-AIMEE-
Spider squirrel, girl.
-AABRIA-
So Opal's familiar just crawled out of the darkness and is looking up at you and does the little hairy jumping spider, like (hisses). (laughs)
-AIMEE-
Can I do anything or that's the whole turn?
-AABRIA-
That's it, that's your turn.
-ANJALI-
Does it look fierce? (laughs) Does it look like it's--
-AIMEE-
I think it's just a tiny baby spider. (laughs)
-ANJALI-
-- on my side or not?
-AIMEE-
It's got cute eyes.
-AABRIA-
You know what? Insight check.
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Ooh.
-AABRIA-
(gasps) Aw, look at the guy.
-ROBBIE-
That's perfect.
-AABRIA-
And a little dick.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god, it really does.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
You did that.
-AABRIA-
Blame Dani, we were trying to come up with an array that you all could see.
-ANJALI-
22.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-ANJALI-
22.
-AABRIA-
22.
-AIMEE-
Dani's like, "They can see dicks."
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You see that this thing has never attacked you, probably cannot attack you, but is trying to set up something for the future.
-ANJALI-
Oh no.
-AABRIA-
So is not necessarily friendly to you, this is not it going like, "Please, please, help my mistress."
-ANJALI-
Above, I don't know, what do you call it? Above table, above game in a way--
-AABRIA-
Sure. (laughs)
-ANJALI-
-- things.
Do we know how-- Do we know what happens to her familiar if it goes under zero hit points, if it dies?
-AIMEE-
I think it dies, or just go away, let me see.
-AABRIA-
It goes away, this is a thing that happened before, I believe, in Kymal.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
Oh, that's right.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it goes away, and then she has to spend an hour re-summoning it, and I'm pretty sure Opal's bitched about how hard it is.
-ANJALI-
Excellent, okay, fantastic.
-AABRIA-
But it's fine.
Perfect.
(laughs) Yeah, at the bottom of the order, Cyrus goes, "I can't see anything." (quiet laughter)
"Hey, bro."
-ROBBIE-
Yes? Yes?
-AABRIA-
Bro, can you hear me? It's dark in there. (laughs)
-ROBBIE-
I am blind, not deaf.
Yes, go on.
-AABRIA-
"You're in-- It's dark where you are."
-ROBBIE-
Urine, there's urine somewhere?
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
"Like a little bit, but we don't have to talk about it right now.
I'll get it in a second.
I'm very nervous."
-ROBBIE-
It's okay, I'm scared, too.
-AABRIA-
"Yeah, what do you want me to do?"
-ROBBIE-
I don't know, what do you see around you?
-AABRIA-
"Big-ass black bubble."
-ROBBIE-
Whoa, bubble, don't punch the bubble.
-AABRIA-
"You want me to punch the bubble?"
-ROBBIE-
No, don't punch the bubble.
-AABRIA-
"I can shoot it with my arrow."
-ROBBIE-
No, no, don't!
-ERICA-
All of us in unison.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
No.
-AABRIA-
He turns.
"Okay, okay, okay.
What do I do?"
-ROBBIE-
Kill a spider.
In general, they're bad.
-AABRIA-
"Okay." (laughs) He's going to peek around this corner and come all the way over here.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
And unleash on this spider in front him.
-ERICA-
Hell yeah, hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
He's still level six. (laughs)
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
-ROBBIE-
What?!
-AABRIA-
What?
-ROBBIE-
He hasn't learned anything?
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
He would not be a himbo if he had learned a lesson.
-ANJALI-
He was too busy getting handjobs.
-AABRIA-
Frankly, I think it's crazy that Dariax is so high level.
-ANJALI-
He was too busy spending time trying to allow Opal to give bad handies.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
He was level 10, but the handy was so bad.
-AIMEE-
She's learning.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) It just busted his ass back down to six.
-AIMEE-
Not good.
-ANJALI-
I can't unsee that, I can't unfeel that.
-AIMEE-
Not good.
-ROBBIE-
How do you do?
-ANJALI-
Oh gosh.
-AABRIA-
You see hi-- None of you see anything.
Fy'ra Rai.
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
You actually see Cyrus unleashes a bow and it glances off the big bubble butt of this spider--
-AIMEE-
(laughs) Bubble butt.
-AABRIA-
-- bubble butt, harmlessly.
The spider rears back, and he's like, "Fuck."
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Do better!
-AABRIA-
"Help." (laughter)
"Help, help." He is staring at you going, "Help, help." The spider hasn't moved, (laughs) he's just nervous about the future.
And we are back up to the top.
Morrighan, you're up, it is dark as shit.
-ERICA-
It's dark as shit.
Did I see where Fy'ra was before?
-AABRIA-
Wait, hold on. There's one more thing I want to do.
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
I always forget between rounds.
-ERICA-
Classic, classic.
-AABRIA-
We're at round two now.
-MATT-
We are.
-AABRIA-
It's dark.
-ANJALI-
(groans)
-MATT-
It's going to be fine, we're fine.
-AABRIA-
I need everyone, including Opal, to make a wisdom saving throw.
-MATT-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Difficulty's 18.
-ROBBIE-
Uh-oh.
Aw.
-ERICA-
A wisdom save? Oh my god.
-AIMEE-
18.
No.
Hold on, why can't I add?
-AABRIA-
I don't know.
-AIMEE-
18, exactly 18.
12 plus six is 18.
-AABRIA-
Okay, perfect.
12 plus six is 18, you're perfect.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, you got to be--
-AABRIA-
Meets it beats it.
-ANJALI-
Oh, plus everybody gets four.
All of us get four--
-ERICA-
Oh yeah, yeah.
-ANJALI-
-- because of Bless.
-AABRIA-
You do all get a plus four on saves.
Not you, Opal.
-AIMEE-
It's okay.
-AABRIA-
But you made it, so you're okay.
-ANJALI-
26.
-ERICA-
Oh, 18.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) 26.
Yeah, you make it.
-ERICA-
Oh wait.
Plus four or plus a d4?
-ANJALI-
Plus a d4, oh sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It wasn't 26, it was 22.
-AIMEE-
Oh, Matt.
-AABRIA-
That's just on attack rolls.
-AIMEE-
Oh, buddy.
-AABRIA-
Attack rolls and--
-ERICA-
19.
and saving throws.
-ANJALI-
26.
-ERICA-
19, 19.
-AABRIA-
19.
-ROBBIE-
18 minus one, plus two, baby.
-AABRIA-
Yay!
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Thanks, bud.
-MATT-
17, minus one.
-AIMEE-
No.
-ANJALI-
Oh, plus?
-MATT-
Plus one, so 17.
-ANJALI-
Yay.
-AIMEE-
All right.
We've got it.
-ROBBIE-
I think we might've cracked this.
-MATT-
Yep.
-ERICA-
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, are within 10 feet of me?
-MATT-
I am.
-ERICA-
You have plus three to-- Anyone within 10 feet of me gets a plus three bonus to all saving throws.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Yeah!
-ERICA-
Aura of Protection, baby!
-ANJALI-
20, baby!
-MATT-
Hell yeah!
-ERICA-
Paladin power!
-ANJALI-
Let's go!
-MATT-
Appreciate that!
-AABRIA-
Love it.
-ERICA-
It's in the rules!
-AIMEE-
It's in the rules.
-AABRIA-
It's in the rules! The rules of the game say I can do this.
-MATT-
That's awesome.
Hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
-ROBBIE-
I finally got a decent roll.
-AABRIA-
You all feel something wash over you.
A sense of helplessness, of momentum shifting.
You reach towards the magic that you share with one another and shake it off.
It is artificial and foreign to you, pressed on you by the magic of the Spider Queen that is trying to get you to leave Opal alone.
Back up to the top.
Morrighan, you're up.
-ERICA-
Did I see where Fy'ra was before we all got dark?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-ERICA-
So I did?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ERICA-
Could I roughly estimate that perhaps I wanted to rabbit hop over to her?
-AABRIA-
You could try.
-ERICA-
All right.
I'm going to go, I'm going to yell out.
-AABRIA-
Have you ever jumped in the pure dark? It's not a matter--
-ERICA-
Absolutely, I'm in Kymal all the time.
It's dark all the time, and I'm in vaults, and those are dark.
So yeah, obviously.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Pew, pew, pew!
-MATT-
That's confidence!
-ERICA-
Obviously.
-AIMEE-
(party horn)
-AABRIA-
Love that.
-ERICA-
I move in the darkness.
I slither, I slide.
-ANJALI-
And hop! (laughter)
-AIMEE-
I half believe it.
-ANJALI-
She hippity-hops.
-AABRIA-
"I slither, I slide."
-ANJALI-
I hippity-hop and I pop.
-ERICA-
I slip and slide, it's dark in there.
Casinos are all dark and seedy.
You know how it goes.
-ERICA-
The Maiden's Wish was dark all the time.
They had electrical issues.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Do we have electricity?
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
In Exandria?
-MATT-
On a small scale.
-ERICA-
I could make and AMF in the dark.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-MATT-
In Whitestone.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good.
-ERICA-
Sorry.
-AABRIA-
No, you're good, you're good, you're good.
-ERICA-
The flames were bad.
-AIMEE-
The candles were wet all the time.
-ERICA-
The candles were so wet!
-AIMEE-
Why?
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Okay, I'm going to have you make an acrobatics check with disadvantage to bunny hop.
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
It's not a matter of can you figure out how to jump, it's, the hard thing about jumping is knowing how to prep yourself to land when you don't see where you're going.
-ERICA-
What if I Misty Step? Does that change it?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Oh! (satisfied laugh) Okay.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead.
-ERICA-
I'm going to Misty Step then.
I'm going to use my-- Yeah.
I'm going to use my bonus action.
Can I yell out to Fy'ra? Can I just yell out to her to place her with my big old ears that I have?
-AABRIA-
Oh hold on.
It does say, "You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see."
-ERICA-
(groans)
-AABRIA-
So.
-ERICA-
That does present a problem.
-AABRIA-
It does.
-ERICA-
All right, I'm going to--
-AABRIA-
A little blind jumpity jump or you can try to blind Misty Step.
-ERICA-
You know what? (groans)
-AABRIA-
I just might hurt you to do it.
-ERICA-
I only have a plus two acrobatics, so that's why I'm like-- My athletics is really good.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, this is more of a stick the landing so you don't give yourself a stinger in your big old bunny ankles.
-ERICA-
Wait, do I have, because of my Vow of Enmity, or because of Haste do I have-- No, that's just on attack.
-MATT-
You get to add a d4 to it, though.
-ANJALI-
Add a d4
-ERICA-
Oh! Okay, okay.
-ANJALI-
That's it, that's it.
-ERICA-
I'll roll at disadvantage.
-ANJALI-
Oh no, that's--
-ERICA-
Just to see.
-MATT-
Yeah, skill check.
-ERICA-
Just to see how it goes.
-MATT-
I think it is.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
It's not a skill check.
-MATT-
No, it's not!
-AABRIA-
It's attack rolls and saves.
-MATT-
Saving rolls, you're right.
So now you don't do anything.
-ERICA-
Okay, so that's--
-MATT-
Thank you.
-ERICA-
-- 10, 11, 12 plus-- Oh wait is it d4?
-ANJALI-
d4.
Yep, you're right.
-ERICA-
That's a d4.
-MATT-
Don't add a d4, I was wrong.
-AABRIA-
No, you don't add a d4 to this.
-ERICA-
Oh.
-MATT-
I was wrong.
That was me. I was wrong.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it's all good.
-ERICA-
That's a 12.
-AABRIA-
I never remember how Bless works.
-MATT-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Then, that's a eight.
Yeah. 12 and an eight.
-AABRIA-
So total an eight?
-ERICA-
So an eight, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Okay. You go to bound out and away.
-ANJALI-
Eight plus two.
-ERICA-
No, six, seven, eight.
-ANJALI-
Oh, like I said. Okay.
-ERICA-
Yeah, like we said.
-AABRIA-
Like you said.
-ERICA-
I feel like that's a great roll.
-AABRIA-
You bound out and away.
You get clear of it and you're like, "Jumped a little higher than I thought." Gonna land a little harder than you thought.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Go ahead and roll a d8 for me.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
I'm going to use the die equivalent to the roll you made.
-ERICA-
A five.
-AABRIA-
Take five points of damage.
-ERICA-
Cool, but do I land near her?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, you can land exactly where you were headed.
-ERICA-
Amazing.
-AABRIA-
It's just a matter of having that problem of like, "Oh my god."
-ERICA-
Absolutely, that's totally fine.
-AABRIA-
Stinger.
-ERICA-
That puts me at, oh god, oh wait.
(gags) 79. Okay.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
I literally cannot count, you don't understand.
It's so bad.
-AABRIA-
That's okay.
-ERICA-
I have squirrel brain.
-AABRIA-
You're doing great.
-ERICA-
Okay, so I'm right next to Fy'ra.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ERICA-
Correct? Okay, great.
I am going to-- I feel-- Sorry, for a little bit of flavor, I am really thinking about what Ted said.
Honestly, it's kind of negated by the fact that they threw the first punch, for sure, by sucker punching Fy'ra.
But also, why was that my first reaction? I feel the blood and I can't even see it, and it's so sticky.
It just feels really wrong and bad and I'm sitting there waiting for the Matron of Ravens to, I don't know, say something to me.
But I need to do something other than make something bleed.
So I hop over to Fy'ra, and I look at her and I take my hand and I slam it on her arm and I heal her with my Lay on Hands pool.
-ANJALI-
Thank you.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ERICA-
I'll heal you for as much as you're damaged.
-ANJALI-
That's a lot, are you sure?
-ERICA-
Is that 30?
-ANJALI-
It's 31.
-ERICA-
It's fine, yeah.
-ANJALI-
All right.
-AABRIA-
All right.
-MATT-
Slick.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
What is 65 minus 31?
-AABRIA-
Who could say?
-ANJALI-
34.
-AABRIA-
34.
-ERICA-
Name your names, you know? (laughs)
-AABRIA-
Name your names.
That's going to live inside of my body in a really fun way.
"Name your names." It's a challenge.
-ERICA-
31, right?
-AABRIA-
It's an opportunity.
-ERICA-
Yeah. 31, okay.
I'm going to say, I'm going to look at her and say, maybe you can bring this to a less bloody conclusion than I would.
Then do I have another action?
-AABRIA-
Because you're hasted.
-ERICA-
Because of my haste?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
Man, I need to get some fucking Haste.
-ERICA-
Is that little spider fucker, is he near me?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Great.
I'm going to stab him.
-AIMEE-
Stabby stab, stab.
-ANJALI-
Stabby, stab.
-ERICA-
Great. I'm going to stab--
-AABRIA-
That's her familiar.
-ERICA-
I don't care!
-AABRIA-
Okay, I'm just saying.
-ERICA-
It's not Opal.
It's not Opal, it's a spider.
-AABRIA-
All I'm going to say, you can absolutely do it, but if you, going off of your stated intent to find something other to do, than to make something bleed.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
I will say you have an opportunity to commune with your deity.
-ERICA-
Oh, the Raven Queen.
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Or, right behind you is a big old dick of gems.
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
Well, I don't want to crush the gems.
-AABRIA-
Right, crushing isn't the only option.
You felt, again, as your foot passed over it you're like, "What magical shit is happening right here?"
-ERICA-
Okay, what do I with though? Wait, what do I do with it other than crush it?
-ANJALI-
Could I have responded to her?
-AIMEE-
Wear it.
-AABRIA-
Sure, yeah.
You turn to her, you're like, "What the fuck do I do with that dick of gems?"
-ANJALI-
I will say, as you heal me, save some of it for Opal, we will need it.
Get as many gems as you can.
-ERICA-
Okay.
Okay.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
I'll hop, I'll go walk over to the gems.
-AABRIA-
There's one literally right behind you.
It's a matter of turning around.
-ERICA-
Oh, I can't see.
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah, sorry.
-ANJALI-
It's also on the screen--
-AABRIA-
You've got a little grouping right here behind you.
-ANJALI-
-- over there if it helps.
-ERICA-
Okay.
Then I'm going to reach down and try to grab them, I guess.
-AABRIA-
You reach out and grab them and you pull them away from this sticky spider web.
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
As you take them into you and you hold them, and your intention here is to protect them?
-ERICA-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Not break them.
There is something in that intention and in that choice that triggers a memory.
-ERICA-
(amazed revelation)
-AABRIA-
You understand suddenly that you are holding on to some portion of Opal, a bond between the two of you.
Something that, if destroyed by the Spider Queen or her minions, she will lose forever, and part of it is her connection to you.
You think back to when you were still floating so slowly on the brumestone platform.
-AIMEE-
(slowly grinding gears) (laughter)
-AABRIA-
You had all given up your huffing and puffing and doggy piling behind and it's just of a quiet moment.
The rest of the group is sleeping, and you had an opportunity to quietly talk.
At this point, that raven that you know was connected to the Matron of Ravens has flown away, but there's something in the feeling inside of you.
You have not been selected, you haven't made a choice yet, but the connection you feel is there.
You have an opportunity as the sun drops behind the mountains to speak quietly and calmly.
-ERICA-
Can I ask you a question?
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
When you-- When you took that vestige, how did you know it was the right thing to do?
-AIMEE-
Oh, I didn't.
I kind of-- It was the thing to do at the time.
I don't think we ever really know.
But, it doesn't feel bad to have a purpose.
-ERICA-
(exhales heavily) That's all I've wanted my entire life.
(exhales heavily)
-AIMEE-
You're so good at so many things.
-ERICA-
I don't know.
I see you and everyone else and it's just-- I wouldn't have survived without you.
-AIMEE-
Oh, yes you would have.
I mean, you survived in that dump for all these years.
-ERICA-
It was pretty bad.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ERICA-
I don't know, I know it's hard and you're going through a lot, but, I just want you to know that I think you're really cool.
-AIMEE-
Oh my gosh, I think you're really cool! If I could just have a little bit of your personality, you're so confident.
I mean, not in this moment, but usually you're confident and just so sexy, and that's-- But more than anything else, it kind of seems like, I don't know, like you have an inner strength that I don't have.
Not yet.
I'm still young.
But I mean, you're young too. Oh my god.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
I can't! I can't.
(lingering laughter)
-AIMEE-
You know, when I first saw you at the Maiden's Wish, I thought, oh no.
Another pretty girl.
But then I got to know you and I was like, oh wait, actually, if we put our heads together, we can do anything, and look good doing it.
-ERICA-
I love that for us.
-AIMEE-
I know that sounds really stupid.
-ERICA-
No!
-AIMEE-
But, there's nothing like being underestimated.
-ERICA-
Under promise.
-ERICA-
I like that.
-AIMEE-
Me too.
-ERICA-
I think you're really pretty, too.
I think we're both pretty in like different ways.
-AIMEE-
Totally. So it actually really balances it out.
-ERICA-
Absolutely, yeah.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
Hey, I think you're so good at so many different things.
If this doesn't feel like the right purpose for you, then maybe it's just a purpose for a season.
You don't have to stick to it.
I mean, I have to stick to this.
It's stuck to my head.
I've tried to take it off.
-ERICA-
It's on there.
-AIMEE-
It's on there good, yeah.
Then she shows her real look, and it's just gruesome.
-ERICA-
Oh, oh my god.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, sorry.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Morri, it's getting a little infected.
-ERICA-
What?
-AABRIA-
It's getting a little infected.
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-AIMEE-
I know, I'm trying my best.
But if you just need someone to give you permission to just follow your heart, you have it.
-ERICA-
Thank you, Opal.
-AIMEE-
You're welcome.
-AABRIA-
You feel yourself move back from that.
Those gems that you claimed here the Spider Queen can never take, and Opal keeps a pillar of her personality and a connection to you.
-ERICA-
Aw, that's so cute.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
So sweet.
-AABRIA-
Who are you saying that to?
-ERICA-
Aw, that's so sweet.
I don't know, I'm just holding these gems!
Aw!
-AIMEE-
You just hear: Under promise--
-ERICA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
-- over deliver.
-ANJALI-
Aw!
-ERICA-
Aw, and I look and I see her blood on these dick gems.
-AABRIA-
Anything else?
-ERICA-
I don't think--
-AABRIA-
Scrillion points of movement, if you're trying to--
-ERICA-
Oh yeah, I have a septillion point.
-AABRIA-
-- be somewhere else.
Yeah.
-ERICA-
I'm next to Fy'ra.
I actually think I'm good, question mark? I'm out of the dark, right?
-AABRIA-
(laugh) Yeah, you're good.
-ERICA-
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
I'll just hang out.
-AABRIA-
The question mark killed me, that was great.
(laughs)
-ERICA-
See what happens.
I'm on it today.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
Dorian, you're up.
Fy'ra Rai, you're on deck.
-ROBBIE-
After this deep, true, feminine bonding-- (laughter)
-AIMEE-
Cyrus was in the background of that flashback like-- (sleazy, suggestive winking) (laughter)
-AABRIA-
It's bad.
All of you saw that across the telepathic bond.
-AIMEE-
Aw!
-AABRIA-
The moment you interacted with those gems--
-AIMEE-
So sweet.
-AABRIA-
-- you triggered the memory of it between the two of you, but because you are all telepathically bonded, it is something you all--
-AIMEE-
That's cool.
-AABRIA-
-- can and did see.
-AIMEE-
Love that.
-AABRIA-
Those of you that weren't there get a new thing.
So some of you have that strange instance of: Oh, I was asleep right there, but now I'm getting a different viewpoint of it.
-ANJALI-
Wow.
-AABRIA-
Which is weird.
-ERICA-
Oh.
Do I have anything else I can do? Can I yell something?
-AABRIA-
Oh sure! Sure, sure, sure.
-ERICA-
Okay.
Because it wasn't intuitive for me to grab the gems, I was going to stab them, which is very much where Morrighan's head is.
But I'll just yell: Grab as many jewels as you can!
-ANJALI-
That's what I said! (laughter)
-ERICA-
I was just saying it louder!
-AIMEE-
Not Fy'ra Rai being so bossy, I love it.
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-MATT-
I don't know who to listen to!
-ROBBIE-
I can't see shit!
-AABRIA-
We heard "Bossy Genasi" up top and she went--
-ERICA-
We're saying the same thing!
-ANJALI-
I am just being on brand!
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Bossy Genasi is apparently my name now.
-AIMEE-
Oh my god. Obsessed.
-AABRIA-
Incredible.
-MATT-
Love it.
-AABRIA-
Hey, bud.
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to fly straight up.
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-ANJALI-
Yes!
-ROBBIE-
In the darkness.
-AIMEE-
That's smart.
-ROBBIE-
Ascend out of the dome.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah.
Is that okay? It's 15-foot, a dome of influence?
Oh my god, Matt, you've got so much cool shit!
-MATT-
That's what I leave them there for.
-ANJALI-
Look at that!
-AABRIA-
I love it.
I love it here!
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to--
-ANJALI-
I've always put Dorian on a pedestal.
-ROBBIE-
-- traverse it a little.
Now I can see, and I go: Huh! (laughs) (laughter)
I've got so much, I am weighed down with so much shit, but I fish around in my backpack for this little mandolin that my boy Dariax gave me.
-AABRIA-
(gasps) Oh!
-ROBBIE-
I strum a beautiful harmonic tune, and with my Canaith mandolin, I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on the Darkness.
-MATT-
Oh!
-ANJALI-
Baby!
-ROBBIE-
So, I think that just works? What level is Darkness?
-AIMEE-
5th-level.
-ROBBIE-
Oh fuck! That might not work.
-ERICA-
5th-level, but you can do 7th.
-ROBBIE-
5th-level?
-AABRIA-
I'm sorry, do you think we came to fucking play?
-ROBBIE-
I didn't know it was 5th-level.
I don't think I've got that capability.
-AABRIA-
Let me--
-ROBBIE-
All right, is that--
-AABRIA-
What if I Googled anything to help.
-AIMEE-
I also have it, I can--
-MATT-
I think you roll for it to see if you dispel that.
-AABRIA-
I think it is a roll.
-AIMEE-
It's a roll.
-AABRIA-
It's a roll.
-AIMEE-
Please pass the rolls.
Anyone know that?
-AABRIA-
I heard piss.
-ERICA-
I heard piss, too.
-ANJALI-
I did, too.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! ERICA and ANJALI: Please piss the rolls.
I simply won't.
-AIMEE-
Please piss the rolls.
-AABRIA-
I've never played D&amp;D, so it's pretty exciting to see this for the first time.
-AIMEE-
Oh no, I don't have that.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, oh, oh. Yeah.
-AABRIA-
You're going to make an ability check using your spellcasting ability.
The DC equals 10 plus the spell's level.
On a successful check, the spell ends.
-AIMEE-
What do I do here?
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
So it would be--
-AABRIA-
You can cast Counterspell.
-AIMEE-
Yeah, but-- Sorry, I'm confused.
So he's going to roll for something.
-AABRIA-
Yes, he's going to make an attempt, there's nothing you can do.
-AIMEE-
For sure. Then what does it have to beat?
-ROBBIE-
Is it my spell attack?
-AABRIA-
10 plus the spell's level, so it's going to be 15.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, a 15.
-MATT-
It's the ability check.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
So, you roll and add your charisma.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, I roll a what?
-ANJALI-
You add your charisma.
-MATT-
You roll a d20 and add your charisma.
-AABRIA-
Plus--
-ROBBIE-
Add my charisma.
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- three.
-AIMEE-
Then I don't have a reaction until I find out what that is?
-AABRIA-
You can see it happening.
So you're like, oh, you're casting magic.
You can Counterspell it if you want.
-ROBBIE-
I'm flying over it.
-AIMEE-
But what if it doesn't work?
-ROBBIE-
We'll see.
-AABRIA-
We'll find out.
-ROBBIE-
Hiya!
-ANJALI-
(laughs) It bounced.
That doesn't count.
-ROBBIE-
Hiya. Same roll.
-ANJALI-
Oh my god.
-ERICA-
You got the same roll!
-ANJALI-
That's impressively--
-ROBBIE-
Impossible that it jumped up there and did that.
-AABRIA-
Oh no, it's consistent.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, dog shit.
-AIMEE-
(exhales) Thank god.
-ROBBIE-
Nine.
I'm just shit at my rolls.
Yeah, I fly over and I try to cast it at Darkness, and-- (mouth fart) (laughter)
I'm still flying, I was like, oh damn!
-AIMEE-
Oh no!
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
I go, did he just fart?
-AIMEE-
He knows how to jump to fart.
-ERICA-
(laughs)
-ROBBIE-
Dariax is still in darkness?
-AABRIA-
No, if you tried to fly high enough to be over the darkness--
-MATT-
No, he is.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-MATT-
I am.
-AABRIA-
Oh, Dariax is still in the darkness, yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah, yeah.
-AABRIA-
Damn it, I knew I was going to confuse--
-AIMEE-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
-- your stupid fucking names!
-MATT-
(laughs) We're back, baby!
-AABRIA-
I hate it here!
-AIMEE-
I just want to say Doriax.
-AABRIA-
There's so many letters, and you didn't pick any different ones.
-ROBBIE-
My intent was to dispel the magic and fly over and land next to Dariax, but I'm in flight, and it's all happened, my failure happened too quickly to where I could really have a different plan.
So, I'm going to try the same plan.
I'm going to try to use my mind's eye and imagine where Dariax would be in the darkness based on my keen spacial awareness and drop down next to my buddy below me about 15 feet.
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Okay, here's what we're going to do together.
-AABRIA-
I need you to make--
-AIMEE-
You're going back into the dark?
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-AIMEE-
That's love!
-ROBBIE-
I'm with my friend.
-AABRIA-
That is love.
-ERICA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
♪ Together ♪
-AABRIA-
Give me an acrobatics check.
-ROBBIE-
Acrobatics check?
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
Good thing I'm super good at that!
-ERICA-
Ooh!
-ROBBIE-
27.
-MATT-
Woo!
-ERICA-
Nice.
-AABRIA-
You're great.
You flutter in, and because you're using your little feet flappies--
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
-- Dariax, you can hear him coming in hot.
You can give him a little landing.
-MATT-
Hey, what's up, man? I got you, I got you! I'm tugging at his ankle, trying to help him get to the ground a little bit.
-AABRIA-
You get grabbed by the foot and yanked down.
-AIMEE-
A shoe comes off.
-ROBBIE-
I'm going to feel around in the darkness for him, his little broad shoulders.
You do a great job, buddy.
I'm going to tap him on his shoulder and return the bardic inspiration as well.
So we're both super goosed up.
-AABRIA-
These little guys--
-ROBBIE-
We're helping each other out.
-AAABRIA-
-- just trading their little bardics.
-AIMEE-
They need a spin-off.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
-AIMEE-
That would be so cute.
-ROBBIE-
Where's my 10?
-AABRIA-
We could do one in the afterlife.
-MATT-
If you want I can just--
-ROBBIE-
I know, I know.
I want to get it.
-AIMEE-
I was like yeah! No.
-AABRIA-
Oh.
-AIMEE-
I know.
-MATT-
There it is.
-ROBBIE-
Oh man, and that finishes my turn.
I burned my spell on the Dispel and that's it.
That's all I can do.
-AABRIA-
I'm sorry.
Can you roll better?
-ROBBIE-
I'm trying!
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
I was just asking, I was just asking.
-ROBBIE-
I'm trying!
-MATT-
Damn!
-AABRIA-
I was just asking!
-AIMEE-
Burn!
-AABRIA-
I'm just asking questions.
-MATT-
Vicious!
-AABRIA-
I'm just asking questions.
-ROBBIE-
It's a big bag.
-ERICA-
Did you say he was using his little feet flappies?
-ANJALI-
He's got little winged boots.
-ERICA-
I like the idea--
-AABRIA-
He's got little winged boots.
-ERICA-
-- of the wind boots struggling to just--
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-ERICA-
-- keep him where he needs to be.
-AABRIA-
The boots are great.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
I think they see his lack of confidence in his ability and they're like, aw, shit.
They got the yips in they're like: (stuttered flapping) (laughter)
Bring it in.
(laughter)
Fy'ra Rai, you are up.
-ANJALI-
Cool.
The dick gems that are near me and Morrighan, are those the ones that she picked up?
-AABRIA-
Yeah, she grabbed these.
Here you go, that's for you.
-ERICA-
Those aren't dick gems.
Oh, yeah they are!
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
Whoa, I thought you were just throwing me a spider web, but there's dick gems on this spider web.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah!
-ANJALI-
Is there one-- What about the one that I ran over that I felt?
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Yes, there are some under your feet right here.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-ERICA-
I love these dick gems!
-AABRIA-
It's like 10 feet to your left. Can you see?
-ANJALI-
Okay.
Since I can't see my girl.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, right there.
-AIMEE-
Is she way out of melee from--
-ANJALI-
I can't see the guys, can't see anything but these--
-AABRIA-
Your familiar can't attack.
-ANJALI-
-- fucking spiders.
Cool, cool, cool.
-AABRIA-
Tight, tight, tight.
-ANJALI-
What I would like to do--
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ANJALI-
-- is to begin using my movement to run and scoop those up and continue in the direction.
-ERICA-
I just choked on my water.
-ANJALI-
I believe there are more right next to, underneath Dariax at the foot of the--
-ERICA-
I'm okay. I'm okay.
-ANJALI-
So there's the ones next to me and then there's also the ones underneath Dariax at the foot of the wall?
-AABRIA-
Yup, start here.
-ANJALI-
Uh-huh.
-AABRIA-
Because it is an interaction.
-ANJALI-
Right, okay.
While that is happening, though, I'd like to check in with the Wildmother again, if I may.
-AABRIA-
You got a lot of things going.
You're cooking a lot at once, my guy.
-ANJALI-
Okay, so I can't.
-AABRIA-
So, let's go one at a time and we'll see how it goes.
-ANJALI-
Okay, cool.
-AABRIA-
You move 10 feet to your left and scoop up this array of gems.
-ANJALI-
Mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
I guess it's it's vaguely dick-like, if you're a child.
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
You scoop them up and--
-ANJALI-
I've been hanging around with Opal for awhile.
I'm picking things up from my girl.
-MATT-
She tends to rub off on ya.
-ANJALI-
Hey!
-AIMEE-
Ey!
-AABRIA-
It's only like seven good, though, so you don't like it.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
Hey.
-AABRIA-
You don't like it that much.
-AIMEE-
Grin and bear it.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You scoop up the gems.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You feel a memory trigger.
It's only about a week ago.
You're laying low in a little-- Village feels general, even for here.
Yeah.
Village feels generous for here.
It is a couple thatched roof, daub and wattle homes at the edge of a bog.
It's a little stinky.
It's a little like that weird mixture of cold and humid--
-AIMEE-
Ugh.
-AABRIA-
-- at the same time.
-AIMEE-
Woof.
-AABRIA-
You're like, what is the industry? Why are people here when you can be anywhere else in the world?
-AIMEE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
But it's quiet, and it's safe, and some of the individuals that you've met look like aging adventurers is the generous word you give to someone who looks like they have killed a lot of people in the past and might be laying low for another reason.
-MATT-
Mm.
-AABRIA-
But they don't ask any questions when you come.
They point you to an open home with a little nod of understanding that we didn't see you, you didn't see us.
If you need anything, no you don't.
-AIMEE-
Mm.
-ERICA-
Whoa.
-AABRIA-
It's one of those quiet evenings, the sun drops below the treeline, the smell of that bog kicks up a little more as spring peepers and little frogs and little critters in the woods get noisier, celebrating that twilight corpuscular time of day.
celebrating that twilight corpuscular time of day.
You are exiting the little room as Opal is coming in from doing something, you don't know, but you bump into each other.
-AIMEE-
Sorry.
-ANJALI-
It's okay.
You notice that, or you would see, that she's holding the two parts of the once whole tiger eye that she had before our escape.
She's holding both parts of them and moving them between her fingers.
-AIMEE-
How are you doing?
-ANJALI-
Oh, you know, I'm-- I don't know anymore.
-AIMEE-
I give her a hug.
-ANJALI-
Oh, uh--
-AIMEE-
It's okay, you can hug back.
Yeah, we'll work on it.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
Yeah, because she's holding-- (laughter)
I told you.
I told you it was important to heal things with your sister.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-ANJALI-
My-- (sighs) I've always known who Fy'ra Kai is.
She's my sister, but she's also always been, how do you say? A bit of an asshole.
-AIMEE-
(laughs) Yeah.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
But I never thought that she would, that she would want to kill me.
I don't know who she is, and she has been so much a part of who I am, even when I thought she was gone.
-AIMEE-
You know, sometimes in death or in absentia, Opal's proud that she even knew that word.
I think we tend to glorify people, their memories, at least.
It's supposed to be like that if we're never going to see them again.
But then, you see them again.
Then it's just a choice to love them.
Even if they're assholes.
Because in my case, I'm the asshole sister.
I can tell you, it comes from a place of deep insecurity.
-ANJALI-
Has Ted ever tried to kill you?
-AIMEE-
No, but I've definitely tried to kill her ass.
And I feel so bad about that.
-AABRIA-
You hear inside your head, "No, you fuckin' don't."
-AIMEE-
(scoffs) Oh, yes I do.
This isn't about you, Ted.
-AABRIA-
"You're literally talking about me."
-AIMEE-
Shut up.
Um, you know, I would be jealous of you if you were my sister, too.
You're so confident and you know so much and you can beat anybody's ass.
You're a really great person, too.
Maybe she's not any of those things and that must be really tough.
-ANJALI-
You know, when our parents named us, Fy'ra, for fire.
But Rai and Kai, two sides of a coin.
Kai for warrior.
Rai for trust.
-AIMEE-
Mm.
I look up at the crown on your head.
I see how it digs into your skin.
I don't know what is happening to you, Opal.
But you can trust me to fight for you as if you were my sister, too.
Oh, I'm definitely your sister.
Even if it's just until you get your own sister back.
A rent-a-sister.
-ANJALI-
Um.
She looks at the two halves of the tiger eye.
And takes one half.
And holds it out.
Even if it's just for now.
-AIMEE-
(whispers) Thank you.
I put it in my pocket, or somewhere close to my heart.
And I look around, and I realize I don't have anything to give her.
So I just spritz my perfume.
(laughter)
-ANJALI-
(coughs)
-AIMEE-
I know it's not much, but...
(laughter)
I just want you to know, I'll fight for you, too.
I'll beat your sister's ass if I have to.
Although, she could probably beat my ass, but-- I've often felt like the other side of a coin, too.
And it's really hard.
So, you and I can just be two coins together.
-ANJALI-
We are the richer for it.
That's her best attempt at some kind of humor.
-AIMEE-
(forced laugh) (laughter)
But she's genuinely trying to laugh, she just can't.
I'm just like, ha, ha.
-AABRIA-
Ted's like, "You've got to do better than that.
She tried so hard.
No, I swear to god, I will turn off your magic for a week. Be better."
-AIMEE-
(less forced laughs) But it comes like 30 seconds too late.
Because she was listening to the-- (laughter)
-AABRIA-
You have a feeling behind your eyes of Ted going, "Nailed it."
-ERICA-
The visual of you spraying her in the face and then her going, (cough) You going, "it's not much, but--" Like, you don't even acknowledge that she's going (coughs)
-AIMEE-
It's all I have.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ERICA-
I can't!
-ANJALI-
After her laugh, I will look down and say: I'll stay in my lane.
-AIMEE-
Have another hug.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
This time I squeeze her real, real tight.
Do I-- When I push up against her head, do I feel anything? Because that crown is there.
Do <i>I</i> feel it when I push up against it?
-AABRIA-
100%
-AIMEE-
Interesting.
-AABRIA-
You feel those thick briars made of iron scratch your scalp.
It feels, you are not poisoned, but it feels poisonous.
That idea of like, something scrapes you and you can feel it slipping under your skin and burning and traveling.
This thing does not want you to touch it, and doesn't like that its that close to you.
-ANJALI-
Excellent.
I'm going to press harder into it and I will think the words, you won't be with her for long.
-AIMEE-
Ooh!
-AABRIA-
Impressive.
-AIMEE-
Eek.
-AABRIA-
You never feel what that does.
But deep in the pit of Opal's stomach, something shakes a little queasily to her.
And we come back from that.
You are holding those gems in your hand, that's your action.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
You still have the rest of your movement and a bonus action.
-ANJALI-
All right, okay.
-AABRIA-
Those dicks are yours.
They are protected.
-AIMEE-
To keep.
-AABRIA-
You all saw that beautiful moment.
-ANJALI-
I will, okay, so I-- thank you.
-AABRIA-
Just throwing gem stones at people, like what.
-ANJALI-
Great, so--
-AABRIA-
Like Pride.
-ANJALI-
I have the rest of my movement.
Where can I get--
-AABRIA-
It's not much.
-ANJALI-
I would like to walk up the wall, because I can.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Do you enter the darkness?
-ANJALI-
Not the darkness, the one behind me.
The wall with the other gem on top of it.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, okay.
-ANJALI-
Right where that gemmy gem is.
-AABRIA-
I'm getting the little sticky guy.
So you can get up there and be, I just want you to be safe.
-ANJALI-
I want to be further away.
Well, actually-- I'll stay close to Morrighan.
-AABRIA-
You want to be here?
-ANJALI-
Yeah... yes.
Then I will just, again, spend a-- No, I won't spend a ki point.
Bonus action, eh-- Dodge, dash, disengage.
What the fuck? So many things.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Thinking in character voice is my favorite thing.
-ANJALI-
Excellent, because I can't stop this completely unplaceable accent.
-MATT-
I am Fy'ra Rai. These are my friends Dodge, Dash, and Disengage.
-ANJALI-
I have no-- (laughter)
I have no idea who I am or what is happening.
Great, so from up there, I'm going to survey the scene and I'm...
Yeah, I'm going to survey the scene.
So I can get a good vantage point of where everything is right.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
Fantastic.
-AABRIA-
I love that.
Opal.
It's time to turn this up a little bit.
-AIMEE-
Oh, naur!
-AABRIA-
Legendary action, you get to decide.
Do you want to act, do you want your sister to act? Do you want the spiders to act? Or do you want the Spider Queen to act?
-AIMEE-
Oh shit! Oh no! Not the Spider Queen.
-AABRIA-
(wishy-washy noises)
-AIMEE-
No, bitch.
-AABRIA-
"Nothing happened last time.
It could be better."
-AIMEE-
I feel like, well, Ted can't see in there.
-AABRIA-
Correct.
-AIMEE-
I'm the only one that can do anything.
-AABRIA-
Or the spiders.
-AIMEE-
Or the spiders on the outside.
I mean, I don't want to do it.
Aimee doesn't want to do anything.
-AABRIA-
Yeah.
I mean, Aimee playing Opal doesn't want to do anything.
Aimee who wants to maybe have a friend sit by you soon?
-AIMEE-
Um, okay.
So, da, da, da, da.
I am going to...
-AABRIA-
You know what? Fuck it.
Let's leave it for a roll.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Make a wisdom saving throw.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
Ooh.
11.
-AABRIA-
You feel this potential.
You know the thing, like you are the secret scared thing inside your own brain right now.
I think you understand Ted better than you ever have before.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
There's something external to you that presses in on you, it's massive, it's overwhelming, and it leans in, it grabs you.
Not by your clothing, but by the bones of your ribcage and pulls you in and says, "Kill them." "We need to go." With an 11...
"This is taking too long."
-AIMEE-
Oh no.
-ROBBIE-
(gulps)
-AABRIA-
"Drop them now."
-AIMEE-
And I have to?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-AIMEE-
Okay, so then what I'm going to do is that I am going to shoot out three Eldritch Blasts indiscriminately.
No, I mean, I can see them, so to Dorian, Dariax, and Fy'ra Rai.
-ROBBIE-
But why?
-AABRIA-
Question.
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Would-- To Opal.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Between the three of them, who's the biggest threat? Who.
There's something inside-- I'm going to bring you into the DM of it all really quickly.
A lot of times when we run encounters, you're like, "I'm a bad guy who doesn't know what the party's like."
-AIMEE-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
I'm just going to attack whoever's close.
But you've been with these people your entire adventuring life.
You know who you can drop that will make the fight a little easier.
So, behaving from the top of your intelligence, as a DM, as the primary antagonist here.
-AIMEE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
Instead of indiscriminate to all three, pick one to focus down and make it count.
-AIMEE-
Okay, I'm going to spread a little love around and I'm going to go for Dariax.
-MATT-
Bring it.
-AIMEE-
I'm sorry.
-AABRIA-
Let's go.
-AIMEE-
Okay, three Eldritch Blasts.
Here we go.
-MATT-
Does she have advantage because I'm blind?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm!
-AIMEE-
Oh! For three, I have advantage for three?
-MATT-
Hey, Dorian!
-ROBBIE-
Yeah.
-MATT-
The lights just went out.
I think I'm blind.
-AIMEE-
Do I have to remember?
-AABRIA-
The easiest way to do it is to roll two to get one at a time.
-AIMEE-
Smart.
-ROBBIE-
You can't see, but you're--
-AABRIA-
So, first one.
-AIMEE-
Okay, so 15 plus, 25.
-AABRIA-
Okay, 25.
Second one?
-AIMEE-
Oh fuck, 29.
-MATT-
Hits.
-AABRIA-
Just hits. Third one.
-AIMEE-
And 28.
-ROBBIE-
Jiminy Criminy!
-AIMEE-
I want you as my friend.
-AABRIA-
Were any of those a 19 on the die? Oh, no, no.
-MATT-
Nah, I'm not.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, yeah.
You're good.
-AIMEE-
They were not and now I get my tens.
-AABRIA-
Get your tens.
-AIMEE-
And--
-AABRIA-
3d10 plus 15.
-AIMEE-
So, two, four, six, and 13.
Plus what?
-AABRIA-
Plus 15.
-AIMEE-
Plus 15 is--
-AABRIA-
28.
-AIMEE-
28.
-MATT-
28, yeah.
-MATT-
So, Dorian I lost--
-AABRIA-
Hold on, really quick.
Just so super quick.
I would like to remind you that as the fully, invested champion of the Spider Queen, you have Baleful Scion.
And they've hit you a couple times.
-AIMEE-
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see, you can deal necrotic damage.
1d6 plus five.
Regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you hit.
-MATT-
Oh no!
-AABRIA-
So roll a d6 for me.
-AIMEE-
1d6 plus five is my bad dice.
That is a five plus five is a 10.
-AABRIA-
So that goes up to 38 points of damage and you take 10 points of healing.
-AIMEE-
Even though I'm up, oh, no I don't, I'm not up.
10 points of healing, that's perfect.
-AABRIA-
A paladin smacked the shit out of you.
-AIMEE-
That's right.
-AABRIA-
Not that long ago.
It hurted.
-AIMEE-
It hurted.
-AABRIA-
All right.
So now, with 38 points of damage, what were you saying, my darling?
-MATT-
Sorry, no worries.
I was saying to Dorian: Oh, it's just dark.
-ROBBIE-
Yes, it's dark.
You're not physically blind.
-MATT-
Oh, okay.
-ROBBIE-
I mean, technically, by definition, you can't see, therefore you're blind, but your body is okay.
-MATT-
Great, my body is-- (thudding) (laughter)
-AABRIA-
Oh no, Buddy!
-MATT-
It's not okay!
It's not okay!
-AABRIA-
Buddy! I don't like it.
-AIMEE-
I'm so sorry.
-MATT-
I'm sure it was an accident, it's fine!
-AIMEE-
It wasn't, I can't help it!
-AABRIA-
All right, anything on your bonus action?
-AIMEE-
I don't think I can do anything.
I don't think I can do anything more.
Yeah, I'm good.
Because I don't want to use a--
-AABRIA-
Yeah, this isn't your full turn.
This is just a legendary action, so yes, good.
Amazing.
Next up is-- I can read and tell numbers with my mind.
We had Fy'ra Rai go.
-ROBBIE-
Ted.
-AABRIA-
Ted is up.
Ted can't see.
-AIMEE-
Ted can't see.
-AABRIA-
But Ted did just hear that conversation.
-AABRIA-
And is going to swing a haymaker.
-MATT-
I am screaming very loud.
-ANJALI-
Poor baby.
-AABRIA-
You yelled, but you also were having a conversation in the dark and you fluttered down in front of her, so she's going to wild swing in both of your directions.
Oh shit, with disadvantage.
Does a 14 hit?
-ROBBIE-
It does not.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Second attack.
Does a 19 hit?
-ROBBIE-
It does.
-AABRIA-
Oh my god.
She swings and then comes around and is able to clip you across the chest.
-ROBBIE-
(grunts)
-AABRIA-
For-- Save me.
Nine points--
-ROBBIE-
Okay.
-AABRIA-
-- of piercing damage.
-ROBBIE-
Piercing, okay.
-AABRIA-
Piercing.
-AIMEE-
Pew, pew.
-AABRIA-
She's like, "Got one!" You can hear her be excited in your head and go, "Ooh, sorry. It's fine." It is quiet inside your group chat once more.
That's Ted's turn.
Dariax, you're up, and my little 'piders are on deck.
-MATT-
I'm up? Okay.
Dar--
-AABRIA-
Oh! Sorry.
I need you to make a-- Fuck.
-MATT-
Yeah, yeah.
What ya got? What ya need?
-AABRIA-
Please give me a concentration check.
-MATT-
Oh yeah, yeah!
-AIMEE-
Oh, finally you get to do it.
-MATT-
I got War Caster, so I have advantage on it.
-AABRIA-
Finally.
Goddamn it!
-ANJALI-
Excellent, yes!
-MATT-
That's going to be--
-AABRIA-
You have to make a 19.
That's half of--
-MATT-
Oh, that's a 22. I'm fine.
-ROBBIE-
Yeah baby!
-AABRIA-
Motherfucker!
-ANJALI-
Yeah, baby!
-AIMEE-
Oh!
-AABRIA-
I'll never get rid of Bless!
-ANJALI-
I love you!
-ROBBIE-
He's back!
-AABRIA-
I'm in hell.
-MATT-
♪ Dwarf constitution ♪ All right.
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-MATT-
Reacting from the hits, he's like, Darkness hurts! Darkness is bad.
We're going to get out of here.
I'm going to spend a few sorcery points here to do Quicken Spell.
Right, so spend two sorcery points on that.
I'm going to Quicken--
-AIMEE-
Cool! Fuck.
-MATT-
-- Dimension Door.
-AABRIA-
(gasps)
-ROBBIE-
Hey!
-ANJALI-
Yeah.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-ERICA-
Heck yeah, heck yeah, heck yeah.
-MATT-
I'm going to grab your arm, and be like: All right, I think I saw something that way.
Let's get out of here! I'm going to go (poof), try and Dimension Door us on top of that higher, the highest platform of this hill.
-ANJALI-
Yeah. Nice, nice.
-MATT-
Mind you, I don't see it right now, so I'm guessing where it is.
-AABRIA-
I believe in you.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
I believe in you.
All right, really quick, do I have to see it?
-MATT-
Dimension Door you do not have to see.
I know, because I've had people Dimension Door into dragons before.
-AABRIA-
Yes!
-ANJALI-
Ooh!
-AABRIA-
No.
-ERICA-
Into a dragon?
-AABRIA-
Ted happens to be a Mage Slayer, so.
-ANJALI-
Oh. What the fuck is that?
-AIMEE-
What is that? What the fuck is that?
-MATT-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
Someone that loves when you cast spells near them.
-ANJALI-
No!
-AABRIA-
Cool, I don't have to-- Yeah, it's going to be a melee attack with disadvantage as you go, but.
God, another-- It was a natural 20 and a three.
-AIMEE-
Aw, baby.
-MATT-
Aw.
-ANJALI-
Thank your guys' gods.
-AABRIA-
Is it, are we close to 12?
-MATT-
No.
-AABRIA-
Okay.
-ERICA-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
You go.
Damn it, Ted. (laughs) I should have given her Devil's Sight.
All right, so now you're going to make a little blind attempt to get up to here?
-MATT-
Correct.
Let me see here.
-AABRIA-
Are you taking your--
-ERICA-
There's a dick gem up there.
-ANJALI-
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, we're going to see.
-AIMEE-
There's a dick gem up there.
-AABRIA-
There's going to be two thresholds of success.
-ERCIA-
It's so big!
-AABRIA-
One to land well, two to land without crushing those.
-MATT-
I respect that.
-ERICA-
Oh no.
-ANJALI-
Oh fuck.
-AABRIA-
So, it'll be two, yeah.
Are you trying to take Dorian with you?
-MATT-
Yes.
-AABRIA-
Okay, make-- What do we want to call this? I'm going to say this can either be perception-- I just want this to be perception.
-MATT-
Hell yeah.
-AABRIA-
Just to see if you can trust vibes and land where you want to land.
-ERICA-
There's a dick gem there.
-AABRIA-
So now--
-ERICA-
There's dick a gem there.
-AABRIA-
-- a 15 is going to get both of you where you want to go.
Over a 20, you will not inadvertently crush the gems you don't see under your feet.
-ANJALI-
Okay.
-ERICA-
I think so, yeah.
-MATT-
I rolled--
-ERICA-
To my knowledge.
-MATT-
Well, I got a perception of plus one.
-AABRIA-
Oh my-- Wait, I thought you were going to-- Okay, okay, okay.
I'm so proud of you.
-MATT-
Yeah, I got a negative in my wisdom.
-AABRIA-
I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.
-MATT-
This is Dariax we're talking about.
-AABRIA-
I forgot!
-MATT-
As I grab you and both (poof).
I did roll a natural 18, which puts me at a 19.
-AIMEE-
Whoa.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-ERICA-
Get it, boy, get it!
-MATT-
I have some bardic inspiration that I recently got here.
-AIMEE-
Oh!
-AABRIA-
Let's go!
-ANJALI-
Yeah, baby!
-ROBBIE-
Save the gems!
-MATT-
25!
-AIMEE-
All right!
-ANJALI-
Yes!
-ROBBIE-
Bardy party!
-ANJALI-
Get it!
-ROBBIE-
Let's go!
-ERICA-
Bardy party! (laughs)
-ANJALI-
Bardy party.
-ERICA-
Brought my bardy for the party.
-AABRIA-
I think the thing you do, is because you know there's a height differential between the two of you, you levitate a little bit above where you want to land.
Because you're like, I don't want him to stub his legs--
-MATT-
Yeah, that's valid.
-AABRIA-
-- on the ground.
That gives you just enough eyes on the gems under your feet that you're able to go: (sudden halt)
-MATT-
(startled halt)
-AABRIA-
(laughs) Do a little splits over.
-ANJALI-
Oh no, and you knocked me down.
Oh no!
-MATT-
I feel his pain.
-ANJALI-
I was bowled over by your amazing move!
-AABRIA-
I'm sorry! It was so cool, she fell off the top.
-ANJALI-
Blown away.
-MATT-
I have that affect on people.
-ANJALI-
Yes.
-ROBBIE-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-ANJALI-
You have definitely blown me away many times.
-AABRIA-
Dariax, you do the splits.
Yeah, over the gems, under your body.
-MATT-
I'm full on, we're talking Van Damme.
-ANJALI-
Full on Van Damme!
-AABRIA-
Yeah! (cheering)
-MATT-
He's like: Oh, shiny! I still have my action.
-AABRIA-
Yeah!
-MATT-
Since I did that as a bonus action.
-ANJALI-
Amazing.
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-MATT-
Just pick them up.
-AABRIA-
Amazing.
-AIMEE-
So cool.
-ANJALI-
Yeah, baby!
-AABRIA-
You lean down, scoop up the gems.
-AIMEE-
So rad.
-AABRIA-
You feel yourself suffused with light and energy and the scent of Opal's perfume when she's not spraying it directly into your grill.
(laughter)
-AIMEE-
It's a gourmand.
-AABRIA-
It's a gor-- (laughs) Yeah, give me some notes from your fragrance.
-AIMEE-
It's vanilla.
-ERICA-
It's all I have.
-AIMEE-
It smells like the top of a crème brûlée, if you will.
-MATT-
Mm, mm.
-ANJALI-
Oh.
-AIMEE-
Very edible.
-AABRIA-
There is-- I think you go back the least far.
This is just a couple days ago when you were first taking off.
As you hit the road, there's a time in the middle of the night.
Dariax, you wake up.
You got to take your night piss.
It's an important part of your day.
-MATT-
It's like a beauty sleep.
-AABRIA-
(laughs) You see the constellation of your friends and their various sleeping accoutrement, and one empty one.
Opal, gone.
You scan around.
You see, like light bouncing off of the back of a cat's retinas, but opalescent pink in the dark, down and away, tucked between some flat sheet rock and almost behind a bush, she is back in a corner, muttering.
Her eyes are open, unfocused, unblinking.
You can hear the murmuring and the muttering.
Somehow, it's louder in your ears than it is out in the world.
-MATT-
Slowly, carefully get up from my prone sleeping position, and begin to inch over towards her, not to startle her, and be like: Hey.
Hey, Opal.
-AIMEE-
Stops muttering, but she does not have her Mask of Many Faces on.
So she looks like her corrupted self.
(gasps)
-MATT-
Opal, are you okay?
-AIMEE-
How did I get here?
-MATT-
Maybe you're having a dream.
Can I get you anything? Some water?
-AIMEE-
That's okay.
Thank you.
-MATT-
He steps up a little bit to her as she softens, not affected by her visage, and plops down next to her with his hands on his knees.
How are you doing?
-AIMEE-
Do you ever feel like you're not really here?
-MATT-
That's a very big concept.
-AIMEE-
You can do it.
I believe in you.
-MATT-
Meaning just not present, not focused?
-AIMEE-
Yeah, like-- I don't know what I'm saying.
-MATT-
No, it's okay.
You can talk to me.
-AIMEE-
Like, almost like you don't exist.
But you do.
But it's murky.
I'm just kidding.
(laughs dismissively) How are you doing?
-MATT-
He reaches over and takes your hand and just holds it for a second.
(sighs) I can't say that I've had that feeling myself.
But it hurts to think that that's what you're going through.
-AIMEE-
You know, Dariax, you're really kind.
You're a really good person.
And I also think you're pretty smart.
-MATT-
You're very sweet, too, and a terrible liar.
But, I'm getting better.
You know? I'm learning from you all.
I'm trying to be more focused in my studies.
This recorder's not playing itself anymore, you know.
-MATT-
But no, I'm-- (sporadic laughter)
I care about you.
We all care about you.
It's not lost on us that you bear a burden that I don't think any of us really understand.
I just, I look at you and I-- I feel like you feel alone, when you're not.
-AIMEE-
Oh, I have so many voices in my head, I definitely never feel alone.
But I know what you're saying.
I don't feel that way at all.
You guys are the best friends I could ever hope to have.
I just like to feel like I'm, I don't know, like I could enjoy it.
Sometimes, I just don't feel like I'm here, Sometimes, I just don't feel like I'm here, like I'm in a daze or something.
I don't know.
-MATT-
I'll tell ya what.
I've spent most of my life up to this point just picking a direction and running.
-AIMEE-
Mm.
-MATT-
It took kind of-- It took stumbling into some purpose with the rest of you nitwits to kind of, I don't know, put a little more care in what I did.
Dorian's looked after me since I began to think about making a difference, and he's protected me and shown me what it's like to have an impact and think about what that impact means to others, you know? So maybe, maybe I got to pay it forward.
And I protect you.
-AIMEE-
And I protect you.
-MATT-
I mean, I know that.
But also, don't feel like you got to be away from us over here in the dark.
It's a cold night.
-AIMEE-
It is cold.
-MATT-
Come here, come here.
I'll be big spoon.
-AIMEE-
Oh, that's really nice.
-AABRIA-
As you come over, Dariax, make a wisdom saving throw.
-MATT-
That's a 12.
-AABRIA-
You're inside this memory, and all of you can see it.
But I think, Dorian, because you're also right there, where Dariax has scooped this up, you see that the bundle of gems that Dariax holds, some of the shine goes away.
A little bit of black begins to seep across it.
Within the vision, Dariax, you don't see or remember what actually happened.
Opal doesn't walk over to you.
-AIMEE-
Hmm.
-AABRIA-
She stays far away.
-AIMEE-
So he doesn't finish the vision? The vision doesn't finish?
-AABRIA-
It's going to change.
-AIMEE-
Oh.
-AABRIA-
I will leave it-- Do you want to corrupt this memory? Or do you want me to do it?
-AIMEE-
Oh, I-- I want you to do it.
-AIMEE-
I can't.
I can't do it anymore.
(laughter)
-AABRIA-
Oh no, it got sad! I almost felt bad, but then I know I'm having a great time.
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
You see that Opal takes a step towards you, and then rocks back onto her heels.
"No."
-ANJALI-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
(laughs)
-AIMEE-
She's bowled over.
-ERICA-
She just can't stand it.
-ANJALI-
I'm just really hurt by what is happening to Opal! It's knocked me off of my axis, you know.
-AABRIA-
"Dariax, you understand I can't, right?"
-MATT-
What? What do you mean? I'm right here.
-AABRIA-
"No.
When I agreed to this, I know I did it just to look out for you all, but I made a promise.
Something's coming, and I think I have to go soon."
-MATT-
Well, wherever you go, we'll follow.
-AABRIA-
You see a flash of something across her face, a flare of anger quickly smothered.
"No.
I think where I go, I need to go by myself.
Will you let me go? Will you let me go?"
-MATT-
If you think you need to.
"You need to l--" And you see it, something warring to try to maintain the feeling of talking to Opal.
But it's not a great impression of her and it's beginning to fall away.
"You have to let me go.
Just keep going.
Get Dorian wherever he needs to go.
I have to go with her.
(through gritted teeth) You have to let me go with her."
Dorian.
"(dark) No."
Dorian!
-AABRIA-
"No!"
-AIMEE-
(startles)
-AABRIA-
"Let her go!" You see Opal's jaw opens too wide, the mandible snaps and cracks and splits apart, and she lunges for you.
-MATT-
(startled yell)
-AABRIA-
In the darkness, the vision goes away and you come back up to the present.
You're holding the gems.
-ANJALI-
We all saw that in our telepathic bond or no?
-AABRIA-
I think at first it was just that iteration, but yes, by the end that new memory started settling in for the little bit where Dariax tried to accept it.
Yeah, you all saw it.
-AIMEE-
Did I see it?
-AABRIA-
Yes.
-AIMEE-
I have no memory of what actually happened?
-AABRIA-
You remember the real memory, but you are starting to slip back farther and farther.
-AIMEE-
Okay. I think I telepathically say: I don't think that's what happened.
-AABRIA-
"Be quiet.
I'm trying to let them go peacefully.
If they stay, my champion, I will make you kill them.
You understand that, right?"
-AIMEE-
Yes, I understand.
-AABRIA-
"So you make them go, or I do."
-AIMEE-
Guys, maybe you should go.
-AABRIA-
We come back to the present.
One more action.
Do you want to go, do you want the spiders to go, or do you want the Spider Queen to go?
-AIMEE-
Definitely not the Spider Queen.
The spiders can go.
-AABRIA-
Spiders activated.
-ANJALI-
Can I put myself back on the wall?
-AABRIA-
Oh yeah! Let's get you back up, buddy.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-ERICA-
She's prone.
It's the rules.
-AIMEE-
She had a great fall.
-AABRIA-
Hey, you've got to stop drinking before we go into these fights.
-ANJALI-
I mean, I'm really cut off.
-MATT-
(laughs)
-AABRIA-
Spiders, let's see, this one.
This is what I'm going to do.
This one's going to begin trying to climb up, and I think it's only going to get to about there.
We're going to have this one come around the corner.
He can't quite get to you to fight you.
This spider back here is going to destroy gems.
Opal, it happens so quickly you don't even feel the memory.
They're getting better at this.
It's smoother and easier.
This spider is going to lunge for Cyrus.
And this one, we'll have it climb up and it's going to join.
We'll have this one come up here and then it will be in melee for the next round.
-ERICA-
I imagined it with tiny little knives.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, it's just moving.
-AABRIA-
Just little tiny knives.
It's like, have you ever seen those TikTok videos of them crushing the apple snail eggs?
-MATT-
Yeah!
-AABRIA-
That's all I can think of when it's smushing those gems.
It's like, forbidden Gushers.
I love it.
-MATT-
I'll show you after, it's terrifying.
-AABRIA-
Yeah, it's so good.
-ANJALI-
I don't know that I want to see it.
-AABRIA-
All righty, Cyrus is going to take one off big spider.
That will hit.
You all see that big bubble butt spider leap unto Cyrus and tackle him to the ground, and its mandibles come and they pinch into his shoulder.
-ROBBIE-
(unhappy noise)
-AABRIA-
Just, "Gah! (gasping)" And he begins to frantically tear away at his clothing like he's on fire.
Like he needs to get to his skin.
And you all see that blue gets shot through as the veins in his shoulders begin to pulse a sickly green.
-ERICA-
Eww!
-AABRIA-
He is prone and under the poisoned condition.
-ROBBIE-
Oh god. And prone?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-MATT-
Buddy.
-ROBBIE-
Oh, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
-AABRIA-
He did his best.
And that's fine.
The rest of them smush in.
Smushing your personality.
You can feel it begin to fall away.
The threats are not idle.
And there's something inside of the Spider Queen that is beginning to panic.
It's taking too long.
She needs something new to happen.
First, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
The difficulty is 20.
-ANJALI-
Oh, come on, girl.
Come on, girl!
-ROBBIE-
Dang!
-AIMEE-
All right.
Fuck, that is a 13.
-AABRIA-
You feel something inside you begin to bubble over and you start to make a noise.
It comes from deep and it's like a groan, not quite a scream, and Ted turns and locks on you, even within the darkness, and is going to run and sprint, and dives into your body.
-ERICA-
What's that?
-ANJALI-
What?
-AABRIA-
And disappears from sight.
-AIMEE-
Oh shit.
Okay, what does that mean?
-AABRIA-
And the rest of you-- Oh, we'll find out in a second.
The rest of you, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
-ROBBIE-
Uh-oh.
-AABRIA-
Difficulty is 20.
-ROBBIE-
What!
-ERICA-
Um, okay.
-AABRIA-
You still have Bless up.
-ERICA-
Oh, okay.
-AABRIA-
And people within 10 feet of you.
which feels like, I think you can Fy'ra Rai in that.
-ERICA-
Okay.
-ANJALI-
24.
-ERICA-
Oh, 17, 18, 19.
-AABRIA-
I can never get anyone.
-ERICA-
20, 22-- 25.
-AABRIA-
Yep.
-ERICA-
So even without anything.
-AABRIA-
Oh, perfect.
How'd you do?
-ROBBIE-
I mean, even if I try, I still wouldn't make it, fail.
11.
-MATT-
Nine.
-AABRIA-
You both see, from your vantage point, something horrendous.
What's the worst thing you could see on the battlefield right now?
-MATT-
Oh, um-- The worst, in this moment? Would be-- A true sign of losing Opal.
Seeing her become something that is beyond our reach, probably.
-AABRIA-
And there it is, in front of your eyes.
You see here double over in pain.
As arms burst through.
As her lower body swells and becomes grotesque.
A drider body forms out from under her and she rises to about 12 feet tall.
Her head turns and looks at you and eyes open, jet black, weeping black ihchor.
Ichor, I don't know how to say that.
And other sets of eyes open up.
Multiples looking at you.
And when she opens her mouth to scream, it's just like in your memory vision, the lie, the truth, you can barely remember anymore.
As she laughs.
Dorian.
What's the worst thing you could see on the battlefield right now?
-ROBBIE-
Oh no.
-AIMEE-
This is in their mind's eye, right? Because I still have Darkness up.
-AABRIA-
You do still have Darkness up.
-AIMEE-
Ay yi.
I didn't mean to remind you.
-AABRIA-
No, no, no.
You're correct.
It is a convenient slip of fiction that when Dariax saw that, he no longer saw the darkness that would've obscured you.
Good catch.
-ROBBIE-
I think it's, the worst thing?
-AABRIA-
Mm-hmm.
-ROBBIE-
Stuff worse than death, I think it's everyone corrupted.
So like, when we were on that door to the Feywild and Fearne saw a version of herself, I think that horrifies Dorian worse than anything.
Full corruption.
So I think he would see shadow images of the people that he loves at their worst.
-AABRIA-
It's like all of your friends, your brother, are suddenly looking in a mirror and then that mirror version, like burned Fearne, reaches through and grabs them and pulls them in.
And then steps out to replace them.
-AIMEE-
Ugh!
-AABRIA-
And whatever position their bodies were at the time, their heads turn unnaturally at an angle to look up at you to make sure that you know, that they know, that what has come to pass, the worst thing in your heart is true.
No one else sees that, just you two.
But what you do see.
The Spider Queen is done fucking around.
She wanted to do this the easy way.
Now she's going to do it the hard way.
And she's going to make you be the tool of your own severance.
Opal, you get taller, you begin the stretch out.
You're already lanky, kind of a model.
-AIMEE-
I mean, yeah.
That's true.
-AABRIA-
You are now a full 6'5".
Two sets of arms holding daggers, holding crystalline swords.
Weep.
Just weeping wounds from your head, a crown, another crown.
And when you smile, that same black ichor pours from the side of your mouth.
As you are joined with a third set of arms.
Opal, Ted, and the Spider Queen in unison.
And that's where we're going to pick up next week.
-ALL-
Whoa!
-ERICA-
Oh my god.
-AABRIA-
Yeah! I'm sending someone home!
-ERICA-
The stress!
-AABRIA-
Y'all got the first day paycheck.
-ERICA-
The stress of it all.
-AABRIA-
We're done!
-MATT-
Well, that all feels real bad!
-AABRIA-
It's totally fine.
It's probably fine.
-ROBBIE-
Almost like the worst thing you could imagine.
-ERICA-
It feels so bad.
-AABRIA-
Everyone's doing super good and you're totally on the top right now and you'll probably never fall again.
So I think everyone's doing really well and I'm super proud of them.
So, we're just going to call it here.
-ERICA-
<i>I</i> wouldn't get too comfy.
I have some things.
-AIMEE-
I've got Haste and I will cast it on Opal!
-ERICA-
You know what, I've got Haste--
-AABRIA-
If you had cast it on Opal, this whole thing would be different!
-ERICA-
I will be up at 3:00am thinking about how stupid that was, I will.
-MATT-
No, no, that was great.
-AIMEE-
Not dumber than me trying to do Eldritch Blast with d4s.
Okay.
-AABRIA-
I see someone who's like, "Help, no.
I did negative two damage to my friends." No, no.
Next time, you're collecting bodies.
You get that, right?
-AIMEE-
I do.
-AABRIA-
So get excited.
-AIMEE-
Well.
-AABRIA-
You too.
But until next week, be good, treat each other well, But until next week, be good, treat each other well, and is it Thursday yet? Ooh! (cheering)
